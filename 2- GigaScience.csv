Although many knowledge shortfalls remain, some high-quality data sets on biological interactions are now available. The development and adoption of standards for biodiversity data and metadata has promoted great advances in biological data sharing and aggregation, supporting large-scale studies and science-based public policies. However, these standards are currently not suitable to fully support interaction data sharing. RESULTS: Here we present a vocabulary of terms and a data model for sharing plant-pollinator interactions data based on the Darwin Core standard. The vocabulary introduces 48 new terms targeting several aspects of plant-pollinator interactions and can be used to capture information from different approaches and scales. Additionally, we provide solutions for data serialization using RDF, XML, and DwC-Archives and recommendations of existing controlled vocabularies for some of the terms. Our contribution supports open access to standardized data on plant-pollinator interactions. CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of the vocabulary would facilitate data sharing to support studies ranging from the spatial and temporal distribution of interactions to the taxonomic, phenological, functional, and phylogenetic aspects of plant-pollinator interactions. We expect to fill data and knowledge gaps, thus further enabling scientific research on the ecology and evolution of plant-pollinator communities, biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, and the development of public policies. The proposed data model is flexible and can be adapted for sharing other types of interactions data by developing discipline-specific vocabularies of terms. © The Author(s) 2022.

These microbial resource centers thus need to implement new standards in species delineation, including whole-genome sequencing and phylogenomics. In this context, the genomic needs of the Belgian Coordinated Collections of Microorganisms were studied, resulting in the GEN-ERA toolbox. The latter is a unified cluster of bioinformatic workflows dedicated to both bacteria and small eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts). Findings: This public toolbox allows researchers without a specific training in bioinformatics to perform robust phylogenomic analyses. Hence, it facilitates all steps from genome downloading and quality assessment, including genomic contamination estimation, to tree reconstruction. It also offers workflows for average nucleotide identity comparisons and metabolic modeling. Technical details: Nextflow workflows are launched by a single command and are available on the GEN-ERA GitHub repository (https://github.com/Lcornet/GENERA). All the workflows are based on Singularity containers to increase reproducibility. Testing: The toolbox was developed for a diversity of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. It was further tested on an empirical dataset of 18 (meta)genomes of early branching Cyanobacteria, providing the most up-to-date phylogenomic analysis of the Gloeobacterales order, the first group to diverge in the evolutionary tree of Cyanobacteria. Conclusion: The GEN-ERA toolbox can be used to infer completely reproducible comparative genomic and metabolic analyses on prokaryotes and small eukaryotes. Although designed for routine bioinformatics of culture collections, it can also be used by all researchers interested in microbial taxonomy, as exemplified by our case study on Gloeobacterales. © The Author(s) 2023.

However, our understanding of maternal proteins is still very limited. The integrated analysis of mouse uniparental (parthenogenetic) and biparental (fertilized) embryos at the protein level creates a protein expression landscape that can be used to explore preimplantation mouse development. Results: Using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, we report on the maternal proteome of mouse parthenogenetic embryos at pronucleus, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst stages and highlight dynamic changes in protein expression. In addition, comparison of proteomic profiles of parthenogenotes and fertilized embryos highlights the different fates of maternal proteins. Enrichment analysis uncovered a set of maternal proteins that are strongly correlated with the subcortical maternal complex, and we report that in parthenogenotes, some of these maternal proteins escape the fate of protein degradation. Moreover, we identified a new maternal factor-Fbxw24, and highlight its importance in early embryonic development. We report that Fbxw24 interacts with Ddb1-Cul4b and may regulate maternal protein degradation in mouse. Conclusions: Our study provides an invaluable resource for mechanistic analysis of maternal proteins and highlights the role of the novel maternal factor Fbw24 in regulating maternal protein degradation during preimplantation embryo development.  © 2022 The Author(s).

First, we leverage the NeuroVault database to train, on a selection of relevant statistic maps, a convolutional autoencoder to reconstruct these maps. Then, we use this trained encoder to initialize a supervised convolutional neural network to classify tasks or cognitive processes of unseen statistic maps from large collections of the NeuroVault database. Results: We show that such a self-taught learning process always improves the performance of the classifiers, but the magnitude of the benefits strongly depends on the number of samples available both for pretraining and fine-tuning the models and on the complexity of the targeted downstream task.

Repetitive sequences, which accounted for 42.34% of the assembly length, were identified. In total, 33,229 protein-coding genes and 11,474 small noncoding RNAs were predicted. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that C. arbutifolia and poplars diverged approximately 15.3 million years ago, and a large interchromosomal recombination between C. arbutifolia and other Salicaceae species was discovered. Conclusions: Our study provides insights into the genome architecture and systematic evolution of C. arbutifolia, as well as comprehensive information for germplasm protection and future functional genomic studies.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Sharing these workflows provides researchers easy access to high-quality analysis methods without the requirement of computational expertise. However, published workflows are not always guaranteed to be reliably reusable. Therefore, a system is needed to lower the cost of sharing workflows in a reusable form. Results: We introduce Yevis, a system to build a workflow registry that automatically validates and tests workflows to be published. The validation and test are based on the requirements we defined for a workflow being reusable with confidence. Yevis runs on GitHub and Zenodo and allows workflow hosting without the need of dedicated computing resources. A Yevis registry accepts workflow registration via a GitHub pull request, followed by an automatic validation and test process for the submitted workflow. As a proof of concept, we built a registry using Yevis to host workflows from a community to demonstrate how a workflow can be shared while fulfilling the defined requirements. Conclusions: Yevis helps in the building of a workflow registry to share reusable workflows without requiring extensive human resources. By following Yevis’s workflow-sharing procedure, one can operate a registry while satisfying the reusable workflow criteria. This system is particularly useful to individuals or communities that want to share workflows but lacks the specific technical expertise to build and maintain a workflow registry from scratch. © The Author(s) 2023.

Its sex, however, cannot be distinguished clearly at any development stage, which impedes captive breeding and species protection for this endangered aquarium fish. Results: To discover molecular clues to the sex of Asian arowana, we sequenced 26.5 Gb of PacBio HiFi reads and 179.2 Gb of Hi-C reads for 1 male fish and also sequenced 106.5 Gb of Illumina reads, 36.0 Gb of PacBio Sequel reads, and 80.7 Gb of Hi-C reads for 1 female individual. The final male and female genome assemblies were approximately 756.8 Mb and 781.5 Mb in length and contained 25,262 and 25,328 protein-coding genes, respectively. We also resequenced the genomes of 15 male and 15 female individuals with approximately 722.1 Gb of Illumina reads. A genome-wide association study identified several potentially divergent regions between male and female individuals. In these regions, cd48 and cfap52 could be candidate genes for sex determination of Asian arowana. We also found some structural variations in few chromosomes between male and female individuals. Conclusion: We provided an improved reference genome assembly of female arowana and generated the first sequenced genome of 1 male individual.

However, the genetic alterations underlying cashmere trait selection are still unclear. We sequenced 120 Chinese native goats, including 2 cashmere goat breeds and 6 ordinary goat breeds. The genome-wide selective sweep of cashmere goat and ordinary goat revealed a novel set of candidate genes as well as pathways, such as nuclear factor-κB and Wnt signaling pathways. Of them, LHX2, regulating hair follicle development, was evident from the strongest selection signal when comparing the Uhumqin cashmere goat and ordinary goat. Interestingly, we identified a 582-bp deletion at 367 kb upstream of LHX2 with higher frequency in cashmere goats and their ancient relatives. This mutation probably arose along with breeding procedures and is putatively responsible for cashmere production and diameter, as revealed by association studies. Luciferase assay showed that the 582-bp sequence, which acts as an insulator, restrains the expression of LHX2 by interfering with its upstream enhancers. Our findings provide new insights into the genetic formation of cashmere and facilitate subsequent molecular breeding for cashmere goat improvement.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Recent whole-genome studies in Eastern Europe, one in Ukraine and one in Russia, demonstrated that local genome diversity and population structure from Eastern Europe historically had not been fully represented.

JupyterLab provides an excellent framework for developing AI programs, but it needs to be hosted on such an infrastructure to enable faster training of AI programs using parallel computing. Findings: An open-source, docker-based, and GPU-enabled JupyterLab infrastructure is developed that runs on the public compute infrastructure of Galaxy Europe consisting of thousands of CPU cores, many GPUs, and several petabytes of storage to rapidly prototype and develop end-to-end AI projects. Using a JupyterLab notebook, long-running AI model training programs can also be executed remotely to create trained models, represented in open neural network exchange (ONNX) format, and other output datasets in Galaxy. Other features include Git integration for version control, the option of creating and executing pipelines of notebooks, and multiple dashboards and packages for monitoring compute resources and visualization, respectively. Conclusions: These features make JupyterLab in Galaxy Europe highly suitable for creating and managing AI projects. A recent scientific publication that predicts infected regions in COVID-19 computed tomography scan images is reproduced using various features of JupyterLab on Galaxy Europe. In addition, ColabFold, a faster implementation of AlphaFold2, is accessed in JupyterLab to predict the 3-dimensional structure of protein sequences.

The Parvoviridae family includes a different group of viruses that can infect a wide variety of animals. In this study, systematic analysis was performed to identify the “dark matter” (datasets that cannot be easily attributed to known viruses) of parvoviruses and to explore their genetic diversity from wild birds’ cloacal swab samples. We have tentatively defined this parvovirus “dark matter” as a highly divergent lineage in the Parvoviridae family. All parvoviruses showed several characteristics, including 2 major protein-coding genes and similar genome lengths. Moreover, we observed that the novel parvo-like viruses share similar genome organizations to most viruses in Parvoviridae but could not clustered with the established subfamilies in phylogenetic analysis. We also found some new members associated with the Bidnaviridae family, which may be derived from parvovirus.

Recent computing technologies, such as virtualization, have made it possible to reproduce workflow execution with ease. However, the reproducibility of results is not well discussed; that is, there is no standard way to verify whether the biological interpretation of reproduced results is the same. Therefore, it still remains a challenge to automatically evaluate the reproducibility of results. Results: We propose a new metric, a reproducibility scale of workflow execution results, to evaluate the reproducibility of results. This metric is based on the idea of evaluating the reproducibility of results using biological feature values (e.g., number of reads, mapping rate, and variant frequency) representing their biological interpretation. We also implemented a prototype system that automatically evaluates the reproducibility of results using the proposed metric. To demonstrate our approach, we conducted an experiment using workflows used by researchers in real research projects and the use cases that are frequently encountered in the field of bioinformatics. Conclusions: Our approach enables automatic evaluation of the reproducibility of results using a fine-grained scale. By introducing our approach, it is possible to evolve from a binary view of whether the results are superficially identical or not to a more graduated view. We believe that our approach will contribute to more informed discussion on reproducibility in bioinformatics. © The Author(s) 2023.

The biodiversity of the honey bee in parts of its native range is endangered by migratory beekeeping and commercial breeding. In consequence, some honey bee populations that are well adapted to the local environment are threatened with extinction. A crucial step for the protection of honey bee biodiversity is reliable differentiation between native and nonnative bees. One of the methods that can be used for this is the geometric morphometrics of wings. This method is fast, is low cost, and does not require expensive equipment. Therefore, it can be easily used by both scientists and beekeepers. However, wing geometric morphometrics is challenging due to the lack of reference data that can be reliably used for comparisons between different geographic regions. Findings: Here, we provide an unprecedented collection of 26,481 honey bee wing images representing 1,725 samples from 13 European countries. The wing images are accompanied by the coordinates of 19 landmarks and the geographic coordinates of the sampling locations.We present an R script that describes the workflow for analyzing the data and identifying an unknown sample.We compared the data with available reference samples for lineage and found general agreement with them. Conclusions: The extensive collection of wing images available on the Zenodo website can be used to identify the geographic origin of unknown samples and therefore assist in the monitoring and conservation of honey bee biodiversity in Europe.  © The Author(s) 2023.","Adaptation, Physiological; Agriculture; Animals; Bees; Biodiversity; Europe; Pollination; Apis mellifera; article; beekeeper; biodiversity; controlled study; Europe; geographic origin; human; major clinical study; morphometry; nonhuman; wing; workflow; adaptation; agriculture; animal; bee; pollination","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151043700"

Some tools for assessment of variant pathogenicity as well as annotations are not available for the current human genome build (GRCh38), for which the adoption in databases, software, and pipelines was slow. Results: Here, we present an updated version of the Regulatory Mendelian Mutation (ReMM) score, retrained on features and variants derived from the GRCh38 genome build. Like its GRCh37 version, it achieves good performance on its highly imbalanced data. To improve accessibility and provide users with a toolbox to score their variant files and look up scores in the genome, we developed a website and API for easy score lookup. Conclusions: Scores of the GRCh38 genome build are highly correlated to the prior release with a performance increase due to the better coverage of features. For prioritization of noncoding mutations in imbalanced datasets, the ReMM score performed much better than other variation scores.

Three-dimensional structures of related proteins in complexes with other proteins, nucleic acids, or ligands enrich such functional interpretation, since intermolecular interactions are well conserved in evolution. Results: We present d-StructMAn, a novel computational method that enables structural annotation of local genetic variants, such as single-nucleotide variants and in-frame indels, and implements it in a highly efficient and user-friendly tool provided as a Docker container. Using d-StructMAn, we annotated several very large sets of human genetic variants, including all variants from ClinVar and all amino acid positions in the human proteome. We were able to provide annotation for more than 46% of positions in the human proteome representing over 60% proteins. Conclusions: d-StructMAn is the first of its kind and a highly efficient tool for structural annotation of protein-coding genetic variation in the context of observed and potential intermolecular interactions. d-StructMAn is readily applicable to proteome-scale datasets and can be an instrumental building machine-learning tool for predicting genotype-to-phenotype relationships.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Here, we report a chromosome-level genome assembly of Lion-head goose (Anser cygnoides), a native breed in South China, through the combination of PacBio, Bionano, and Hi-C technologies. Findings: The assembly had a total genome size of 1.19 Gb, consisting of 1,859 contigs with an N50 length of 20.59 Mb, generating 40 pseudochromosomes, representing 97.27% of the assembled genome, and identifying 21,208 protein-coding genes. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that geese and ducks diverged approximately 28.42 million years ago, and geese have undergone massive gene family expansion and contraction. To identify genetic markers associated with body weight in different geese breeds, including Wuzong goose, Huangzong goose, Magang goose, and Lion-head goose, a genome-wide association study was performed, yielding an average of 1,520.6 Mb of raw data that detected 44,858 single-mucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genome-wide association study showed that 6 SNPs were significantly associated with body weight and 25 were potentially associated. The significantly associated SNPs were annotated as LDLRAD4, GPR180, and OR, enriching in growth factor receptor regulation pathways. Conclusions: We present the first chromosome-level assembly of the Lion-head goose genome, which will expand the genomic resources of the Anatidae family, providing a basis for adaptation and evolution. Candidate genes significantly associated with different goose breeds may serve to understand the underlying mechanisms of weight differences. © The Author(s) 2023.

Although the Korean Developmental Screening Test for Infants and Children (K-DST) can accurately assess childhood development, its dependence on parental surveys rather than reliable, professional observation limits it. This study constructed a dataset based on a skeleton of recordings of K-DST behaviors in children aged between 20 and 71 months, with and without developmental disorders. The dataset was validated using a child behavior artificial intelligence (AI) learning model to highlight its possibilities. Results: The 339 participating children were divided into 3 groups by age. We collected videos of 4 behaviors by age group from 3 different angles and extracted skeletons from them. The raw data were used to annotate labels for each image, denoting whether each child performed the behavior properly. Behaviors were selected from the K-DST’s gross motor section. The number of images collected differed by age group. The original dataset underwent additional processing to improve its quality. Finally, we confirmed that our dataset can be used in the AI model with 93.94%, 87.50%, and 96.31% test accuracy for the 3 age groups in an action recognition model. Additionally, the models trained with data including multiple views showed the best performance. Conclusion: Ours is the first publicly available dataset that constitutes skeleton-based action recognition in young children according to the standardized criteria (K-DST). This dataset will enable the development of various models for developmental tests and screenings. © The Author(s) 2023.","Artificial Intelligence; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Humans; Infant; Learning; artificial intelligence; child; child development; human; infant; learning; preschool child","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160380414"

Such information is dispersed in the texts of several research articles, hindering the possibility of practically integrating it with related datasets (e.g., millions of SARS-CoV-2 sequences available to the community). We aim to fill this gap, by mining literature abstracts to extract-for each variant/mutation-its related effects (in epidemiological, immunological, clinical, or viral kinetics terms) with labeled higher/lower levels in relation to the nonmutated virus. RESULTS: The proposed framework comprises (i) the provisioning of abstracts from a COVID-19-related big data corpus (CORD-19) and (ii) the identification of mutation/variant effects in abstracts using a GPT2-based prediction model. The above techniques enable the prediction of mutations/variants with their effects and levels in 2 distinct scenarios: (i) the batch annotation of the most relevant CORD-19 abstracts and (ii) the on-demand annotation of any user-selected CORD-19 abstract through the CoVEffect web application (http://gmql.eu/coveffect), which assists expert users with semiautomated data labeling. On the interface, users can inspect the predictions and correct them; user inputs can then extend the training dataset used by the prediction model. Our prototype model was trained through a carefully designed process, using a minimal and highly diversified pool of samples. CONCLUSIONS: The CoVEffect interface serves for the assisted annotation of abstracts, allowing the download of curated datasets for further use in data integration or analysis pipelines. The overall framework can be adapted to resolve similar unstructured-to-structured text translation tasks, which are typical of biomedical domains. © The Author(s) 2023.

Most studies in the field of ant behavior have focused only on indoor environments (a laboratory setup), while outdoor environments (natural environments) are still underexplored. Findings: In this article, we collect 10 videos of 3 species of ant colonies from different scenes, including 5 indoor and 5 outdoor scenes. We develop an image sequence marking software named VisualMarkData, which enables us to provide annotations of the ants in the videos. (i) It offers comprehensive annotations of states at the individual-target and colony-target levels. (ii) It provides a simple matrix format to represent multiple targets and multiple groups of annotations (along with their IDs and behavior labels). (iii) During the annotation process, we propose a simple and effective visualization that takes the annotation information of the previous frame as a reference, and then a user can simply click on the center point of each target to complete the annotation task. (iv) We develop a user-friendly window-based GUI to minimize labor and maximize annotation quality. In all 5,354 frames, the location information and the identification number of each ant are recorded for a total of 712 ants and 114,112 annotations. Moreover, we provide visual analysis tools to assess and validate the technical quality and reproducibility of our data. Conclusions: We provide a large-scale ant dataset with the accompanying annotation software. It is hoped that our work will contribute to a deeper exploration of the behavior of ant colonies.  © 2022 The Author(s).

State-of-the-art algorithms have a tendency to produce less accurate alignments with an increasing number of sequences. This is a fundamental problem since many downstream tasks rely on accurate alignments. Results: We present learnMSA, a novel statistical learning approach of profile hidden Markov models (pHMMs) based on batch gradient descent. Fundamentally different from popular aligners, we fit a custom recurrent neural network architecture for (p)HMMs to potentially millions of sequences with respect to a maximum a posteriori objective and decode an alignment. We rely on automatic differentiation of the log-likelihood, and thus, our approach is different from existing HMM training algorithms like Baum-Welch. Our method does not involve progressive, regressive, or divide-and-conquer heuristics. We use uniform batch sampling to adapt to large datasets in linear time without the requirement of a tree. When tested on ultra-large protein families with up to 3.5 million sequences, learnMSA is both more accurate and faster than state-of-the-art tools. On the established benchmarks HomFam and BaliFam with smaller sequence sets, it matches state-of-the-art performance. All experiments were done on a standard workstation with a GPU. Conclusions: Our results show that learnMSA does not share the counterintuitive drawback of many popular heuristic aligners, which can substantially lose accuracy when many additional homologs are input. LearnMSA is a future-proof framework for large alignments with many opportunities for further improvements.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Findings: Here we provide phenotypic data for the resistance against Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of wheat powdery mildew—a substantial risk to our agricultural production. Using a modern high-throughput phenotyping system, we infected and photographed a total of 113,638 wheat leaves of 7,320 winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plant genetic resources of the German Federal ex situ Genebank for Agricultural and Horticultural Crops and 154 commercial genotypes. We quantified the resistance reaction captured by images and provide them here, along with the raw images.

As a result, measured signals lack correspondence over replicates of the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) experiments. Correction of these errors is named retention time alignment and needs to be performed before further quantitative analysis. Despite the availability of numerous alignment algorithms, their accuracy is limited (e.g., for retention time drift that swaps analytes' elution order). Results: We present the Alignstein, an algorithm for LC-MS retention time alignment. It correctly finds correspondence even for swapped signals. To achieve this, we implemented the generalization of the Wasserstein distance to compare multidimensional features without any reduction of the information or dimension of the analyzed data. Moreover, Alignstein by design requires neither a reference sample nor prior signal identification. We validate the algorithm on publicly available benchmark datasets obtaining competitive results. Finally, we show that it can detect the information contained in the tandem mass spectrum by the spatial properties of chromatograms. Conclusions: We show that the use of optimal transport effectively overcomes the limitations of existing algorithms for statistical analysis of mass spectrometry datasets.

We demonstrated the efficiency of this approach by correctly assembling and annotating all exons from the chicken SCO-spondin gene (containing more than 105 exons), including the identification of missing genes in the chicken reference annotations by homology assignments.

Analyzing heterogeneous datasets and additional derived data requires rigorous tracking of their interrelationships and provenance. This task has long been a Grand Challenge of data science and has more recently been formalized in the FAIR principles: that all data objects be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, both for machines and for people. Adherence to these principles is necessary for proper stewardship of information, for testing regulatory compliance, for measuring the efficiency of processes, and for facilitating reuse of data-analytical frameworks. Findings: We present the Contextual Ontology-based Repository Analysis Library (CORAL), a platform that greatly facilitates adherence to all 4 of the FAIR principles, including the especially difficult challenge of making heterogeneous datasets Interoperable and Reusable across all parts of a large, long-lasting organization. To achieve this, CORAL's data model requires that data generators extensively document the context for all data, and our tools maintain that context throughout the entire analysis pipeline. CORAL also features a web interface for data generators to upload and explore data, as well as a Jupyter notebook interface for data analysts, both backed by a common API. Conclusions: CORAL enables organizations to build FAIR data types on the fly as they are needed, avoiding the expense of bespoke data modeling. CORAL provides a uniquely powerful platform to enable integrative cross-dataset analyses, generating deeper insights than are possible using traditional analysis tools.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Detecting and removing true contaminants is challenging, especially in low-biomass samples or in studies lacking proper controls. Interactive visualizations and analysis platforms are crucial to better guide this step, to help to identify and detect noisy patterns that could potentially be contamination. Additionally, external evidence, like aggregation of several contamination detection methods and the use of common contaminants reported in the literature, could help to discover and mitigate contamination. Results: We propose GRIMER, a tool that performs automated analyses and generates a portable and interactive dashboard integrating annotation, taxonomy, and metadata. It unifies several sources of evidence to help detect contamination. GRIMER is independent of quantification methods and directly analyzes contingency tables to create an interactive and offline report. Reports can be created in seconds and are accessible for nonspecialists, providing an intuitive set of charts to explore data distribution among observations and samples and its connections with external sources. Further, we compiled and used an extensive list of possible external contaminant taxa and common contaminants with 210 genera and 627 species reported in 22 published articles.

Here we link a high-quality de novo long-read chromosomal assembly with epigenetic footprints and morphology to describe the Alpine dingo female named Cooinda. It was critical to establish an Alpine dingo reference because this ecotype occurs throughout coastal eastern Australia where the first drawings and descriptions were completed. Findings: We generated a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome assembly (Canfam_ADS) using a combination of Pacific Bioscience, Oxford Nanopore, 10X Genomics, Bionano, and Hi-C technologies. Compared to the previously published Desert dingo assembly, there are large structural rearrangements on chromosomes 11, 16, 25, and 26. Phylogenetic analyses of chromosomal data from Cooinda the Alpine dingo and 9 previously published de novo canine assemblies show dingoes are monophyletic and basal to domestic dogs. Network analyses show that the mitochondrial DNA genome clusters within the southeastern lineage, as expected for an Alpine dingo. Comparison of regulatory regions identified 2 differentially methylated regions within glucagon receptor GCGR and histone deacetylase HDAC4 genes that are unmethylated in the Alpine dingo genome but hypermethylated in the Desert dingo. Morphologic data, comprising geometric morphometric assessment of cranial morphology, place dingo Cooinda within population-level variation for Alpine dingoes. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain tissue shows she had a larger cranial capacity than a similar-sized domestic dog. Conclusions: These combined data support the hypothesis that the dingo Cooinda fits the spectrum of genetic and morphologic characteristics typical of the Alpine ecotype. We propose that she be considered the archetype specimen for future research investigating the evolutionary history, morphology, physiology, and ecology of dingoes.

Such information is dispersed in the texts of several research articles, hindering the possibility of practically integrating it with related datasets (e.g., millions of SARS-CoV-2 sequences available to the community). We aim to fill this gap, by mining literature abstracts to extract—for each variant/mutation—its related effects (in epidemiological, immunological, clinical, or viral kinetics terms) with labeled higher/lower levels in relation to the nonmutated virus. Results: The proposed framework comprises (i) the provisioning of abstracts from a COVID-19–related big data corpus (CORD-19) and (ii) the identification of mutation/variant effects in abstracts using a GPT2-based prediction model. The above techniques enable the prediction of mutations/variants with their effects and levels in 2 distinct scenarios: (i) the batch annotation of the most relevant CORD-19 abstracts and (ii) the on-demand annotation of any user-selected CORD-19 abstract through the CoVEffect web application (http://gmql.eu/coveffect), which assists expert users with semiautomated data labeling. On the interface, users can inspect the predictions and correct them; user inputs can then extend the training dataset used by the prediction model. Our prototype model was trained through a carefully designed process, using a minimal and highly diversified pool of samples. Conclusions: The CoVEffect interface serves for the assisted annotation of abstracts, allowing the download of curated datasets for further use in data integration or analysis pipelines. The overall framework can be adapted to resolve similar unstructured-to-structured text translation tasks, which are typical of biomedical domains. © The Author(s) 2023.

A high-quality tiger genome assembly will be an important tool for conservation genetics, especially for the Indian tiger, the most abundant subspecies in the wild. Here, we present high-quality near-chromosomal genome assemblies of a female and a male wild Indian tiger (Panthera tigris tigris). Our assemblies had a scaffold N50 of >140 Mb, with 19 scaffolds corresponding to the 19 numbered chromosomes, containing 95% of the genome. Our assemblies also enabled detection of longer stretches of runs of homozygosity compared to previous assemblies, which will help improve estimates of genomic inbreeding. Comprehensive genome annotation identified 26,068 protein-coding genes, including several gene families involved in key morphological features such as the teeth, claws, vision, olfaction, taste, and body stripes. We also identified 301 microRNAs, 365 small nucleolar RNAs, 632 transfer RNAs, and other noncoding RNA elements, several of which are predicted to regulate key biological pathways that likely contribute to the tiger’s apex predatory traits. We identify signatures of positive selection in the tiger genome that are consistent with the Panthera lineage.

It has been demonstrated that, besides the major canonical transcripts, the viral genome also codes for noncanonical RNA molecules. While the structural characterizations have revealed a detailed transcriptomic architecture of the virus, the kinetic studies provided poor and often misleading results on the dynamics of both the viral and host transcripts due to the low temporal resolution of the infection event and the low virus/cell ratio (multiplicity of infection [MOI] = 0.1) applied for the infection. It has never been tested whether the alteration in the host gene expressions is caused by aging of the cells or by the viral infection. Findings: In this study, we used Oxford Nanopore's direct cDNA and direct RNA sequencing methods for the generation of a high-coverage, high temporal resolution transcriptomic dataset of SARS-CoV-2 and of the primate host cells, using a high infection titer (MOI = 5). Sixteen sampling time points ranging from 1 to 96 hours with a varying time resolution and 3 biological replicates were used in the experiment. In addition, for each infected sample, corresponding noninfected samples were employed. The raw reads were mapped to the viral and to the host reference genomes, resulting in 49,661,499 mapped reads (54,62 Gbs). The genome of the viral isolate was also sequenced and phylogenetically classified. Conclusions: This dataset can serve as a valuable resource for profiling the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome dynamics, the virus-host interactions, and the RNA base modifications.

Findings: We sequenced and assembled chromosome-level genomes of 3 leech species (bloodsucking Hirudo nipponia and Hirudinaria manillensis and nonbloodsucking Whitmania pigra). The dynamic population histories and genome-wide expression patterns of the 2 bloodsucking leech species were found to be similar. A combined analysis of the genomic and transcriptional data revealed that the bloodsucking leeches have a presumably enhanced auditory sense for prey location in relatively deep fresh water. The copy number of genes related to anticoagulation, analgesia, and anti-inflammation increased in the bloodsucking leeches, and their gene expressions responded dynamically to the bloodsucking process. Furthermore, the expanded FBN1 gene family may help in rapid body swelling of leeches after bloodsucking, and the expanded GLB3 gene family may be associated with long-term storage of prey blood in a leech’s body.

Subsequent to actual reconstruction of clonal evolution, detailed analysis and interpretation of the results are essential. Often, however, only few tumor samples per patient are available. Thus, information on clonal development and therapy effect may be incomplete. Furthermore, analysis of biallelic events—considered of high relevance with respect to disease course—can commonly only be realized by time-consuming analysis of the raw results and even raw sequencing data. Results: We developed clevRvis, an R/Bioconductor package providing an extensive set of visualization techniques for clonal evolution. In addition to common approaches for visualization, clevRvis offers a unique option for allele-aware representation: plaice plots. Biallelic events may be visualized and inspected at a glance. Analyzing 4 public datasets, we show that plaice plots help to gain new insights into tumor development and investigate hypotheses on disease progression and therapy resistance. In addition to a graphical user interface, automatic phylogeny-aware color coding of the plots, and an approach to explore alternative trees, clevRvis provides 2 algorithms for fully automatic time point interpolation and therapy effect estimation. Analyzing 2 public datasets, we show that both approaches allow for valid approximation of a tumor’s development in between measured time points. Conclusions: clevRvis represents a novel option for user-friendly analysis of clonal evolution, contributing to gaining new insights into tumor development. © The Author(s) 2023.

Currently, this and related species (American and European eels) are challenging to breed on a commercial basis. As a result, the wild stock is used for aquaculture. Moreover, climate change, habitat loss, water pollution, and altered ocean currents affect eel populations negatively. Accordingly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists Japanese eels as endangered and on its red list. Here we presented a high-quality genome assembly for Japanese eels and demonstrated that large chromosome reorganizations occurred in the events of third-round whole-genome duplications (3R-WRDs). Several chromosomal fusions and fissions have reduced the ancestral protochromosomal number of 25 to 19 in the Anguilla lineage. A phylogenetic analysis of the expanded gene families showed that the olfactory receptors (group δand ζ genes) and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels expanded significantly. Both gene families are crucial for olfaction and neurophysiology. Additional tandem and proximal duplications occurred following 3R-WGD to acquire immune-related genes for an adaptive advantage against various pathogens.

The basic chromosome number of Musa species is x = 7, 10, or 11; however, M. beccarii has a basic chromosome number of x = 9 (2n = 2x = 18), which is the same basic chromosome number of species in the sister genera Ensete and Musella. Musa beccarii is in the section Callimusa, which is sister to the section Musa. We generated a high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly of M. beccarii to better understand the evolution and diversity of genomes within the family Musaceae. Findings: The M. beccarii genome was assembled by long-read and Hi-C sequencing, and genes were annotated using both long Iso-seq and short RNA-seq reads. The size of M. beccarii was the largest among all known Musaceae assemblies (∼570 Mbp) due to the expansion of transposable elements and increased 45S ribosomal DNA sites. By synteny analysis, we detected extensive genome-wide chromosome fusions and fissions between M. beccarii and the other Musa and Ensete species, far beyond those expected from differences in chromosome number. Within Musaceae, M. beccarii showed a reduced number of terpenoid synthase genes, which are related to chemical defense, and enrichment in lipid metabolism genes linked to the physical defense of the cell wall. Furthermore, type III polyketide synthase was the most abundant biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in M. beccarii. BGCs were not conserved in Musaceae genomes. Conclusions: The genome assembly of M. beccarii is the first chromosome-scale genome assembly in the Callimusa section in Musa, which provides an important genetic resource that aids our understanding of the evolution of Musaceae genomes and enhances our knowledge of the pangenome. © The Author(s) 2023.

Several databases and tools have been created to keep track of genome sequences and variants of the virus; most notably, the GISAID platform hosts millions of complete genome sequences, and it is continuously expanding every day. A challenging task is the development of fast and accurate tools that are able to distinguish between the different SARS-CoV-2 variants and assign them to a clade. RESULTS: In this article, we leverage the frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop an original method that learns how to classify genome sequences that we implement into CouGaR-g, a tool for the clade assignment problem on SARS-CoV-2 sequences. On a testing subset of the GISAID, CouGaR-g achieved an $96.29\%$ overall accuracy, while a similar tool, Covidex, obtained a $77,12\%$ overall accuracy. As far as we know, our method is the first using deep learning and FCGR for intraspecies classification. Furthermore, by using some feature importance methods, CouGaR-g allows to identify k-mers that match SARS-CoV-2 marker variants. CONCLUSIONS: By combining FCGR and CNNs, we develop a method that achieves a better accuracy than Covidex (which is based on random forest) for clade assignment of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, also thanks to our training on a much larger dataset, with comparable running times. Our method implemented in CouGaR-g is able to detect k-mers that capture relevant biological information that distinguishes the clades, known as marker variants.

The problem is that there is much uncertainty in these drug datasets—we know the drug–drug or drug–target interactions reported in the research papers, but we cannot know if the not reported interactions are absent or yet to be discovered. This uncertainty hampers the accuracy of such bioinformatics applications. Results: We use complex network statistics tools and simulations of randomly inserted previously unaccounted interactions in drug–drug and drug–target interaction networks—built with data from DrugBank versions released over the plast decade—to investigate whether the abundance of new research data (included in the latest dataset versions) mitigates the uncertainty issue. Our results show that the drug–drug interaction networks built with the latest dataset versions become very dense and, therefore, almost impossible to analyze with conventional complex network methods. On the other hand, for the latest drug database versions, drug–target networks still include much uncertainty; however, the robustness of complex network analysis methods slightly improves. Conclusions: Our big data analysis results pinpoint future research directions to improve the quality and practicality of drug databases for bioinformatics applications: benchmarking for drug–target interaction prediction and drug–drug interaction severity standardization. © The Author(s) 2023.

This limits its use in the reading of amplicon libraries in which there are only a few mutations per variant and therefore they are easily confused with the sequencing noise. Consensus calling strategies reduce the error but sacrifice part of the throughput on reading typically 30 to 100 times each member of the library. Findings: In this work, we introduce SINGLe (SNPs In Nanopore reads of Gene Libraries), an error correction method to reduce the noise in nanopore reads of amplicons containing point variations. SINGLe exploits that in an amplicon library, all reads are very similar to a wild-type sequence from which it is possible to experimentally characterize the position-specific systematic sequencing error pattern. Then, it uses this information to reweight the confidence given to nucleotides that do not match the wild-type in individual variant reads and incorporates it on the consensus calculation. Conclusions: We tested SINGLe in a mutagenic library of the KlenTaq polymerase gene, where the true mutation rate was below the sequencing noise. We observed that contrary to other methods, SINGLe compensates for the systematic errors made by the basecallers. Consequently, SINGLe converges to the true sequence using as little as 5 reads per variant, fewer than the other available methods.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Here I propose the partial confounder test, which, for a given confounder variable, probes the null hypotheses of the model being unconfounded. Results: The test provides a strict control for type I errors and high statistical power, even for nonnormally and nonlinearly dependent predictions, often seen in machine learning.

For scRNA-seq data, variability in gene expression reflects the degree of variation in gene expression from one cell to another. Analyses that focus on cell–cell variability therefore are useful for going beyond changes based on average expression and, instead, identifying genes with homogeneous expression versus those that vary widely from cell to cell. Results: We present a novel statistical framework, scShapes, for identifying differential distributions in single-cell RNA-sequencing data using generalized linear models. Most approaches for differential gene expression detect shifts in the mean value. However, as single-cell data are driven by overdispersion and dropouts, moving beyond means and using distributions that can handle excess zeros is critical. scShapes quantifies gene-specific cell-to-cell variability by testing for differences in the expression distribution while flexibly adjusting for covariates if required. We demonstrate that scShapes identifies subtle variations that are independent of altered mean expression and detects biologically relevant genes that were not discovered through standard approaches. Conclusions: This analysis also draws attention to genes that switch distribution shapes from a unimodal distribution to a zero-inflated distribution and raises open questions about the plausible biological mechanisms that may give rise to this, such as transcriptional bursting. Overall, the results from scShapes help to expand our understanding of the role that gene expression plays in the transcriptional regulation of a specific perturbation or cellular phenotype.

However, currently available tools for data analysis require a significant time investment for training and adaptation to each laboratory’s use case, which limits productivity. Here, we present FriendlyClearMap, an integrated toolset that makes ClearMap1 and ClearMap2’s CellMap pipeline easier to use, extends its functions, and provides Docker Images from which it can be run with minimal time investment. We also provide detailed tutorials for each step of the pipeline. Findings: For more precise alignment, we add a landmark-based atlas registration to ClearMap’s functions as well as include young mouse reference atlases for developmental studies. We provide an alternative cell segmentation method besides ClearMap’s threshold-based approach: Ilastik’s Pixel Classification, importing segmentations from commercial image analysis packages and even manual annotations. Finally, we integrate BrainRender, a recently released visualization tool for advanced 3-dimensional visualization of the annotated cells. Conclusions: As a proof of principle, we use FriendlyClearMap to quantify the distribution of the 3 main GABAergic interneuron subclasses (parvalbumin+ [PV+], somatostatin+, and vasoactive intestinal peptide+) in the mouse forebrain and midbrain. For PV+ neurons, we provide an additional dataset with adolescent vs. adult PV+ neuron density, showcasing the use for developmental studies. When combined with the analysis pipeline outlined above, our toolkit improves on the state-of-the-art packages by extending their function and making them easier to deploy at scale. © The Author(s) 2023.

With the continued increase in available public small RNA sequencing datasets, there is an opportunity to more fully understand the general distribution of miRNAs at the cell level. Results: From the NCBI Sequence Read Archive, we obtained 6,054 human primary cell datasets and processed 4,184 of them through the miRge3.0 small RNA sequencing alignment software. This dataset was curated down, through shared miRNA expression patterns, to 2,077 samples from 196 unique cell types derived from 175 separate studies. Of 2,731 putative miRNAs listed in miRBase (v22.1), 2,452 (89.8%) were detected. Among reasonably expressed miRNAs, 108 were designated as cell specific/near specific, 59 as infrequent, 52 as frequent, 54 as near ubiquitous, and 50 as ubiquitous. The complexity of cellular microRNA expression estimates recapitulates tissue expression patterns and informs on the miRNA composition of plasma. Conclusions: This study represents the most complete reference, to date, of miRNA expression patterns by primary cell type.

Skeletal microbiomes harbored a diverse array of stress response genes, including dimethylsulfoniopropionate synthesis (dsyB) and metabolism (DMSP lyase).

There are many outstanding questions on the evolution of toxin arsenals, such as how venom genes originate, how venom contributes to the fitness of venomous species, and which modifications at the genomic, transcriptomic, and protein level drive their evolution. These questions have received particularly little attention outside of snakes, cone snails, spiders, and scorpions. Venom compounds have further become a source of inspiration for translational research using their diverse bioactivities for various applications. We highlight here recent advances and new strategies in modern venomics and discuss how recent technological innovations and multi-omic methods dramatically improve research on venomous animals. The study of genomes and their modifications through CRISPR and knockdown technologies will increase our understanding of how toxins evolve and which functions they have in the different ontogenetic stages during the development of venomous animals. Mass spectrometry imaging combined with spatial transcriptomics, in situ hybridization techniques, and modern computer tomography gives us further insights into the spatial distribution of toxins in the venom system and the function of the venom apparatus. All these evolutionary and biological insights contribute to more efficiently identify venom compounds, which can then be synthesized or produced in adapted expression systems to test their bioactivity. Finally, we critically discuss recent agrochemical, pharmaceutical, therapeutic, and diagnostic (so-called translational) aspects of venoms from which humans benefit. © The Author(s) 2022.

A recent surge in computational methods that aim to accurately estimate taxonomic profiles, called taxonomic profilers, has motivated community-driven efforts to create standardized benchmarking datasets and platforms, standardized taxonomic profile formats, and a benchmarking platform to assess tool performance. While this standardization is essential, there is currently a lack of tools to visualize the standardized output of the many existing taxonomic profilers. Thus, benchmarking studies rely on a single-value metrics to compare performance of tools and compare to benchmarking datasets. This is one of the major problems in analyzing metagenomic profiling data, since single metrics, such as the F1 score, fail to capture the biological differences between the datasets. Findings: Here we report the development of TAMPA (Taxonomic metagenome profiling evaluation), a robust and easy-to-use method that allows scientists to easily interpret and interact with taxonomic profiles produced by the many different taxonomic profiler methods beyond the standard metrics used by the scientific community. We demonstrate the unique ability of TAMPA to generate a novel biological hypothesis by highlighting the taxonomic differences between samples otherwise missed by commonly utilized metrics. Conclusion: In this study, we show that TAMPA can help visualize the output of taxonomic profilers, enabling biologists to effectively choose the most appropriate profiling method to use on their metagenomics data.

In this study, the venoms of 26 of sub-Saharan Africa's medically most relevant elapid and viper species were subjected to parallelized toxicovenomics analysis.

While viruses are routinely characterized using high-throughput sequencing techniques, characterizing the genetic products of recombination in next-generation sequencing data remains a challenge. Viral recombination events can be highly diverse and variable in nature, including simple duplications and deletions, or more complex events such as copy/snap-back recombination, intervirus or intersegment recombination, and insertions of host nucleic acids. Due to the variable mechanisms driving virus recombination and the different selection pressures acting on the progeny, recombination junctions rarely adhere to simple canonical sites or sequences. Furthermore, numerous different events may be present simultaneously in a viral population, yielding a complex mutational landscape. Findings: We have previously developed an algorithm called ViReMa (Virus Recombination Mapper) that bootstraps the bowtie short-read aligner to capture and annotate a wide range of recombinant species found within virus populations. Here, we have updated ViReMa to provide an “error density” function designed to accurately detect recombination events in the longer reads now routinely generated by the Illumina platforms and provide output reports for multiple types of recombinant species using standardized formats.

Differential expression of TFs and their binding affinity at putative CREs determine tissueand developmental-specific transcriptional activity. Consolidating genomic datasets can offer further insights into the accessibility of CREs, TF activity, and, thus, gene regulation. However, the integration and analysis of multimodal datasets are hampered by considerable technical challenges. While methods for highlighting differential TF activity from combined chromatin state data (e.g., chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP], ATAC, or DNase sequencing) and RNA sequencing data exist, they do not offer convenient usability, have limited support for large-scale data processing, and provide only minimal functionality for visually interpreting results. Results: We developed TF-Prioritizer, an automated pipeline that prioritizes condition-specific TFs from multimodal data and generates an interactive web report. We demonstrated its potential by identifying known TFs along with their target genes, as well as previously unreported TFs active in lactating mouse mammary glands. Additionally, we studied a variety of ENCODE datasets for cell lines K562 and MCF-7, including 12 histone modification ChIP sequencing as well as ATAC and DNase sequencing datasets, where we observe and discuss assay-specific differences. Conclusion: TF-Prioritizer accepts ATAC, DNase, or ChIP sequencing and RNA sequencing data as input and identifies TFs with differential activity, thus offering an understanding of genome-wide gene regulation, potential pathogenesis, and therapeutic targets in biomedical research.  © The Author(s) 2023.","Animals; Binding Sites; Deoxyribonucleases; Female; Indonesia; Lactation; Mice; Transcription Factors; deoxyribonuclease; transcription factor; animal; binding site; female; genetics; Indonesia; lactation; metabolism; mouse","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158051555"

Although a complete absence of recombination is rare, it has been reported for some species, among them 2 extremotolerant black yeasts from Dothideomycetes: Hortaea werneckii and Aureobasidium melanogenum. Therefore, the presence of diploid strains in these species cannot be explained as the product of conventional sexual reproduction. Results: Genome sequencing revealed that the ratio of diploid to haploid strains in both H. werneckii and A. melanogenum is about 2:1. Linkage disequilibrium between pairs of polymorphic loci and a high degree of concordance between the phylogenies of different genomic regions confirmed that both species are clonal. Heterozygosity of diploid strains is high, with several hybridizing genome pairs reaching the intergenomic distances typically seen between different fungal species. The origin of diploid strains collected worldwide can be traced to a handful of hybridization events that produced diploids, which were stable over long periods of time and distributed over large geographic areas. Conclusions: Our results, based on the genomes of over 100 strains of 2 black yeasts, show that although they are clonal, they occasionally form stable and highly heterozygous diploid intraspecific hybrids. The mechanism of these apparently rare hybridization events, which are not followed by meiosis or haploidization, remains unknown. Both extremotolerant yeasts, H. werneckii and even more so A. melanogenum, a close relative of the intensely recombining and biotechnologically relevant Aureobasidium pullulans, provide an attractive model for studying the role of clonality and ploidy in extremotolerant fungi.  © 2022 The Author(s).

The MesAur1.0 genome assembly was generated in 2013 using whole-genome shotgun sequencing with short-read sequence data. Current more advanced sequencing technologies and assembly methods now permit the generation of near-complete genome assemblies with higher quality and greater continuity. FINDINGS: Here, we report an improved assembly of the M. auratus genome (BCM_Maur_2.0) using Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing to produce a chromosome-scale assembly. The total length of the new assembly is 2.46 Gb, similar to the 2.50-Gb length of a previous assembly of this genome, MesAur1.0. BCM_Maur_2.0 exhibits significantly improved continuity, with a scaffold N50 that is 6.7 times greater than MesAur1.0. Furthermore, 21,616 protein-coding genes and 10,459 noncoding genes are annotated in BCM_Maur_2.0 compared to 20,495 protein-coding genes and 4,168 noncoding genes in MesAur1.0. This new assembly also improves the unresolved regions as measured by nucleotide ambiguities, where ∼17.11% of bases in MesAur1.0 were unresolved compared to BCM_Maur_2.0, in which the number of unresolved bases is reduced to 3.00%. CONCLUSIONS: Access to a more complete reference genome with improved accuracy and continuity will facilitate more detailed, comprehensive, and meaningful research results for a wide variety of future studies using Syrian hamsters as models. © The Author(s) 2022.

The relative inaccessibility of live human cortical neurons for experimental manipulation has made it difficult to determine the unique features of how human cortical neurons differ from their counterparts in other species. Findings: We present a curated repository of whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from surgically resected human cortical tissue, encompassing 118 neurons from 35 individuals (age range, 21-59 years; 17 male, 18 female). Recorded human cortical neurons derive from layers 2 and 3 (L2&3), deep layer 3 (L3c), or layer 5 (L5) and are annotated with a rich set of subject and experimental metadata. For comparison, we also provide a limited set of comparable recordings from 21-day-old mice (11 cells from 5 mice). All electrophysiological recordings are provided in the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format and are available for further analysis via the Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration online repository. The associated data conversion code is made publicly available and can help others in converting electrophysiology datasets to the open NWB standard for general reuse.

We hypothesize that a cancer with an activated druggable cancer-specific pathway (DCSP) is more likely to respond to the relevant drug. Here we develop and validate a systematic method to search for such DCSPs, by (i) introducing a pathway activation score (PAS) that integrates cancer-specific driver mutations and gene expression profile and drug-specific gene targets, (ii) applying the method to identify DCSPs from pan-cancer datasets, and (iii) analyzing the correlation between PAS and the response to relevant drugs. In total, 4,794 DCSPs from 23 different cancers have been discovered in the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Supporting the hypothesis, for the DCSPs in acute myeloid leukemia, cancers with higher PASs are shown to have stronger drug response, and this is validated in the BeatAML cohort.

However, working with health data is challenging, requiring careful preparation in order to support meaningful interpretation and robust results. Ontologies encapsulate relationships between variables that can enrich the semantic content of health datasets to enhance interpretability and inform downstream analyses. Findings: We developed an R package for electronic health data preparation, “eHDPrep,” demonstrated upon a multimodal colorectal cancer dataset (661 patients, 155 variables; Colo-661); a further demonstrator is taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas (459 patients, 94 variables; TCGA-COAD). eHDPrep offers user-friendly methods for quality control, including internal consistency checking and redundancy removal with information-theoretic variable merging. Semantic enrichment functionality is provided, enabling generation of new informative “meta-variables” according to ontological common ancestry between variables, demonstrated with SNOMED CT and the Gene Ontology in the current study. eHDPrep also facilitates numerical encoding, variable extraction from free text, completeness analysis, and user review of modifications to the dataset.

However, analysis of such data encounters difficulties due to disease heterogeneity, further exacerbated by human biological complexity and genomic variability. The specific profile of cancer as a disease (or, more realistically, a set of diseases) urges the development of approaches that maximize the effect while minimizing the dosage of drugs. Now is the time to redefine the approach to drug discovery, bringing an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered informational view that integrates the relevant scientific fields and explores new territories. Results: Here, we show SYNPRED, an interdisciplinary approach that leverages specifically designed ensembles of AI algorithms, as well as links omics and biophysical traits to predict anticancer drug synergy. It uses 5 reference models (Bliss, Highest Single Agent, Loewe, Zero Interaction Potency, and Combination Sensitivity Score), which, coupled with AI algorithms, allowed us to attain the ones with the best predictive performance and pinpoint the most appropriate reference model for synergy prediction, often overlooked in similar studies. By using an independent test set, SYNPRED exhibits state-of-the-art performance metrics either in the classification (accuracy, 0.85; precision, 0.91; recall, 0.90; area under the receiver operating characteristic, 0.80; and F1-score, 0.91) or in the regression models, mainly when using the Combination Sensitivity Score synergy reference model (root mean square error, 11.07; mean squared error, 122.61; Pearson, 0.86; mean absolute error, 7.43; Spearman, 0.87). Moreover, data interpretability was achieved by deploying the most current and robust feature importance approaches. A simple web-based application was constructed, allowing easy access by nonexpert researchers. Conclusions: The performance of SYNPRED rivals that of the existing methods that tackle the same problem, yielding unbiased results trained with one of the most comprehensive datasets available (NCI ALMANAC). The leveraging of different reference models allowed deeper insights into which of them can be more appropriately used for synergy prediction. The Combination Sensitivity Score clearly stood out with improved performance among the full scope of surveyed approaches and synergy reference models. Furthermore, SYNPRED takes a particular focus on data interpretability, which has been in the spotlight lately when using the most advanced AI techniques.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Here, we conducted analyses on large-scale data relating to evolutionary gene expression, sequence composition, and network properties to elucidate factors associated with the stimulation of human genes in response to IFN-α. Results: We find that ISGs are less evolutionary conserved than genes that are not significantly stimulated in IFN experiments (non-ISGs). ISGs show obvious depletion of GC content in the coding region. This influences the representation of some compositions following the translation process. IFN-repressed human genes (IRGs), downregulated genes in IFN experiments, can have similar properties to the ISGs. Additionally, we design a machine learning framework integrating the support vector machine and novel feature selection algorithm that achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7455 for ISG prediction. Its application in other IFN systems suggests the similarity between the ISGs triggered by type I and III IFNs. Conclusions: ISGs have some unique properties that make them different from the non-ISGs. The representation of some properties has a strong correlation with gene expression following IFN-α stimulation, which can be used as a predictive feature in machine learning. Our model predicts several genes as putative ISGs that so far have shown no significant differential expression when stimulated with IFN-α in the cell/tissue types in the available databases.

Conclusions: These examples demonstrate how contrast subgraphs can provide new insight in functional genomics by extracting the gene/protein modules whose connectivity is most altered between 2 conditions or experimental techniques. © The Author(s) 2023.

So far, MPM patients have benefited marginally from the genomics medicine revolution due to the limited size or breadth of existing molecular studies. In the context of the MESOMICS project, we have performed the most comprehensive molecular characterization of MPM to date, with the underlying dataset made of the largest whole-genome sequencing series yet reported, together with transcriptome sequencing and methylation arrays for 120 MPM patients. Results: We first provide comprehensive quality controls for all samples, of both raw and processed data. Due to the difficulty in collecting specimens from such rare tumors, a part of the cohort does not include matched normal material. We provide a detailed analysis of data processing of these tumor-only samples, showing that all somatic alteration calls match very stringent criteria of precision and recall. Finally, integrating our data with previously published multiomic MPM datasets (n = 374 in total), we provide an extensive molecular phenotype map of MPM based on the multitask theory. The generated map can be interactively explored and interrogated on the UCSC TumorMap portal (https://tumormap.ucsc.edu/?p=RCG_MESOMICS/MPM_Archetypes). Conclusions: This new high-quality MPM multiomics dataset, together with the state-of-art bioinformatics and interactive visualization tools we provide, will support the development of precision medicine in MPM that is particularly challenging to implement in rare cancers due to limited molecular studies. © World Health Organization, [2023].

Meta-analysis of available DNA methylation datasets requires development of a specific workflow for joint data processing. Results: We propose a comprehensive approach of combined DNA methylation datasets to classify controls and patients. The solution includes data harmonization, construction of machine learning classification models, dimensionality reduction of models, imputation of missing values, and explanation of model predictions by explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms. We show that harmonization can improve classification accuracy by up to 20% when preprocessing methods of the training and test datasets are different. The best accuracy results were obtained with tree ensembles, reaching above 95% for Parkinson's disease. Dimensionality reduction can substantially decrease the number of features, without detriment to the classification accuracy. The best imputation methods achieve almost the same classification accuracy for data with missing values as for the original data. XAI approaches have allowed us to explain model predictions from both populational and individual perspectives. Conclusions: We propose a methodologically valid and comprehensive approach to the classification of healthy individuals and patients with various diseases based on whole-blood DNA methylation data using Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia as examples. The proposed algorithm works better for the former pathology, characterized by a complex set of symptoms. It allows to solve data harmonization problems for meta-analysis of many different datasets, impute missing values, and build classification models of small dimensionality.  © 2022 The Author(s).

However, the genetic basis of this selection response is poorly understood. To better address this, we employed the Pekin duck Z2 pure line, in which the breast muscle weight was increased nearly 3-fold after 10 generations of breeding. We de novo assembled a high-quality reference genome of a female Pekin duck of this line (GCA_003850225.1) and identified 8.60 million genetic variants in 119 individuals among 10 generations of the breeding population. Results: We identified 53 selected regions between the first and tenth generations, and 93.8% of the identified variations were enriched in regulatory and noncoding regions. Integrating the selection signatures and genome-wide association approach, we found that 2 regions covering 0.36 Mb containing UTP25 and FBRSL1 were most likely to contribute to breast muscle weight improvement. The major allele frequencies of these 2 loci increased gradually with each generation following the same trend. Additionally, we found that a copy number variation region containing the entire EXOC4 gene could explain 1.9% of the variance in breast muscle weight, indicating that the nervous system may play a role in economic trait improvement. Conclusions: Our study not only provides insights into genomic dynamics under intense artificial selection but also provides resources for genomics-enabled improvements in duck breeding. © The Author(s) 2023.

The species is endemic to Aldabra Atoll in Seychelles and is listed as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List (v2.3) due to its limited distribution and threats posed by climate change. Genomic resources for A. gigantea are lacking, hampering conservation efforts for both wild and ex situ populations. A high-quality genome would also open avenues to investigate the genetic basis of the species' exceptionally long life span. Findings: We produced the first chromosome-level de novo genome assembly of A. gigantea using PacBio High-Fidelity sequencing and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture. We produced a 2.37-Gbp assembly with a scaffold N50 of 148.6 Mbp and a resolution into 26 chromosomes. RNA sequencing-assisted gene model prediction identified 23,953 protein-coding genes and 1.1 Gbp of repetitive sequences. Synteny analyses among turtle genomes revealed high levels of chromosomal collinearity even among distantly related taxa. To assess the utility of the high-quality assembly for species conservation, we performed a low-coverage resequencing of 30 individuals from wild populations and two zoo individuals. Our genome-wide population structure analyses detected genetic population structure in the wild and identified the most likely origin of the zoo-housed individuals. We further identified putatively deleterious mutations to be monitored. Conclusions: We establish a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome for A. gigantea and one of the most complete turtle genomes available. We show that low-coverage whole-genome resequencing, for which alignment to the reference genome is a necessity, is a powerful tool to assess the population structure of the wild population and reveal the geographic origins of ex situ individuals relevant for genetic diversity management and rewilding efforts. © The Author(s) 2022.

However, due to the limitations of short-read sequencing and assembly technologies, most of these MAGs are far from complete, are of lower quality, and include contaminant reads. Results: We generated 332 Gb of high-fidelity (HiFi) long reads from the 5 chicken intestinal compartments and assembled 461 and 337 microbial genomes, of which 53% and 55% are circular, at the species and strain levels, respectively. For the assembled microbial genomes, approximately 95% were regarded as complete according to the ""RNA complete""criteria, which requires at least 1 full-length ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operon encoding all 3 types of rRNA (16S, 23S, and 5S) and at least 18 copies of full-length transfer RNA genes. In comparison with the short-read-derived chicken MAGs, 384 (83% of 461) and 89 (26% of 337) strain-level and species-level genomes in this study are novel, with no matches to previously reported sequences. At the gene level, one-Third of the 2.5 million genes in the HiFi-derived gene catalog are novel and cannot be matched to the short-read-derived gene catalog. Moreover, the HiFi-derived genomes have much higher continuity and completeness, as well as lower contamination; the HiFi-derived gene catalog has a much higher ratio of complete gene structures. The dominant phylum in our HiFi-Assembled genomes was Firmicutes (82.5%), and the foregut was highly enriched in 5 genera: Ligilactobacillus, Limosilactobacillus, Lactobacillus, Weissella, and Enterococcus, all of which belong to the order Lactobacillales. Using GTDB-Tk, all 337 species-level genomes were successfully classified at the order level; however, 2, 35, and 189 genomes could not be classified into any known family, genus, and species, respectively. Among these incompletely classified genomes, 9 and 49 may belong to novel genera and species, respectively, because their 16S rRNA genes have identities lower than 95% and 97% to any known 16S rRNA genes. Conclusions: HiFi sequencing not only produced metagenome assemblies and gene structures with markedly improved quality but also recovered a substantial portion of novel genomes and genes that were missed in previous short-read-based metagenome studies. The novel genomes and species obtained in this study will facilitate gut microbiome and host-microbiota interaction studies, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of poultry resources. © 2022 The Author(s).

Machine learning methods have emerged recently as a powerful tool to solve this problem. State-of-the-art approaches allow prediction of transcriptional and epigenetic effects caused by noncoding mutations. However, these approaches require specific experimental data for training and cannot generalize across cell types where required features were not experimentally measured. We show here that available epigenetic characteristics of human cell types are extremely sparse, limiting those approaches that rely on specific epigenetic input. We propose a new neural network architecture, DeepCT, which can learn complex interconnections of epigenetic features and infer unmeasured data from any available input. Furthermore, we show that DeepCT can learn cell type–specific properties, build biologically meaningful vector representations of cell types, and utilize these representations to generate cell type–specific predictions of the effects of noncoding variations in the human genome. © The Author(s) 2023.

The Australian grass Bothriochloa decipiens belongs to the BCD clade, a group with a complex history of hybridization and polyploid. This is the first genome assembly and annotation of a species that belongs to this fascinating yet complex group. Findings: Using Illumina short reads, 10X Genomics linked reads, and Hi-C sequencing data, we assembled a highly contiguous genome of B. decipiens, with a total length of 1,218.22 Mb and scaffold N50 of 42.637 Mb. Comparative analysis revealed that the species experienced a relatively recent whole-genome duplication. We clustered the 20 major scaffolds, representing the 20 chromosomes, into the 2 subgenomes of the parental species using unique repeat signatures. We found evidence of biased fractionation and differences in the activity of transposable elements between the subgenomes prior to hybridization. Duplicates were enriched for genes involved in transcription and response to external stimuli, supporting a biased retention of duplicated genes following whole-genome duplication. Conclusions: Our results support the hypotheses of a biased retention of duplicated genes following polyploidy and point to differences in repeat activity associated with subgenome dominance. B. decipiens is a widespread species with the ability to establish across many soil types, making it a prime candidate for climate change– resilient ecological restoration of Australian grasslands.

While there has been general enthusiasm for and work toward Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data for open science, only more recently have these data-centric principles been extended into dimensions important to people and place—notably, the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance, which affect collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility, and ethics. The FAIR Island project seeks to translate these ideals into practice, leveraging the institutional infrastructure provided by scientific field stations. Starting with field stations in French Polynesia as key use cases that are exceptionally well connected to international research networks, FAIR Island builds interoperability between different components of critical research infrastructure, helping connect these to societal benefit areas. The goal is not only to increase reuse of scientific data and the awareness of work happening at the field stations but more generally to accelerate place-based research for sustainable development. FAIR Island works reflexively, aiming to scale horizontally through networks of field stations and to serve as a model for other sites of intensive long-term scientific study. © The Author(s) 2023.

Despite the recent boom in genomes for wildlife species, immune genes are poorly annotated in nonmodel species owing to their high level of polymorphism and complex genomic organisation. Our research over the past decade and a half on Tasmanian devils and koalas highlights the importance of genomics and accurate immune annotations to investigate disease in wildlife. Given this, we have increasingly been asked the minimum levels of genome quality required to effectively annotate immune genes in order to study immunogenetic diversity. Here we set out to answer this question by manually annotating immune genes in 5 marsupial genomes and 1 monotreme genome to determine the impact of sequencing data type, assembly quality, and automated annotation on accurate immune annotation. Results: Genome quality is directly linked to our ability to annotate complex immune gene families, with long reads and scaffolding technologies required to reassemble immune gene clusters and elucidate evolution, organisation, and true gene content of the immune repertoire. Draft-quality genomes generated from short reads with HiC or 10× Chromium linked reads were unable to achieve this. Despite mammalian BUSCOv5 scores of up to 94.1% amongst the 6 genomes, automated annotation pipelines incorrectly annotated up to 59% of manually annotated immune genes regardless of assembly quality or method of automated annotation. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that long reads and scaffolding technologies, alongside manual annotation, are required to accurately study the immune gene repertoire of wildlife species.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Findings: Research using an animal model of obsessive-compulsive disorder employed a standardized paradigm where the behavior of rats in a large open field was video recorded for 55 minutes on each test. From 43 experiments, there are 19,976 such trials that amount to over 2 years of continuous recording. In addition to videos, there are 2 video-derived raw data objects: XY locomotion coordinates and plots of animal trajectory. To motivate future use, the 3 raw data objects are annotated with a general schema - one that abstracts the data records from their particular experiment while providing, at the same time, a detailed list of independent variables bearing on behavioral performance. The raw data objects are deposited as 43 datasets but constitute, functionally, a library containing 1 large dataset. Conclusions: Size and annotation schema give the library high reuse potential: in applications using machine learning techniques, statistical evaluation of subtle factors, simulation of new experiments, or as educational resource. Ultimately, the library can serve both as the seed and as the test bed to create a machine-searchable virtual library of linked open datasets for behavioral performance in defined conditions.  © 2022 The Author(s).

However, genetic studies on this species are limited because of the lack of its reference genome. Findings: We sequenced and assembled the Capparis spinosa var. herbacea (Willd.) genome using data obtained from the combination of PacBio circular consensus sequencing and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture. The final genome assembly was approximately 274.53 Mb (contig N50 length of 9.36 Mb, scaffold N50 of 15.15 Mb), 99.23% of which was assigned to 21 chromosomes. In the whole-genome sequence, tandem repeats accounted for 19.28%, and transposable element sequences accounted for 43.98%. The proportion of tandem repeats in the C. spinosa var. herbacea genome was much higher than the average of 8.55% in plant genomes. A total of 21,577 protein-coding genes were predicted, with 98.82% being functionally annotated. The result of species divergence times showed that C. spinosa var. herbacea and Tarenaya hassleriana separated from a common ancestor 43.31 million years ago. Conclusions: This study reported a high-quality reference genome assembly and genome features for the Capparaceae family. The assembled C. spinosa var. herbacea genome might provide a system for studying the diversity, speciation, and evolution of this family and serve as an important resource for understanding the mechanism of drought and high-temperature resistance.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Several databases and tools have been created to keep track of genome sequences and variants of the virus; most notably, the GISAID platform hosts millions of complete genome sequences, and it is continuously expanding every day. A challenging task is the development of fast and accurate tools that are able to distinguish between the different SARS-CoV-2 variants and assign them to a clade. Results: In this article, we leverage the frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop an original method that learns how to classify genome sequences that we implement into CouGaR-g, a tool for the clade assignment problem on SARS-CoV-2 sequences. On a testing subset of the GISAID, CouGaR-g achieved an 96.29% overall accuracy, while a similar tool, Covidex, obtained a 77, 12% overall accuracy. As far as we know, our method is the first using deep learning and FCGR for intraspecies classification. Furthermore, by using some feature importance methods, CouGaR-g allows to identify k-mers that match SARS-CoV-2 marker variants. Conclusions: By combining FCGR and CNNs, we develop a method that achieves a better accuracy than Covidex (which is based on random forest) for clade assignment of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, also thanks to our training on a much larger dataset, with comparable running times. Our method implemented in CouGaR-g is able to detect k-mers that capture relevant biological information that distinguishes the clades, known as marker variants. © The Author(s) 2022.

By seamlessly combining BLAST as an entry point together with interactive data analysis features such as principal component analysis in one graphical user interface, DivBrowse provides a novel and unique set of exploratory data analysis capabilities for genomic biodiversity datasets. The capability to integrate DivBrowse into existing web applications supports interoperability between different web applications. Built-in interactive computation of principal component analysis allows users to perform ad hoc analysis of the population structure based on specific genetic elements such as genes and exons. Data interoperability is supported by the ability to export genomic diversity data in VCF and General Feature Format 3 files. Conclusion: DivBrowse offers a novel approach for interactive visualization and analysis of genomic diversity data and optionally also gene annotation data by including features like interactive calculation of variant frequencies and principal component analysis.

However, sequencing platform-specific challenges, including high base-call error rate, nonuniform read lengths, and the presence of chimeric artifacts, necessitate specifically designed analytical algorithms. The use of simulated datasets with characteristics that are true to the sequencing platform under evaluation is a cost-effective way to assess the performance of bioinformatics tools with the ground truth in a controlled environment. Results: Here, we present Meta-NanoSim, a fast and versatile utility that characterizes and simulates the unique properties of nanopore metagenomic reads. It improves upon state-of-the-art methods on microbial abundance estimation through a base-level quantification algorithm. Meta-NanoSim can simulate complex microbial communities composed of both linear and circular genomes and can stream reference genomes from online servers directly. Simulated datasets showed high congruence with experimental data in terms of read length, error profiles, and abundance levels. We demonstrate that Meta-NanoSim simulated data can facilitate the development of metagenomic algorithms and guide experimental design through a metagenome assembly benchmarking task. Conclusions: The Meta-NanoSim characterization module investigates read features, including chimeric information and abundance levels, while the simulation module simulates large and complex multisample microbial communities with different abundance profiles.

A potential solution to this problem is presented by ever more sophisticated computational protein modeling approaches. While often powerful on their own, most methods have strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, it benefits researchers to examine models from various model providers and perform comparative analysis to identify what models can best address their specific use cases. To make data from a large array of model providers more easily accessible to the broader scientific community, we established 3D-Beacons, a collaborative initiative to create a federated network with unified data access mechanisms.

It allows recovering draft genomes from a pool of mixed raw reads, yielding longer sequences that offer contextual information and provide a more complete picture of the microbial community. Findings: To better compare de novo assemblers for metagenomic analysis, LMAS (Last Metagenomic Assembler Standing) was developed as a flexible platform allowing users to evaluate assembler performance given known standard communities. Overall, in our test datasets, k-mer De Bruijn graph assemblers outperformed the alternative approaches but came with a greater computational cost. Furthermore, assemblers branded as metagenomic specific did not consistently outperform other genomic assemblers in metagenomic samples. Some assemblers still in use, such as ABySS, MetaHipmer2, minia, and VelvetOptimiser, perform relatively poorly and should be used with caution when assembling complex samples. Meaningful strain resolution at the single-nucleotide polymorphism level was not achieved, even by the best assemblers tested. Conclusions: The choice of a de novo assembler depends on the computational resources available, the replicon of interest, and the major goals of the analysis. No single assembler appeared an ideal choice for short-read metagenomic prokaryote replicon assembly, each showing specific strengths. The choice of metagenomic assembler should be guided by user requirements and characteristics of the sample of interest, and LMAS provides an interactive evaluation platform for this purpose.

Administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy may cause increased density of tumor-infiltrating T cells, which has been associated with improved response to ICI. This study aimed to quantify and characterize T-cell infiltration in CLM using T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing. Eighty-five resected CLMs from patients included in the Oslo CoMet study were subjected to TCR repertoire sequencing. Thirty-five and 15 patients had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) within a short or long interval, respectively, prior to resection, while 35 patients had not been exposed to NACT. T-cell fractions were calculated, repertoire clonality was analyzed based on Hill evenness curves, and TCR sequence convergence was assessed using network analysis. Results: Increased T-cell fractions (10.6% vs. 6.3%) were detected in CLMs exposed to NACT within a short interval prior to resection, while modestly increased clonality was observed in NACT-exposed tumors independently of the timing of NACT administration and surgery. While private clones made up >90% of detected clones, network connectivity analysis revealed that public clones contributed the majority of TCR sequence convergence. Conclusions: TCR repertoire sequencing can be used to quantify T-cell infiltration and clonality in clinical samples. This study provides evidence to support chemotherapy-driven T-cell clonal expansion in CLM in a clinical context. © The Author(s) 2023.

Results: To delineate the global chromatin landscape and understand the molecular dynamics during this period, a single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) was applied to in vitro cultured cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis, hereafter referred to as monkey) embryos to investigate the chromatin status. First, we delineated the cis-regulatory interactions and identified the regulatory networks and critical transcription factors involved in the epiblast (EPI), hypoblast, and trophectoderm/trophoblast (TE) lineage specification. Second, we observed that the chromatin opening of some genome regions preceded the gene expression during EPI and trophoblast specification. Third, we identified the opposing roles of FGF and BMP signaling in pluripotency regulation during EPI specification. Finally, we revealed the similarity between EPI and TE in gene expression profiles and demonstrated that PATZ1 and NR2F2 were involved in EPI and trophoblast specification during monkey post-implantation development.

Reusing and connecting these data can uncover hidden insights and lead to new concepts. Efficient reuse of these datasets is strongly promoted when they are interlinked with a sufficient amount of machine-actionable metadata. While the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guiding principles have been accepted by all stakeholders, in practice, there are only a limited number of easy-to-adopt implementations available that fulfill the needs of data producers. Findings: We developed the FAIR Data Station, a lightweight application written in Java, that aims to support researchers in managing research metadata according to the FAIR principles. It implements the ISA metadata framework and uses minimal information metadata standards to capture experiment metadata. The FAIR Data Station consists of 3 modules. Based on the minimal information model(s) selected by the user, the “form generation module” creates a metadata template Excel workbook with a header row of machine-actionable attribute names. The Excel workbook is subsequently used by the data producer(s) as a familiar environment for sample metadata registration. At any point during this process, the format of the recorded values can be checked using the “validation module.” Finally, the “resource module” can be used to convert the set of metadata recorded in the Excel workbook in RDF format, enabling (cross-project) (meta)data searches and, for publishing of sequence data, in an European Nucleotide Archive–compatible XML metadata file. Conclusions: Turning FAIR into reality requires the availability of easy-to-adopt data FAIRification workflows that are also of direct use for data producers. As such, the FAIR Data Station provides, in addition to the means to correctly FAIRify (omics) data, the means to build searchable metadata databases of similar projects and can assist in ENA metadata submission of sequence data.

Here we describe the whole-genome sequencing and assembly of 3 closely related species from the butterfly genus Morpho: Morpho achilles (Linnaeus, 1758), Morpho helenor (Cramer, 1776), and Morpho deidamia (Höbner, 1819). These large blue butterflies are emblematic species of the Amazonian rainforest. They live in sympatry in a wide range of their geographical distribution and display parallel diversification of dorsal wing color pattern, suggesting local mimicry. By sequencing, assembling, and annotating their genomes, we aim at uncovering prezygotic barriers preventing gene flow between these sympatric species. We found a genome size of 480 Mb for the 3 species and a chromosomal number ranging from 2n = 54 for M. deidamia to 2n = 56 for M. achilles and M. helenor. We also detected inversions on the sex chromosome Z that were differentially fixed between species, suggesting that chromosomal rearrangements may contribute to their reproductive isolation. The annotation of their genomes allowed us to recover in each species at least 12,000 protein-coding genes and to discover duplications of genes potentially involved in prezygotic isolation like genes controlling color discrimination (L-opsin). Altogether, the assembly and the annotation of these 3 new reference genomes open new research avenues into the genomic architecture of speciation and reinforcement in sympatry, establishing Morpho butterflies as a new eco-evolutionary model. © The Author(s) 2023.

In the past decade, with the increasing accessibility of high-throughput sequencing technologies, different methods have been developed to identify miRNAs, most of which rely on preexisting reference genomes. However, when a reference genome is absent or is not of high quality, such identification becomes more difficult. In this context, we developed BrumiR, an algorithm that is able to discover miRNAs directly and exclusively from small RNA (sRNA) sequencing (sRNA-seq) data. We benchmarked BrumiR with datasets encompassing animal and plant species using real and simulated sRNA-seq experiments. The results demonstrate that BrumiR reaches the highest recall for miRNA discovery, while at the same time being much faster and more efficient than the state-of-the-art tools evaluated. The latter allows BrumiR to analyze a large number of sRNA-seq experiments, from plants or animal species. Moreover, BrumiR detects additional information regarding other expressed sequences (sRNAs, isomiRs, etc.), thus maximizing the biological insight gained from sRNA-seq experiments. Additionally, when a reference genome is available, BrumiR provides a new mapping tool (BrumiR2reference) that performs an a posteriori exhaustive search to identify the precursor sequences. Finally, we also provide a machine learning classifier based on a random forest model that evaluates the sequence-derived features to further refine the prediction obtained from the BrumiR-core.

When analyzing MSI data, it is essential to delineate regions of interest (ROIs) that correspond to tissue areas of different anatomical or pathological labels. Spatial segmentation, obtained by clustering MSI pixels according to their mass spectral similarities, is a popular approach to automate ROI definition. However, how to select the number of clusters (#Clusters), which determines the granularity of segmentation, remains to be resolved, and an inappropriate #Clusters may lead to ROIs not biologically real. Here we report a multimodal fusion strategy to enable an objective and trustworthy selection of #Clusters by utilizing additional information from corresponding histology images. A deep learning–based algorithm is proposed to extract “histomorphological feature spectra” across an entire hematoxylin and eosin image. Clustering is then similarly performed to produce histology segmentation. Since ROIs originating from instrumental noise or artifacts would not be reproduced cross-modally, the consistency between histology and MSI segmentation becomes an effective measure of the biological validity of the results. So, #Clusters that maximize the consistency is deemed as most probable. We validated our strategy on mouse kidney and renal tumor specimens by producing multimodally corroborated ROIs that agreed excellently with ground truths.

Findings: We have developed xAtlas, a single-sample variant caller for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels) in NGS data. xAtlas features rapid runtimes, support for CRAM and gVCF file formats, and retraining capabilities. xAtlas reports SNVs with 99.11% recall and 98.43% precision across a reference HG002 sample at 60× whole-genome coverage in less than 2 CPU hours. Applying xAtlas to 3,202 samples at 30× whole-genome coverage from the 1000 Genomes Project achieves an average runtime of 1.7 hours per sample and a clear separation of the individual populations in principal component analysis across called SNVs.

However, the discovery of novel bioactive scaffolds is often hampered by the chemical complexity of the biological matrices they are found in. Large natural extract collections are thus extremely valuable for their chemical novelty potential but also complicated to exploit in the frame of drug-discovery projects. In the end, it is the pure chemical substances that are desired for structural determination purposes and bioactivity evaluation. Researchers interested in the exploration of large and chemodiverse extract collections should thus establish strategies aiming to efficiently tackle such chemical complexity and access these structures. Establishing carefully crafted digital layers documenting the spectral and chemical complexity as well as bioactivity results of natural extracts collections can help prioritize time-consuming but mandatory isolation efforts. In this note, we report the results of our initial exploration of a collection of 1,600 plant extracts in the frame of a drug-discovery effort. After describing the taxonomic coverage of this collection, we present the results of its liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometric profiling and the exploitation of these profiles using computational solutions. The resulting annotated mass spectral dataset and associated chemical and taxonomic metadata are made available to the community, and data reuse cases are proposed. We are currently continuing our exploration of this plant extract collection for drug-discovery purposes (notably looking for novel antitrypanosomatids, anti-infective and prometabolic compounds) and ecometabolomics insights. We believe that such a dataset can be exploited and reused by researchers interested in computational natural products exploration. © The Author(s) 2023.

Huge gaps exist in the information related to these vectors, creating an essential need for campaigns to mobilise and share data. The publication of data papers is an effective tool for overcoming this challenge. These peer-reviewed articles provide scholarly credit for researchers whose vital work of assembling and publishing well-described, properly-formatted datasets often fails to receive appropriate recognition. To address this, GigaScience's sister journal GigaByte partnered with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to publish a series of data papers, with support from the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), hosted by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

These magnificent ecosystems are under existential threat from anthropogenic climate change. Whereas extensive ecological and physiological studies have addressed coral response to environmental stress, high-quality reference genome data are lacking for many of these species. The latter issue hinders efforts to understand the genetic basis of stress resistance and to design informed coral conservation strategies. Results: We report genome assemblies from 4 key Hawaiian coral species, Montipora capitata, Pocillopora acuta, Pocillopora meandrina, and Porites compressa. These species, or members of these genera, are distributed worldwide and therefore of broad scientific and ecological importance. For M. capitata, an initial assembly was generated from short-read Illumina and long-read PacBio data, which was then scaffolded into 14 putative chromosomes using Omni-C sequencing. For P. acuta, P. meandrina, and P. compressa, high-quality assemblies were generated using short-read Illumina and long-read PacBio data. The P. acuta assembly is from a triploid individual, making it the first reference genome of a nondiploid coral animal. Conclusions: These assemblies are significant improvements over available data and provide invaluable resources for supporting multiomics studies into coral biology, not just in Hawai'i but also in other regions, where related species exist. The P. acuta assembly provides a platform for studying polyploidy in corals and its role in genome evolution and stress adaptation in these organisms.  © 2022 The Author(s).

However, the presence in sequenced organisms of certain genomic features such as high heterozygosity, polyploidy, aneuploidy, heterokaryosis, or extreme compositional biases can challenge current standard assembly procedures and result in highly fragmented assemblies. Hence, we hypothesized that genome databases must contain a nonnegligible fraction of low-quality assemblies that result from such type of intrinsic genomic factors. Findings: Here we present Karyon, a Python-based toolkit that uses raw sequencing data and de novo genome assembly to assess several parameters and generate informative plots to assist in the identification of nonchanonical genomic traits. Karyon includes automated de novo genome assembly and variant calling pipelines. We tested Karyon by diagnosing 35 highly fragmented publicly available assemblies from 19 different Mucorales (Fungi) species. Conclusions: Our results show that 10 (28.57%) of the assemblies presented signs of unusual genomic configurations, suggesting that these are common, at least for some lineages within the Fungi.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Each of these sgmRNAs has a unique 5′ sequence, the leader-transcriptional regulatory sequence gene junction (leader-TRS junction), that can be identified using sequencing. High-resolution sequencing has been used to investigate the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the host response in cell culture and animal models and from clinical samples. LeTRS, a bioinformatics tool, was developed to identify leader-TRS junctions and can be used as a proxy to quantify sgmRNAs for understanding virus biology. LeTRS is readily adaptable for other coronaviruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus or a future newly discovered coronavirus. LeTRS was tested on published data sets and novel clinical samples from patients and longitudinal samples from animal models with coronavirus disease 2019. LeTRS identified known leader-TRS junctions and identified putative novel sgmRNAs that were common across different mammalian species. This may be indicative of an evolutionary mechanism where plasticity in transcription generates novel open reading frames, which can then subject to selection pressure. The data indicated multiphasic abundance of sgmRNAs in two different animal models. This recapitulates the relative sgmRNA abundance observed in cells at early points in infection but not at late points. This pattern is reflected in some human nasopharyngeal samples and therefore has implications for transmission models and nucleic acid-based diagnostics.

In the face of the current pandemic, PHA4GE has identified a need for a fit-for-purpose, open-source SARS-CoV-2 contextual data standard. Results: As such, we have developed a SARS-CoV-2 contextual data specification package based on harmonizable, publicly available community standards. The specification can be implemented via a collection template, as well as an array of protocols and tools to support both the harmonization and submission of sequence data and contextual information to public biorepositories. Conclusions: Well-structured, rich contextual data add value, promote reuse, and enable aggregation and integration of disparate datasets. Adoption of the proposed standard and practices will better enable interoperability between datasets and systems, improve the consistency and utility of generated data, and ultimately facilitate novel insights and discoveries in SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.

A high-quality reference genome for this species enhances the ability to discover genetic mechanisms influencing biological traits. Furthermore, a high-quality reference genome allows for precise functional annotation of gene regulatory elements. The rapid advances in genome assembly algorithms and emergence of sequencing technologies with increasingly long reads provide the opportunity for an improved de novo assembly of the sheep reference genome. Findings: Short-read Illumina (55× coverage), long-read Pacific Biosciences (75× coverage), and Hi-C data from this ewe retrieved from public databases were combined with an additional 50× coverage of Oxford Nanopore data and assembled with canu v1.9. The assembled contigs were scaffolded using Hi-C data with Salsa v2.2, gaps filled with PBsuitev15.8.24, and polished with Nanopolish v0.12.5. After duplicate contig removal with PurgeDups v1.0.1, chromosomes were oriented and polished with 2 rounds of a pipeline that consisted of freebayes v1.3.1 to call variants, Merfin to validate them, and BCFtools to generate the consensus fasta. The ARS-UI-Ramb-v2.0 assembly is 2.63 Gb in length and has improved continuity (contig NG50 of 43.18 Mb), with a 19- and 38-fold decrease in the number of scaffolds compared with Oar-rambouillet-v1.0 and Oar-v4.0. ARS-UI-Ramb-v2.0 has greater per-base accuracy and fewer insertions and deletions identified from mapped RNA sequence than previous assemblies. Conclusions: The ARS-UI-Ramb-v2.0 assembly is a substantial improvement in contiguity that will optimize the functional annotation of the sheep genome and facilitate improved mapping accuracy of genetic variant and expression data for traits in sheep. © 2022 The Author(s).

Comparing the composition of samples (functionally/taxonomically), either from a longitudinal study or cross-sectional studies, can provide clues into how the microbiota has adapted to the environment. However, a recurring challenge, especially when comparing results between independent studies, is that key metadata about the sample and molecular methods used to extract and sequence the genetic material are often missing from sequence records, making it difficult to account for confounding factors. Nevertheless, these missing metadata may be found in the narrative of publications describing the research. Here, we describe a machine learning framework that automatically extracts essential metadata for a wide range of metagenomics studies from the literature contained in Europe PMC. This framework has enabled the extraction of metadata from 114,099 publications in Europe PMC, including 19,900 publications describing metagenomics studies in European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and MGnify. Using this framework, a new metagenomics annotations pipeline was developed and integrated into Europe PMC to regularly enrich up-to-date ENA and MGnify metagenomics studies with metadata extracted from research articles. These metadata are now available for researchers to explore and retrieve in the MGnify and Europe PMC websites, as well as Europe PMC annotations API.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Findings: This article shows that the combination of LED gradient set-ups with imaging-based non-destructive plant phenotyping constitutes an interesting new screening tool with the potential to improve speed, logistics, and information output. To validate this concept, an experiment was performed to evaluate the effects of a complete range of red:blue ratios on 7 plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Brachypodium distachyon, Euphorbia peplus, Ocimum basilicum, Oryza sativa, Solanum lycopersicum, and Setaria viridis. Plants were exposed during 30 days to the light gradient and showed significant, but species-dependent, responses in terms of dimension, shape, and color. A time-series analysis of phenotypic descriptors highlighted growth changes but also transient responses of plant shapes to the red:blue ratio.

As opposed to its current narrow and rare distribution, the fossil pollen of B. sinensis has been found to be frequent and widespread in the Northern Hemisphere during the Late Miocene. B. sinensis is also a typical mycorrhizal plant, and its annual seedlings exhibit high mortality rates in absence of mycorrhizal development. The chromosome-level high-quality genome of B. sinensis will help us to more deeply understand the survival and demographic histories of this relic species. Results: A total of 25.39 Gb HiFi reads and 109.17 Gb Hi-C reads were used to construct the chromosome-level genome of B. sinensis, which is 1.21 Gb in length with the contig N50 of 64.13 Mb and chromosome N50 of 146.54 Mb. The identified transposable elements account for 55.21% of the genome. A total of 45,839 protein-coding genes were predicted in B. sinensis. A lineage-specific whole-genome duplication was detected, and 7,283 lineage-specific expanded gene families with functions related to the specialized endotrophic mycorrhizal adaptation were identified. The historical effective population size (Ne) of B. sinensis was found to oscillate greatly in response to Quaternary climatic changes. The Ne of B. sinensis has decreased rapidly in the recent past, making its extant Ne extremely lower. Our additional evolutionary genomic analyses suggested that the developed mycorrhizal adaption might have been repeatedly disrupted by environmental changes caused by Quaternary climatic oscillations. The environmental changes and an already decreased population size during the Holocene may have led to the current rarity of B. sinensis. Conclusion: This is a detailed report of the genome sequences for the family Akaniaceae distributed in evergreen forests in eastern Asia. Such a high-quality genomic resource may provide critical clues for comparative genomics studies of this family in the future. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

High-throughput sequencing at the individual or community level has revolutionized our understanding of microbial ecology, leading to the big data era and improving our ability to link microbial diversity with microbial functions. Recent advances in bioinformatics have been key for developing functional prediction tools based on DNA metabarcoding data and using taxonomic gene information. This cheaper approach in every aspect serves as an alternative to shotgun sequencing. Although these tools are increasingly used by ecologists, an objective evaluation of their modularity, portability, and robustness is lacking. Here, we reviewed 100 scientific papers on functional inference and ecological trait assignment to rank the advantages, specificities, and drawbacks of these tools, using a scientific benchmarking. To date, inference tools have been mainly devoted to bacterial functions, and ecological trait assignment tools, to fungal functions. A major limitation is the lack of reference genomes - compared with the human microbiota - especially for complex ecosystems such as soils. Finally, we explore applied research prospects. These tools are promising and already provide relevant information on ecosystem functioning, but standardized indicators and corresponding repositories are still lacking that would enable them to be used for operational diagnosis. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

These large databases are well suited to train machine learning models, e.g., for forecasting or to extract biomarkers in biomedical settings. Such predictive approaches can use discriminative - rather than generative - modeling and thus open the door to new missing-values strategies. Yet existing empirical evaluations of strategies to handle missing values have focused on inferential statistics. Results: Here we conduct a systematic benchmark of missing-values strategies in predictive models with a focus on large health databases: 4 electronic health record datasets, 1 population brain imaging database, 1 health survey, and 2 intensive care surveys. Using gradient-boosted trees, we compare native support for missing values with simple and state-of-the-art imputation prior to learning. We investigate prediction accuracy and computational time. For prediction after imputation, we find that adding an indicator to express which values have been imputed is important, suggesting that the data are missing not at random. Elaborate missing-values imputation can improve prediction compared to simple strategies but requires longer computational time on large data. Learning trees that model missing values - with missing incorporated attribute - leads to robust, fast, and well-performing predictive modeling.

J. mandshurica produces juglone, which is a toxic allelopathic agent and has potential utilization value. Furthermore, the seed of J. mandshurica is rich in various unsaturated fatty acids and has high nutritive value. Findings: Here, we present a high-quality chromosome-scale reference genome assembly and annotation for J. mandshurica (n = 16) with a contig N50 of 21.4 Mb by combining PacBio high-fidelity reads with high-throughput chromosome conformation capture data. The assembled genome has an estimated sequence size of 548.7 Mb and consists of 657 contigs, 623 scaffolds, and 40,453 protein-coding genes. In total, 60.99% of the assembled genome consists of repetitive sequences. Sixteen super-scaffolds corresponding to the 16 chromosomes were assembled, with a scaffold N50 length of 33.7 Mb and a BUSCO complete gene percentage of 98.3%. J. mandshurica displays a close sequence relationship with Juglans cathayensis, with a divergence time of 13.8 million years ago. Combining the high-quality genome, transcriptome, and metabolomics data, we constructed a gene-to-metabolite network and identified 566 core and conserved differentially expressed genes, which may be involved in juglone biosynthesis. Five CYP450 genes were found that may contribute to juglone accumulation. NAC, bZip, NF-YA, and NF-YC are positively correlated with the juglone content. Some candidate regulators (e.g., FUS3, ABI3, LEC2, and WRI1 transcription factors) involved in the regulation of lipid biosynthesis were also identified. Conclusions: Our genomic data provide new insights into the evolution of the walnut genome and create a new platform for accelerating molecular breeding and improving the comprehensive utilization of these economically important tree species. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

The main variability comprises the different tooth shape, the type of tooth attachment to the underlying bone, or the ability to replace the teeth. Findings: Here, we provide full datasets of microtomography scans and 3D models of reptilian dentitions and skulls. We selected representative species for each of 9 reptilian families on the basis of their characteristic dental features. Because there are ≥4 different types of tooth-bone attachments, ranging from the mammalian-like thecodont attachment found in crocodilians to the simple acrodont implantation observed in some lizards, we aimed to evaluate species with different types of tooth-bone attachments. Moreover, another interesting feature varying in reptilian species is the complexity of tooth shape or the number of tooth generations, which can be associated with the type of tooth attachment to the jawbone. Therefore, selected model species also include animals with distinct tooth morphology along the jaw or different number of tooth generations. The development of tooth attachment and relationship of the tooth to the jaw can be further analysed in detail on a large collection of pre-hatching stages of chameleon. Next, we introduce different possibilities for how these datasets can be further used to study tooth-bone relationships or tooth morphology in 3D space. Moreover, these datasets can be valuable for additional morphological and morphometric analyses of reptilian skulls or their individually segmented skeletal elements. Conclusions: Our collection of microcomputed tomography scans can bring new insight into dental or skeletal research. The broad selection of reptilian species, together with their unique dental features and high quality of these scans including complete series of developmental stages of our model species and provide large opportunities for their reuse.

Somatic variant calling requires a high sequencing depth of the tumor sample, especially when the detection of low-frequency variants is also desired. In turn, this leads to large volumes of raw sequencing data to process and hence, large computational requirements. For example, calling the somatic variants according to the GATK best practices guidelines requires days of computing time for a typical whole-genome sequencing sample. Findings: We introduce Halvade Somatic, a framework for somatic variant calling from DNA sequencing data that takes advantage of multi-node and/or multi-core compute platforms to reduce runtime. It relies on Apache Spark to provide scalable I/O and to create and manage data streams that are processed on different CPU cores in parallel. Halvade Somatic contains all required steps to process the tumor and matched normal sample according to the GATK best practices recommendations: read alignment (BWA), sorting of reads, preprocessing steps such as marking duplicate reads and base quality score recalibration (GATK), and, finally, calling the somatic variants (Mutect2). Our approach reduces the runtime on a single 36-core node to 19.5 h compared to a runtime of 84.5 h for the original pipeline, a speedup of 4.3 times. Runtime can be further decreased by scaling to multiple nodes, e.g., we observe a runtime of 1.36 h using 16 nodes, an additional speedup of 14.4 times. Halvade Somatic supports variant calling from both whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing data and also supports Strelka2 as an alternative or complementary variant calling tool. We provide a Docker image to facilitate single-node deployment. Halvade Somatic can be executed on a variety of compute platforms, including Amazon EC2 and Google Cloud. Conclusions: To our knowledge, Halvade Somatic is the first somatic variant calling pipeline that leverages Big Data processing platforms and provides reliable, scalable performance.

Despite the popularity of this approach, little attention has been paid to the question of provenance tracing in this context, e.g., determining how much any experimental observation in the input contributes to the score of every prediction. Results: We design a network propagation framework with 2 novel components and apply it to predict human proteins that directly or indirectly interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. First, we trace the provenance of each prediction to its experimentally validated sources, which in our case are human proteins experimentally determined to interact with viral proteins. Second, we design a technique that helps to reduce the manual adjustment of parameters by users. We find that for every top-ranking prediction, the highest contribution to its score arises from a direct neighbor in a human protein-protein interaction network. We further analyze these results to develop functional insights on SARS-CoV-2 that expand on known biology such as the connection between endoplasmic reticulum stress, HSPA5, and anti-clotting agents. Conclusions: We examine how our provenance-tracing method can be generalized to a broad class of network-based algorithms. We provide a useful resource for the SARS-CoV-2 community that implicates many previously undocumented proteins with putative functional relationships to viral infection. This resource includes potential drugs that can be opportunistically repositioned to target these proteins.

However, with the current substantial availability of viral genome sequences, the scientific repertory lacks a complexity landscape that automatically enlights viral genomes' organization, relation, and fundamental characteristics. Results: This work provides a comprehensive landscape of the viral genome's complexity (or quantity of information), identifying the most redundant and complex groups regarding their genome sequence while providing their distribution and characteristics at a large and local scale. Moreover, we identify and quantify inverted repeats abundance in viral genomes. For this purpose, we measure the sequence complexity of each available viral genome using data compression, demonstrating that adequate data compressors can efficiently quantify the complexity of viral genome sequences, including subsequences better represented by algorithmic sources (e.g., inverted repeats). Using a state-of-the-art genomic compressor on an extensive viral genomes database, we show that double-stranded DNA viruses are, on average, the most redundant viruses while single-stranded DNA viruses are the least. Contrarily, double-stranded RNA viruses show a lower redundancy relative to single-stranded RNA. Furthermore, we extend the ability of data compressors to quantify local complexity (or information content) in viral genomes using complexity profiles, unprecedently providing a direct complexity analysis of human herpesviruses. We also conceive a features-based classification methodology that can accurately distinguish viral genomes at different taxonomic levels without direct comparisons between sequences. This methodology combines data compression with simple measures such as GC-content percentage and sequence length, followed by machine learning classifiers. Conclusions: This article presents methodologies and findings that are highly relevant for understanding the patterns of similarity and singularity between viral groups, opening new frontiers for studying viral genomes' organization while depicting the complexity trends and classification components of these genomes at different taxonomic levels.

The use of high-throughput low-coverage DNA sequencing data can lead to biased estimates of the site frequency spectrum due to high levels of uncertainty in genotyping. Results: Here we design and implement a method to efficiently and accurately estimate the multidimensional joint site frequency spectrum for large numbers of haploid or diploid individuals across an arbitrary number of populations, using low-coverage sequencing data. The method maximizes a likelihood function that represents the probability of the sequencing data observed given a multidimensional site frequency spectrum using genotype likelihoods. Notably, it uses an advanced binning heuristic paired with an accelerated expectation-maximization algorithm for a fast and memory-efficient computation, and can generate both unfolded and folded spectra and bootstrapped replicates for haploid and diploid genomes. On the basis of extensive simulations, we show that the new method requires remarkably less storage and is faster than previous implementations whilst retaining the same accuracy. When applied to low-coverage sequencing data from the fungal pathogen Neonectria neomacrospora, results recapitulate the patterns of population differentiation generated using the original high-coverage data.

Quantitative genetic studies of natural genetic variants frequently examine one or a few traits, limiting their potential to identify pleiotropic effects of natural genetic variants. Widely adopted community association panels have been employed by plant genetics communities to study the genetic basis of naturally occurring phenotypic variation in a wide range of traits. High-density genetic marker data - 18M markers - from 2 partially overlapping maize association panels comprising 1,014 unique genotypes grown in field trials across at least 7 US states and scored for 162 distinct trait data sets enabled the identification of of 2,154 suggestive marker-trait associations and 697 confident associations in the maize genome using a resampling-based genome-wide association strategy. The precision of individual marker-trait associations was estimated to be 3 genes based on a reference set of genes with known phenotypes. Examples were observed of both genetic loci associated with variation in diverse traits (e.g., above-ground and below-ground traits), as well as individual loci associated with the same or similar traits across diverse environments. Many significant signals are located near genes whose functions were previously entirely unknown or estimated purely via functional data on homologs. This study demonstrates the potential of mining community association panel data using new higher-density genetic marker sets combined with resampling-based genome-wide association tests to develop testable hypotheses about gene functions, identify potential pleiotropic effects of natural genetic variants, and study genotype-by-environment interaction. © 2022 The Author(s).

Their lifestyles are extremely diverse, from free-swimming larvae to sessile adults, and even root-like endoparasites. Barnacles also cause hundreds of millions of dollars of losses annually due to biofouling. However, genomic resources for crustaceans, and barnacles in particular, are lacking. Results: Using 62× Pacific Biosciences coverage, 189× Illumina whole-genome sequencing coverage, 203× HiC coverage, and 69× CHi-C coverage, we produced a chromosome-level genome assembly of the gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes. The P. pollicipes genome is 770 Mb long and its assembly is one of the most contiguous and complete crustacean genomes available, with a scaffold N50 of 47 Mb and 90.5% of the BUSCO Arthropoda gene set. Using the genome annotation produced here along with transcriptomes of 13 other barnacle species, we completed phylogenomic analyses on a nearly 2 million amino acid alignment. Contrary to previous studies, our phylogenies suggest that the Pollicipedomorpha is monophyletic and sister to the Balanomorpha, which alters our understanding of barnacle larval evolution and suggests homoplasy in a number of naupliar characters. We also compared transcriptomes of P. pollicipes nauplius larvae and adults and found that nearly one-half of the genes in the genome are differentially expressed, highlighting the vastly different transcriptomes of larvae and adult gooseneck barnacles. Annotation of the genes with KEGG and GO terms reveals that these stages exhibit many differences including cuticle binding, chitin binding, microtubule motor activity, and membrane adhesion. Conclusion: This study provides high-quality genomic resources for a key group of crustaceans.

The long fossil records and low diversity in living species prove their complex evolutionary history, which included ancient radiations and massive extinctions. Due to their ultra-large genome size, the whole-genome assembly of gymnosperms has only generated in the past 10 years and is now being further expanded into more taxonomic representations. Here, we provide an overview of the publicly available gymnosperm genome resources and discuss their assembly quality and recent findings in large genome architectures. In particular, we describe the genomic features most related to changes affecting the whole genome. We also highlight new realizations relative to repetitive sequence dynamics, paleopolyploidy, and long introns. Based on the results of relevant genomic studies of gymnosperms, we suggest additional efforts should be made toward exploring the genomes of medium-sized (5-15 gigabases) species.

Inclusion of these identifiers into the scientific literature has been demonstrated to improve the reproducibility of papers because resources, like antibodies, are easier to find, making methods easier to reproduce. RRIDs also dramatically reduce the use of problematic resources, such as contaminated cell lines. The addition of RRIDs into a manuscript means that authors have to look up information that they may have previously omitted or confront information about problems that may have been reported about their resources. The use of RRIDs is primarily driven by champion journals, such as GigaScience and others.

However, so far, there does not exist a systematic evaluation of scenarios where classical ML methods (such as penalized logistic regression) already perform adequately for AIRR classification. This hinders investigative reorientation to those scenarios where method development of more sophisticated ML approaches may be required. Results: To identify those scenarios where a baseline ML method is able to perform well for AIRR classification, we generated a collection of synthetic AIRR benchmark data sets encompassing a wide range of data set architecture-associated and immune state-associated sequence patterns (signal) complexity. We trained ≈1,700 ML models with varying assumptions regarding immune signal on ≈1,000 data sets with a total of ≈250,000 AIRRs containing ≈46 billion TCRβ CDR3 amino acid sequences, thereby surpassing the sample sizes of current state-of-the-art AIRR-ML setups by two orders of magnitude. We found that L1-penalized logistic regression achieved high prediction accuracy even when the immune signal occurs only in 1 out of 50,000 AIR sequences. Conclusions: We provide a reference benchmark to guide new AIRR-ML classification methodology by (i) identifying those scenarios characterized by immune signal and data set complexity, where baseline methods already achieve high prediction accuracy, and (ii) facilitating realistic expectations of the performance of AIRR-ML models given training data set properties and assumptions. Our study serves as a template for defining specialized AIRR benchmark data sets for comprehensive benchmarking of AIRR-ML methods.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022","Machine Learning; Receptors, Immunologic; T lymphocyte receptor beta chain; immunoglobulin receptor; adaptive immune receptor repertoire; amino acid sequence; Article; benchmarking; cross validation; data classification; feature selection; learning algorithm; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; predictive model; reproducibility; signal noise ratio; support vector machine; VDJ recombination","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131166663"

Most of the current feature selection methods are based on general univariate descriptors of the data such as the dispersion or the percentage of zeros. Despite the use of correction methods, the generality of these feature selection methods biases the genes selected towards highly expressed genes, instead of the genes defining the cell populations of the dataset. Results: Triku is a feature selection method that favors genes defining the main cell populations. It does so by selecting genes expressed by groups of cells that are close in the k-nearest neighbor graph. The expression of these genes is higher than the expected expression if the k-cells were chosen at random. Triku efficiently recovers cell populations present in artificial and biological benchmarking datasets, based on adjusted Rand index, normalized mutual information, supervised classification, and silhouette coefficient measurements. Additionally, gene sets selected by triku are more likely to be related to relevant Gene Ontology terms and contain fewer ribosomal and mitochondrial genes.

This study used DNA metabarcoding to assess spatial and temporal variation in species richness and diversity in arthropod communities from 52 protected areas spanning 3 Canadian ecoregions. Results: This study revealed the presence of 26,263 arthropod species in the 3 ecoregions and indicated that at least another 3,000-5,000 await detection. Results further demonstrate that communities are more similar within than between ecoregions, even after controlling for geographical distance. Overall α-diversity declined from east to west, reflecting a gradient in habitat disturbance. Shifts in species composition were high at every site, with turnover greater than nestedness, suggesting the presence of many transient species. Conclusions: Differences in species composition among their arthropod communities confirm that ecoregions are a useful synoptic for biogeographic patterns and for structuring conservation efforts. The present results also demonstrate that metabarcoding enables large-scale monitoring of shifts in species composition, making it possible to move beyond the biomass measurements that have been the key metric used in prior efforts to track change in arthropod communities.  © 2022 The Author(s).","Animals; Arthropods; Biodiversity; Canada; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; Ecosystem; arthropod; arthropod community; article; biodiversity; biogeographic region; biomass; habitat; nonhuman; species composition; species richness; turnover rate; animal; arthropod; biodiversity; Canada; DNA barcoding; ecosystem; genetics; procedures","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129779536"

It is also the first East Asian multiomic reference genome accompanied by extensive clinical information, time-series and multiomic data, and parental sequencing data. However, it was still not a chromosome-scale reference. Here, we updated the previous KOREF assembly to a new chromosome-level haploid assembly of KOREF, KOREF_S1v2.1. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) PromethION, Pacific Biosciences HiFi-CCS, and Hi-C technology were used to build the most accurate East Asian reference assembled so far. Results: We produced 705 Gb ONT reads and 114 Gb Pacific Biosciences HiFi reads, and corrected ONT reads by Pacific Biosciences reads. The corrected ultra-long reads reached higher accuracy of 1.4% base errors than the previous KOREF_S1v1.0, which was mainly built with short reads. KOREF has parental genome information, and we successfully phased it using a trio-binning method, acquiring a near-complete haploid-assembly. The final assembly resulted in total length of 2.9 Gb with an N50 of 150 Mb, and the longest scaffold covered 97.3% of GRCh38's chromosome 2. In addition, the final assembly showed high base accuracy, with <0.01% base errors. Conclusions: KOREF_S1v2.1 is the first chromosome-scale haploid assembly of the Korean reference genome with high contiguity and accuracy. Our study provides useful resources of the Korean reference genome and demonstrates a new strategy of hybrid assembly that combines ONT's PromethION and PacBio's HiFi-CCS.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

The spatial transcriptomic analysis includes challenging tasks like clustering, where a partition among data points (spots) is defined by means of a similarity measure. Improving clustering results is a key factor as clustering affects subsequent downstream analysis. State-of-the-art approaches group data by taking into account transcriptional similarity and some by exploiting spatial information as well. However, it is not yet clear how much the spatial information combined with transcriptomics improves the clustering result. Results: We propose a new clustering method, Stardust, that easily exploits the combination of space and transcriptomic information in the clustering procedure through a manual or fully automatic tuning of algorithm parameters. Moreover, a parameter-free version of the method is also provided where the spatial contribution depends dynamically on the expression distances distribution in the space. We evaluated the proposed methods results by analyzing ST data sets available on the 10x Genomics website and comparing clustering performances with state-of-the-art approaches by measuring the spots' stability in the clusters and their biological coherence. Stability is defined by the tendency of each point to remain clustered with the same neighbors when perturbations are applied. Conclusions: Stardust is an easy-to-use methodology allowing to define how much spatial information should influence clustering on different tissues and achieving more stable results than state-of-the-art approaches.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Current comparisons of survival model performance mostly center on clinical data with classic statistical survival models, with prediction accuracy often serving as the sole metric of model performance. Moreover, survival analysis approaches for censored omics data have not been thoroughly investigated. The common approach is to binarize the survival time and perform a classification analysis. Here, we develop a benchmarking design, SurvBenchmark, that evaluates a diverse collection of survival models for both clinical and omics data sets. SurvBenchmark not only focuses on classical approaches such as the Cox model but also evaluates state-of-the-art machine learning survival models. All approaches were assessed using multiple performance metrics; these include model predictability, stability, flexibility, and computational issues. Our systematic comparison design with 320 comparisons (20 methods over 16 data sets) shows that the performances of survival models vary in practice over real-world data sets and over the choice of the evaluation metric. In particular, we highlight that using multiple performance metrics is critical in providing a balanced assessment of various models.

Two principally different mechanisms are proposed as major drivers of eukaryotic genome evolution and diversity: polyploidy (i.e., whole-genome duplication) or smaller duplication events and bursts in the activity of repetitive elements. Here, we generated de novo genome assemblies of 17 caddisflies covering all major lineages of Trichoptera. Using these and previously sequenced genomes, we use caddisflies as a model for understanding genome size evolution in diverse insect lineages. Results: We detect a ∼14-fold variation in genome size across the order Trichoptera. We find strong evidence that repetitive element expansions, particularly those of transposable elements (TEs), are important drivers of large caddisfly genome sizes. Using an innovative method to examine TEs associated with universal single-copy orthologs (i.e., BUSCO genes), we find that TE expansions have a major impact on protein-coding gene regions, with TE-gene associations showing a linear relationship with increasing genome size. Intriguingly, we find that expanded genomes preferentially evolved in caddisfly clades with a higher ecological diversity (i.e., various feeding modes, diversification in variable, less stable environments). Conclusion: Our findings provide a platform to test hypotheses about the potential evolutionary roles of TE activity and TE-gene associations, particularly in groups with high species, ecological, and functional diversities.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

In the absence of an effective and available vaccine, and with increasing drug resistance, asexual RBC stage parasites are an important research focus. In recent years, mass spectrometry-based proteomics using data-dependent acquisition has been extensively used to understand the biochemical processes within the parasite. However, data-dependent acquisition is problematic for the detection of low-abundance proteins and proteome coverage and has poor run-to-run reproducibility. Results: Here, we present a comprehensive P. falciparum-infected RBC (iRBC) spectral library to measure the abundance of 44,449 peptides from 3,113 P. falciparum and 1,617 RBC proteins using a data-independent acquisition mass spectrometric approach. The spectral library includes proteins expressed in the 3 morphologically distinct RBC stages (ring, trophozoite, schizont), the RBC compartment of trophozoite-iRBCs, and the cytosolic fraction from uninfected RBCs. This spectral library contains 87% of all P. falciparum proteins that have previously been reported with protein-level evidence in blood stages, as well as 692 previously unidentified proteins. The P. falciparum spectral library was successfully applied to generate semi-quantitative proteomics datasets that characterize the 3 distinct asexual parasite stages in RBCs, and compared artemisinin-resistant (Cam3.IIR539T) and artemisinin-sensitive (Cam3.IIrev) parasites. Conclusion: A reproducible, high-coverage proteomics spectral library and analysis method has been generated for investigating sets of proteins expressed in the iRBC stage of P. falciparum malaria. This will provide a foundation for an improved understanding of parasite biology, pathogenesis, drug mechanisms, and vaccine candidate discovery for malaria.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.","Erythrocytes; Humans; Malaria, Falciparum; Plasmodium falciparum; Proteome; Reproducibility of Results; proteome; proteome; Article; controlled study; cytosol; developmental stage; erythrocyte; erythrocyte structure; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; Plasmodium falciparum; population abundance; protein expression; proteomics; erythrocyte; human; malaria falciparum; metabolism; parasitology; reproducibility","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125846808"

In large-scale experiments, however, UAV images suffer from containing a multitudinous amount of crops in a complex canopy architecture. Especially for the observation of temporal effects, this complicates the recognition of individual plants over several images and the extraction of relevant information tremendously. Results: In this work, we present a hands-on workflow for the automatized temporal and spatial identification and individualization of crop images from UAVs abbreviated as ""cataloging""based on comprehensible computer vision methods. We evaluate the workflow on 2 real-world datasets. One dataset is recorded for observation of Cercospora leaf spot - a fungal disease - in sugar beet over an entire growing cycle. The other one deals with harvest prediction of cauliflower plants. The plant catalog is utilized for the extraction of single plant images seen over multiple time points. This gathers a large-scale spatiotemporal image dataset that in turn can be applied to train further machine learning models including various data layers. Conclusion: The presented approach improves analysis and interpretation of UAV data in agriculture significantly. By validation with some reference data, our method shows an accuracy that is similar to more complex deep learning-based recognition techniques. Our workflow is able to automatize plant cataloging and training image extraction, especially for large datasets. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Several tasks have been developed as a part of this body of research, however their results are not always consistent. A reliable comparison of the data and a synthesis of study conclusions has been precluded by multiple methodological differences. Here, we describe a publicly available, high-density electroencephalography (EEG) dataset obtained from 42 healthy young adults while they performed 3 cognitive tasks: (i) an extended multi-source interference task; (ii) a 3-stimuli oddball task; (iii) a control, simple reaction task; and (iv) a resting-state protocol. Demographic and psychometric information are included within the dataset. Dataset Validation: First, data validation confirmed acceptable quality of the obtained EEG signals. Typical event-related potential (ERP) waveforms were obtained, as expected for attention and cognitive control tasks (i.e., N200, P300, N450). Behavioral results showed the expected progression of reaction times and error rates, which confirmed the effectiveness of the applied paradigms. Conclusions: This dataset is well suited for neuropsychological research regarding common and distinct mechanisms involved in different cognitive tasks. Using this dataset, researchers can compare a wide range of classical EEG/ERP features across tasks for any selected subset of electrodes. At the same time, 128-channel EEG recording allows for source localization and detailed connectivity studies. Neurophysiological measures can be correlated with additional psychometric data obtained from the same participants. This dataset can also be used to develop and verify novel analytical and classification approaches that can advance the field of deep/machine learning algorithms, recognition of single-trial ERP responses to different task conditions, and detection of EEG/ERP features for use in brain-computer interface applications.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.","Brain; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Cognition; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Humans; Young Adult; 3 stimuli oddball task; adult; Article; attention; behavior; cognition; cognitive function test; controlled study; electroencephalography; event related potential; executive function; extended multisource interference task; female; human; human experiment; machine learning; male; normal human; reaction time; resting state network; simple reaction time task; statistical error; validation process; waveform; young adult; brain; brain computer interface; cognition; evoked response; physiology; procedures","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125965098"

Major milestones include creating our own data repository, embracing FAIR principles, promoting and integrating preprints, and working with other platforms to contribute to a 21st century publishing infrastructure. Almost 10 years after GigaScience's launch, UNESCO published its Open Science Recommendations. With these in mind, looking back, we are happy to have contributed in various ways to UNESCO's aim to ""foster a culture of Open Science and aligning incentives for Open Science""from the very beginning, and, more, to use those recommendations to guide our path into the future: to truly embrace the full spectrum of information, tools, and access to Open Science for all participants in scientific endeavours.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Because mudskippers can survive on land for extended periods by breathing through their skin and through the lining of the mouth and throat, they were evaluated as a model for the evolutionary sea-land transition of Devonian protoamphibians, ancestors of all present tetrapods. Results: A total of 39.6, 80.2, 52.9, and 33.3 Gb of Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, 10X linked, and Hi-C data, respectively, was assembled into 1,419 scaffolds with an N50 length of 33 Mb and BUSCO score of 96.6%. The assembly covered 117% of the estimated genome size (729 Mb) and included 23 pseudo-chromosomes anchored by a Hi-C contact map, which corresponded to the top 23 longest scaffolds above 20 Mb and close to the estimated one. Of the genome, 43.8% were various repetitive elements such as DNAs, tandem repeats, long interspersed nuclear elements, and simple repeats. Ab initio and homology-based gene prediction identified 30,505 genes, of which 94% had homology to the 14 Actinopterygii transcriptomes and 89% and 85% to Pfam familes and InterPro domains, respectively. Comparative genomics with 15 Actinopterygii species identified 59,448 gene families of which 12% were only in P. modestus. Conclusions: We present the high quality of the first genome assembly and gene annotation of the shuttles hoppfish.

While several gap-closing methods have been developed, these methods often close an assembly gap with sequence that does not accurately represent the true sequence. Findings: Here, we present DENTIST, a sensitive, highly accurate, and automated pipeline method to close gaps in short-read assemblies with long error-prone reads. DENTIST comprehensively determines repetitive assembly regions to identify reliable and unambiguous alignments of long reads to the correct loci, integrates a consensus sequence computation step to obtain a high base accuracy for the inserted sequence, and validates the accuracy of closed gaps. Unlike previous benchmarks, we generated test assemblies that have gaps at the exact positions where real short-read assemblies have gaps. Generating such realistic benchmarks for Drosophila (134 Mb genome), Arabidopsis (119 Mb), hummingbird (1 Gb), and human (3 Gb) and using simulated or real PacBio continuous long reads, we show that DENTIST consistently achieves a substantially higher accuracy compared to previous methods, while having a similar sensitivity.

To many it began early in 1903 when Teddy Roosevelt and John Muir set up a camp under the Grizzly Giant in the Mariposa Grove of California's Yosemite Valley. Over three days they decided to broaden the US National Park footprint across the USA. Conservationists were inspired in the coming decades by the writings of wildlife conservation pioneers - Osa Johnson (I Married Adventure), Karen Blixen (Out of Africa) and Rachel Carson (The Silent Spring). Countless crusaders developed a passion for preserving dwindling species in those early days, yet none of these conservation advocates mentioned the word genetics, let alone genomics. The genome sequencing projects that have followed on from these have brought in an enormous amount of data, including whole genome sequences for thousands of non-human species, both individual and population wide. This huge resource has revolutionized conservation genetics, bringing in ways to assess the health of at-risk populations, devise genetic-driven breeding strategies, and other means to attempt to preserve the over 1 million species (and growing) under threat today. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

To aid its conservation, the population is the subject of genetic rescue. To understand, monitor, and modulate the effects of genetic rescue on the helmeted honeyeater genome, a chromosome-length genome and a high-density linkage map are required. Results: We used a combination of Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, and Hi-C sequencing technologies to assemble a chromosome-length genome of the helmeted honeyeater, comprising 906 scaffolds, with length of 1.1 Gb and scaffold N50 of 63.8 Mb. Annotation comprised 57,181 gene models. Using a pedigree of 257 birds and 53,111 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we obtained high-density linkage and recombination maps for 25 autosomes and Z chromosome. The total sex-averaged linkage map was 1,347 cM long, with the male map being 6.7% longer than the female map. Recombination maps revealed sexually dimorphic recombination rates (overall higher in males), with average recombination rate of 1.8 cM/Mb. Comparative analyses revealed high synteny of the helmeted honeyeater genome with that of 3 passerine species (e.g., 32 Hi-C scaffolds mapped to 30 zebra finch autosomes and Z chromosome). The genome assembly and linkage map suggest that the helmeted honeyeater exhibits a fission of chromosome 1A into 2 chromosomes relative to zebra finch. PSMC analysis showed a ∼15-fold decline in effective population size to ∼60,000 from mid- to late Pleistocene. Conclusions: The annotated chromosome-length genome and high-density linkage map provide rich resources for evolutionary studies and will be fundamental in guiding conservation efforts for the helmeted honeyeater.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Livestock farming contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, with an important output of methane from enteric fermentation processes, mostly in ruminants. Because ruminal microbiota is directly involved in digestive fermentation processes and methane biosynthesis, understanding the ecological relationships between rumen microorganisms and their active metabolic pathways is essential for reducing emissions. This study analysed whole rumen metagenome using long reads and considering its compositional nature in order to disentangle the role of rumen microbes in methane emissions. Results: The β-diversity analyses suggested a subtle association between methane production and overall microbiota composition (0.01 < R2 < 0.02). Differential abundance analysis identified 36 genera and 279 KEGGs as significantly associated with methane production (Padj < 0.05). Those genera associated with high methane production were Eukaryota from Alveolata and Fungi clades, while Bacteria were associated with low methane emissions. The genus-level association network showed 2 clusters grouping Eukaryota and Bacteria, respectively. Regarding microbial gene functions, 41 KEGGs were found to be differentially abundant between low- and high-emission animals and were mainly involved in metabolic pathways. No KEGGs included in the methane metabolism pathway (ko00680) were detected as associated with high methane emissions. The KEGG network showed 3 clusters grouping KEGGs associated with high emissions, low emissions, and not differentially abundant in either. A deeper analysis of the differentially abundant KEGGs revealed that genes related with anaerobic respiration through nitrate degradation were more abundant in low-emission animals. Conclusions: Methane emissions are largely associated with the relative abundance of ciliates and fungi. The role of nitrate electron acceptors can be particularly important because this respiration mechanism directly competes with methanogenesis. Whole metagenome sequencing is necessary to jointly consider the relative abundance of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota in the statistical analyses. Nutritional and genetic strategies to reduce CH4 emissions should focus on reducing the relative abundance of Alveolata and Fungi in the rumen.

Implicit within the treaty is the idea that mega-biodiverse countries will provide genetic resources and grant access to them and scientists in high-income countries will use these resources and share back benefits. However, little research has been conducted on how this framework is reflected in real-life scientific practice. Result: Currently, parties to the CBD are debating whether digital sequence information (DSI) should be regulated under a new benefit-sharing framework. At this critical time point in the upcoming international negotiations, we test the fundamental hypothesis of provision and use of DSI by looking at the global patterns of access and use in scientific publications. Conclusion: Our data reject the provider-user relationship and suggest a far more complex information flow for DSI. Therefore, any new policy decisions on DSI should be aware of the high level of use of DSI across low- and middle-income countries and seek to preserve open access to this crucial common good.  © 2021 The Author(s).","Biodiversity; International Cooperation; article; biodiversity; middle income country; negotiation; open access; international cooperation","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125525955"

Several software packages exist for analyzing amplicon data, among which QIIME 2 has emerged as a popular option because of its broad functionality, plugin architecture, provenance tracking, and interactive visualizations. However, each new analysis requires the user to keep track of input and output file names, parameters, and commands; this lack of automation and standardization is inefficient and creates barriers to meta-analysis and sharing of results. Findings: We developed Tourmaline, a Python-based workflow that implements QIIME 2 and is built using the Snakemake workflow management system. Starting from a configuration file that defines parameters and input files - a reference database, a sample metadata file, and a manifest or archive of FASTQ sequences - it uses QIIME 2 to run either the DADA2 or Deblur denoising algorithm; assigns taxonomy to the resulting representative sequences; performs analyses of taxonomic, alpha, and beta diversity; and generates an HTML report summarizing and linking to the output files. Features include support for multiple cores, automatic determination of trimming parameters using quality scores, representative sequence filtering (taxonomy, length, abundance, prevalence, or ID), support for multiple taxonomic classification and sequence alignment methods, outlier detection, and automated initialization of a new analysis using previous settings. The workflow runs natively on Linux and macOS or via a Docker container. We ran Tourmaline on a 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon data set from Lake Erie surface water, showing its utility for parameter optimization and the ability to easily view interactive visualizations through the HTML report, QIIME 2 viewer, and R- and Python-based Jupyter notebooks. Conclusion: Automated workflows like Tourmaline enable rapid analysis of environmental amplicon data, decreasing the time from data generation to actionable results.

The F1 hybrids of female channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) × male blue catfish (Ictalurusfurcatus) have been the primary driver of US catfish production in recent years because of superior growth, survival, and carcass yield. The channel-blue hybrid also provides an excellent model to investigate molecular mechanisms of environment-dependent heterosis. However, transcriptome and methylome studies suffered from low alignment rates to the channel catfish genome due to divergence, and the genome resources for blue catfish are not publicly available. Results: The blue catfish genome assembly is 841.86 Mbp in length with excellent continuity (8.6 Mbp contig N50, 28.2 Mbp scaffold N50) and completeness (98.6% Eukaryota and 97.0% Actinopterygii BUSCO). A total of 30,971 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 21,781 were supported by RNA sequencing evidence. Phylogenomic analyses revealed that it diverged from channel catfish approximately 9 million years ago with 15.7 million fixed nucleotide differences. The within-species single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density is 0.32% between the most aquaculturally important blue catfish strains (D&B and Rio Grande). Gene family analysis discovered significant expansion of immune-related families in the blue catfish lineage, which may contribute to disease resistance in blue catfish. Conclusions: We reported the first high-quality, chromosome-level assembly of the blue catfish genome, which provides the necessary genomic tool kit for transcriptome and methylome analysis, SNP discovery and marker-assisted selection, gene editing and genome engineering, and reproductive enhancement of the blue catfish and hybrid catfish.  © 2022 The Author(s).

However, generating adequate labels for these structures is a critical barrier, given the time and effort required from pathologists. Results: This article describes a novel collaborative framework for engaging crowds of medical students and pathologists to produce quality labels for cell nuclei. We used this approach to produce the NuCLS dataset, containing >220,000 annotations of cell nuclei in breast cancers. This builds on prior work labeling tissue regions to produce an integrated tissue region- and cell-level annotation dataset for training that is the largest such resource for multi-scale analysis of breast cancer histology. This article presents data and analysis results for single and multi-rater annotations from both non-experts and pathologists. We present a novel workflow that uses algorithmic suggestions to collect accurate segmentation data without the need for laborious manual tracing of nuclei. Our results indicate that even noisy algorithmic suggestions do not adversely affect pathologist accuracy and can help non-experts improve annotation quality. We also present a new approach for inferring truth from multiple raters and show that non-experts can produce accurate annotations for visually distinctive classes.

Because of the high diversity of PVP sequences, the PVP annotation of a phage genome remains a particularly challenging bioinformatic task. Findings: Based on deep learning, we developed DeePVP. The main module of DeePVP aims to discriminate PVPs from non-PVPs within a phage genome, while the extended module of DeePVP can further classify predicted PVPs into the 10 major classes of PVPs. Compared with the present state-of-the-art tools, the main module of DeePVP performs better, with a 9.05% higher F1-score in the PVP identification task. Moreover, the overall accuracy of the extended module of DeePVP in the PVP classification task is approximately 3.72% higher than that of PhANNs. Two application cases show that the predictions of DeePVP are more reliable and can better reveal the compact PVP-enriched region than the current state-of-the-art tools. Particularly, in the Escherichia phage phiEC1 genome, a novel PVP-enriched region that is conserved in many other Escherichia phage genomes was identified, indicating that DeePVP will be a useful tool for the analysis of phage genomic structures. Conclusions: DeePVP outperforms state-of-the-art tools. The program is optimized in both a virtual machine with graphical user interface and a docker so that the tool can be easily run by noncomputer professionals.

This clade is characterized by the succession of stages and modes of reproduction during metagenic lifecycles, and includes some of the most plastic body plans and life cycles among animals. The characterization of traditional genomic features, such as chromosome numbers and genome sizes, was rather overlooked in Medusozoa and many evolutionary questions still remain unanswered. Modern genomic DNA sequencing in this group started in 2010 with the publication of the Hydra vulgaris genome and has experienced an exponential increase in the past 3 years. Therefore, an update of the state of Medusozoa genomics is warranted. We reviewed different sources of evidence, including cytogenetic records and high-throughput sequencing projects. We focused on 4 main topics that would be relevant for the broad Cnidaria research community: (i) taxonomic coverage of genomic information; (ii) continuity, quality, and completeness of high-throughput sequencing datasets; (iii) overview of the Medusozoa specific research questions approached with genomics; and (iv) the accessibility of data and metadata. We highlight a lack of standardization in genomic projects and their reports, and reinforce a series of recommendations to enhance future collaborative research. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022","Animals; Cnidaria; Genome; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Sequence Analysis, DNA; access to information; Cnidaria; Cubozoa; cytogenetics; gene sequence; gene structure; genetic analysis; high throughput sequencing; Hydrozoa; jellyfish; Medusozoa; nonhuman; Review; standardization; Staurozoa; animal; Cnidaria; DNA sequence; genetics; genome; genomics","Oxford University Press","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130126956"

State-of-the-art techniques quantifymessenger RNA expression levels fromtissue sections and at the same time register information about the original locations of the molecules in the tissue. The resulting data sets are processed and analyzed by accompanying software that, however, is incompatible across inputs from different technologies. Findings: Here, we present spacemake, a modular, robust, and scalable spatial transcriptomics pipeline built in Snakemake and Python. Spacemake is designed to handle all major spatial transcriptomics data sets and can be readily configured for other technologies. It can process and analyze several samples in parallel, even if they stem from different experimentalmethods. Spacemake's unified framework enables reproducible data processing from raw sequencing data to automatically generated downstream analysis reports. Spacemake is built with a modular design and offers additional functionality such as sample merging, saturation analysis, and analysis of long reads as separate modules. Moreover, spacemake employs novoSpaRc to integrate spatial and single-cell transcriptomics data, resulting in increased gene counts for the spatial data set. Spacemake is open source and extendable, and it can be seamlessly integrated with existing computational workflows.  © The Author(s) 2022.","Computational Biology; RNA, Messenger; Software; Transcriptome; Workflow; messenger RNA; transcriptome; article; bioinformatics; pipeline; reproducibility; sequence analysis; single cell RNA seq; software; transcriptomics; workflow; biology; procedures; software; workflow","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134554292"

Cave animals have evolved a set of morphological, physiological, and behavioural adaptations known as troglomorphisms, enabling their survival in the perpetual darkness, narrow temperature and humidity ranges, and nutrient scarcity of the subterranean environment. In this study, we focused on adaptations of skull shape and sensory systems in the blind cave salamander, Proteus anguinus, also known as olm or simply proteus - the largest cave tetrapod and the only European amphibian living exclusively in subterranean environments. This extraordinary amphibian compensates for the loss of sight by enhanced non-visual sensory systems including mechanoreceptors, electroreceptors, and chemoreceptors. We compared developmental stages of P. anguinus with Ambystoma mexicanum, also known as axolotl, to make an exemplary comparison between cave- and surface-dwelling paedomorphic salamanders. Findings: We used contrast-enhanced X-ray computed microtomography for the 3D segmentation of the soft tissues in the head of P. anguinus and A. mexicanum. Sensory organs were visualized to elucidate how the animal is adapted to living in complete darkness. X-ray microCT datasets were provided along with 3D models for larval, juvenile, and adult specimens, showing the cartilage of the chondrocranium and the position, shape, and size of the brain, eyes, and olfactory epithelium. Conclusions: P. anguinus still keeps some of its secrets. Our high-resolution X-ray microCT scans together with 3D models of the anatomical structures in the head may help to elucidate the nature and origin of the mechanisms behind its adaptations to the subterranean environment, which led to a series of troglomorphisms.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.","Animals; Darkness; Proteidae; Urodela; X-Rays; adult; Ambystoma mexicanum; Amphibia; article; brain; cartilage; cave; chemoreceptor; contrast enhancement; controlled study; darkness; developmental stage; electroreceptor; juvenile; mechanoreceptor; micro-computed tomography; nonhuman; olfactory epithelium; Proteus anguinus; radiography; salamander; sensory system; skull; soft tissue; tetrapod; animal; Caudata; darkness; Proteidae; X ray","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128160485"

Herein we report the first chromosome-level reference genome of P. borealis and an essential tool to further investigate the basis of the divergent morphology. Findings: In total, 57.76 Gb of a long read and 70.83 Gb of short-read data were generated to assemble a de novo 561-Mb reference genome of P. borealis, and Hi-C sequencing data (57.47 Gb) were used for scaffolding into 22 chromosomal scaffolds comprising 92.38% of the genome. The genome completeness estimated by BUSCO was 98.0% using the metazoan set, indicating a high-quality assembly. Through the comparative genome analysis, we identified evolutionary accelerated genes known to be involved in morphogenesis and regeneration, suggesting their potential role in shaping body pattern and capacity of regeneration.

However, DIA data analysis remains challenging owing to the high complexity and large data and sample size, which require specialized software and vast computing infrastructures. Most available open-source DIA software necessitates basic programming skills and covers only a fraction of a complete DIA data analysis. In consequence, DIA data analysis often requires usage of multiple software tools and compatibility thereof, severely limiting the usability and reproducibility. Findings: To overcome this hurdle, we have integrated a suite of open-source DIA tools in the Galaxy framework for reproducible and version-controlled data processing. The DIA suite includes OpenSwath, PyProphet, diapysef, and swath2stats. We have compiled functional Galaxy pipelines for DIA processing, which provide a web-based graphical user interface to these pre-installed and pre-configured tools for their use on freely accessible, powerful computational resources of the Galaxy framework. This approach also enables seamless sharing workflows with full configuration in addition to sharing raw data and results. We demonstrate the usability of an all-in-one DIA pipeline in Galaxy by the analysis of a spike-in case study dataset. Additionally, extensive training material is provided to further increase access for the proteomics community. Conclusion: The integration of an open-source DIA analysis suite in the web-based and user-friendly Galaxy framework in combination with extensive training material empowers a broad community of researches to perform reproducible and transparent DIA data analysis. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

This appropriate phasing of these alleles ensures that combinations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms on any chromosome, called haplotypes, can then be used in downstream genetic analysis approaches including determining their potential association with important phenotypic traits. A number of statistical algorithms and complementary computational software tools have been developed for whole-genome haplotype construction from genomic sequence data. However, many algorithms lack the ability to phase long haplotype blocks and simultaneously achieve a competitive accuracy. Results: In this research we present HaploMaker, a novel reference-based haplotype assembly algorithm capable of accurately and efficiently phasing long haplotypes using paired-end short reads and longer Pacific Biosciences reads from diploid genomic sequences. To achieve this we frame the problem as a directed acyclic graph with edges weighted on read evidence and use efficient path traversal and minimization techniques to optimally phase haplotypes. We compared the HaploMaker algorithm with 3 other common reference-based haplotype assembly tools using public haplotype data of human individuals from the Platinum Genome project. With short-read sequences, the HaploMaker algorithm maintained a competitively low switch error rate across all haplotype lengths and was superior in phasing longer genomic regions. For longer Pacific Biosciences reads, the phasing accuracy of HaploMaker remained competitive for all block lengths and generated substantially longer block lengths than the competing algorithms. Conclusions: HaploMaker provides an improved haplotype assembly algorithm for diploid genomic sequences by accurately phasing longer haplotypes. The computationally efficient and portable nature of the Java implementation of the algorithm will ensure that it has maximal impact in reference-sequence-based haplotype assembly applications. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.","Algorithms; Alleles; Genomics; Haplotypes; Humans; Nucleotides; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Analysis, DNA; nucleotide; algorithm; Article; controlled study; diploidy; DNA fragmentation; gene sequence; genomic sequence; HaploMaker; haplotype; haplotype assembly; human; indel mutation; intermethod comparison; mathematical computing; measurement accuracy; methodology; minimization technique; path traversal technique; phasing; statistical error; switch error rate; allele; DNA sequence; genomics; haplotype; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130173981"

Here, we benchmarked several datasets with the most common alignment tools for single-cell RNA sequencing data. We evaluated differences in the whitelisting, gene quantification, overall performance, and potential variations in clustering or detection of differentially expressed genes. We compared the tools Cell Ranger version 6, STARsolo, Kallisto, Alevin, and Alevin-fry on 3 published datasets for human and mouse, sequenced with different versions of the 10X sequencing protocol. Results: Striking differences were observed in the overall runtime of the mappers. Besides that, Kallisto and Alevin showed variances in the number of valid cells and detected genes per cell. Kallisto reported the highest number of cells; however, we observed an overrepresentation of cells with low gene content and unknown cell type. Conversely, Alevin rarely reported such low-content cells. Further variations were detected in the set of expressed genes. While STARsolo, Cell Ranger 6, Alevin-fry, and Alevin produced similar gene sets, Kallisto detected additional genes from the Vmn and Olfr gene family, which are likely mapping artefacts. We also observed differences in the mitochondrial content of the resulting cells when comparing a prefiltered annotation set to the full annotation set that includes pseudogenes and other biotypes.

However, a high-quality reference genome for the black widow spider was still unavailable, which hindered deep understanding and application of the valuable biomass. Findings: We assembled the Latrodectus elegans genome, including a genome size of 1.57 Gb with contig N50 of 4.34 Mb and scaffold N50 of 114.31 Mb. Hi-C scaffolding assigned 98.08% of the genome to 14 pseudo-chromosomes, and with BUSCO, completeness analysis revealed that 98.4% of the core eukaryotic genes were completely present in this genome. Annotation of this genome identified that repetitive sequences account for 506.09 Mb (32.30%) and 20,167 protein-coding genes, and specifically, we identified 55 toxin genes and 26 spidroins and provide preliminary analysis of their composition and evolution.

The goal of FDG-fPET is to maintain a constant plasma supply of radioactive FDG in order to track, with high temporal resolution, the dynamic uptake of glucose during neuronal activity that occurs in response to a task or at rest. FDG-fPET has most often been applied in simultaneous BOLD-fMRI/FDG-fPET (blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI fluorodeoxyglucose functional positron emission tomography) imaging. BOLD-fMRI/FDG-fPET provides the capability to image the 2 primary sources of energetic dynamics in the brain, the cerebrovascular haemodynamic response and cerebral glucose uptake. Findings: In this Data Note, we describe an open access dataset, Monash DaCRA fPET-fMRI, which contrasts 3 radiotracer administration protocols for FDG-fPET: bolus, constant infusion, and hybrid bolus/infusion. Participants (n = 5 in each group) were randomly assigned to each radiotracer administration protocol and underwent simultaneous BOLD-fMRI/FDG-fPET scanning while viewing a flickering checkerboard. The bolus group received the full FDG dose in a standard bolus administration, the infusion group received the full FDG dose as a slow infusion over the duration of the scan, and the bolus-infusion group received 50% of the FDG dose as bolus and 50% as constant infusion. We validate the dataset by contrasting plasma radioactivity, grey matter mean uptake, and task-related activity in the visual cortex.

These lemurs are of particular interest, given their status as a flagship species and widespread publicity in the popular media. Unfortunately, a recent population decline has resulted in the census population decreasing to <2,500 individuals in the wild, and the species's classification as an endangered species by the IUCN. As is the case for most strepsirrhine primates, only a limited amount of genomic research has been conducted on L. catta, in part owing to the lack of genomic resources. Results: We generated a new high-quality reference genome assembly for L. catta (mLemCat1) that conforms to the standards of the Vertebrate Genomes Project. This new long-read assembly is composed of Pacific Biosciences continuous long reads (CLR data), Optical Mapping Bionano reads, Arima HiC data, and 10X linked reads. The contiguity and completeness of the assembly are extremely high, with scaffold and contig N50 values of 90.982 and 10.570 Mb, respectively. Additionally, when compared to other high-quality primate assemblies, L. catta has the lowest reported number of Alu elements, which results predominantly from a lack of AluS and AluY elements. Conclusions: MLemCat1 is an excellent genomic resource not only for the ring-tailed lemur community, but also for other members of the Lemuridae family, and is the first very long read assembly for a strepsirrhine.  © 2022 The Author(s).

CLas is transmitted by Diaphorina citri, the Asian citrus psyllid. Development of transmission-blocking strategies to manage huanglongbing relies on knowledge of CLas and D. citri interactions at the molecular level. Prior transcriptome analyses of D. citri point to changes in psyllid biology due to CLas infection but have been hampered by incomplete versions of the D. citri genome, proper host plant controls, and/or a lack of a uniform data analysis approach. In this work, we present lessons learned from a quantitative transcriptome analysis of excised heads, salivary glands, midguts, and bacteriomes from CLas-positive and CLas-negative D. citri using the chromosomal length D. citri genome assembly. Results: Each organ had a unique transcriptome profile and response to CLas infection. Though most psyllids were infected with the bacterium, CLas-derived transcripts were not detected in all organs. By analyzing the midgut dataset using both the Diaci-v1.1 and v3.0 D. citri genomes, we showed that improved genome assembly led to significant and quantifiable differences in RNA-sequencing data interpretation. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that future transcriptome studies on circulative, vector-borne pathogens should be conducted at the tissue-specific level using complete, chromosomal-length genome assemblies for the most accurate understanding of pathogen-induced changes in vector gene expression.  © 2022 The Author(s).","Animals; Citrus; Genomics; Hemiptera; Liberibacter; Plant Diseases; Rhizobiaceae; Transcriptome; amino acid transporter; proteome; transcriptome; transcriptome; amino acid sequence; Article; bacterial microbiome; bioinformatics; Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus; controlled study; data analysis; Diaphorina citri; Diaphorina citri infection; down regulation; fungus growth; gene expression; gene mapping; gene silencing; genetic transcription; genomics; genotype; head; hematological parameters; hypothesis; infection; insect vector; midgut; nonhuman; phylogeny; plant growth; plant pathogen interaction; quality control; quantitative analysis; RNA extraction; RNA sequencing; salivary gland; statistical analysis; transcriptomics; animal; Citrus; genetics; Hemiptera; Liberibacter; microbiology; plant disease; Rhizobiaceae","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129780216"

To identify cell-type-specific APA genes in scRNA-Seq data, current bioinformatic methods have several limitations. First, they assume certain read coverage shapes in the scRNA-Seq data, which can be violated in multiple APA genes. Second, their identification is limited between 2 cell types and not directly applicable to the data of multiple cell types. Third, they do not control undesired source of variance, which potentially introduces noise to the cell-type-specific identification of APA genes. Findings: We developed a combination of a computational change-point algorithm and a statistical model, single-cell Multi-group identification of APA (scMAPA). To avoid the assumptions on the read coverage shape, scMAPA formulates a change-point problem after transforming the 3 biased scRNA-Seq data to represent the full-length 3-UTR signal. To identify cell-type-specific APA genes while adjusting for undesired source of variation, scMAPA models APA isoforms in consideration of the cell types and the undesired source. In our novel simulation data and data from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, scMAPA outperforms existing methods in sensitivity, robustness, and stability. In mouse brain data consisting of multiple cell types sampled from multiple regions, scMAPA identifies cell-type-specific APA genes, elucidating novel roles of APA for dividing immune cells and differentiated neuron cells and in multiple brain disorders. Conclusions: scMAPA elucidates the cell-type-specific function of APA events and sheds novel insights into the functional roles of APA events in complex tissues.  © 2022 The Author(s).","3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Mice; Polyadenylation; Sequence Analysis, RNA; 3' untranslated region; algorithm; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; astrocyte; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; confounding variable; controlled study; hematopoietic stem cell; human; human cell; human tissue; immunocompetent cell; mouse; nerve cell; nonhuman; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; polyadenylation; principal component analysis; sensitivity and specificity; simulation; single cell RNA seq; animal; mononuclear cell; procedures; sequence analysis","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129206614"

However, metagenomic assembly, especially when only short reads are available, is a complex and challenging task because mixed genomes of multiple microorganisms constitute the metagenome. Although long read sequencing technologies have been developed and have begun to be used for metagenomic assembly, many metagenomic studies have been performed based on short reads because the generation of long reads requires higher sequencing cost than short reads. Results: In this study, we present a new method called PLR-GEN. It creates pseudo-long reads from metagenomic short reads based on given reference genome sequences by considering small sequence variations existing in individual genomes of the same or different species. When applied to a mock community data set in the Human Microbiome Project, PLR-GEN dramatically extended short reads in length of 101 bp to pseudo-long reads with N50 of 33 Kbp and 0.4% error rate. The use of these pseudo-long reads generated by PLR-GEN resulted in an obvious improvement of metagenomic assembly in terms of the number of sequences, assembly contiguity, and prediction of species and genes. Conclusions: PLR-GEN can be used to generate artificial long read sequences without spending extra sequencing cost, thus aiding various studies using metagenomes.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022","High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Microbiota; Sequence Analysis, DNA; article; high throughput sequencing; human; metagenome; metagenomics; microbiome; nonhuman; prediction; DNA sequence; genetics; high throughput sequencing; metagenomics; microflora; procedures","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130202943"

High-throughput metagenomic sequencing of microbial samples enables profiling of AMR genes through comparison with curated AMR databases. However, the performance of current methods is often hampered by database incompleteness and the presence of homology/homoplasy with other non-AMR genes in sequenced samples. Results: We present AMR-meta, a database-free and alignment-free approach, based on k-mers, which combines algebraic matrix factorization into metafeatures with regularized regression. Metafeatures capture multi-level gene diversity across the main antibiotic classes. AMR-meta takes in reads from metagenomic shotgun sequencing and outputs predictions about whether those reads contribute to resistance against specific classes of antibiotics. In addition, AMR-meta uses an augmented training strategy that joins an AMR gene database with non-AMR genes (used as negative examples). We compare AMR-meta with AMRPlusPlus, DeepARG, and Meta-MARC, further testing their ensemble via a voting system. In cross-validation, AMR-meta has a median f-score of 0.7 (interquartile range, 0.2-0.9). On semi-synthetic metagenomic data - external test - on average AMR-meta yields a 1.3-fold hit rate increase over existing methods. In terms of run-time, AMR-meta is 3 times faster than DeepARG, 30 times faster than Meta-MARC, and as fast as AMRPlusPlus. Finally, we note that differences in AMR ontologies and observed variance of all tools in classification outputs call for further development on standardization of benchmarking data and protocols. Conclusions: AMR-meta is a fast, accurate classifier that exploits non-AMR negative sets to improve sensitivity and specificity. The differences in AMR ontologies and the high variance of all tools in classification outputs call for the deployment of standard benchmarking data and protocols, to fairly compare AMR prediction tools. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

The Puerto Rico PROTECT cohort is a well-characterized prospective birth cohort that was designed to investigate environmental and social contributors to preterm birth in Puerto Rico, where preterm birth rates have been elevated in recent decades. To elucidate possible relationships between metabolites and preterm birth in this cohort, we conducted a nested case-control study to conduct untargeted metabolomic characterization of maternal plasma of 31 women who experienced preterm birth and 69 controls who underwent full-Term labor at 24-28 gestational weeks. Results: A total of 333 metabolites were identified and annotated with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Subsequent weighted gene correlation network analysis shows that the fatty acid and carene-enriched module has a significant positive association (P = 8e-04, FDR = 0.006) with preterm birth. After controlling for potential clinical confounders, a total of 38 metabolites demonstrated significant changes uniquely associated with preterm birth, where 17 of them were preterm biomarkers. Among 7 machine-learning classifiers, the application of random forest achieved a highly accurate and specific prediction (AUC = 0.92) for preterm birth in testing data, demonstrating their strong potential as biomarkers for preterm births. The 17 preterm biomarkers are involved in cell signaling, lipid metabolism, and lipid peroxidation functions. Additional modeling using only the 19 spontaneous preterm births (sPTB) and controls identifies 16 sPTB markers, with an AUC of 0.89 in testing data. Half of the sPTB overlap with those markers for preterm births. Further causality analysis infers that suberic acid upregulates several fatty acids to promote preterm birth.

Many initiatives aiming at obtaining a reference genome of cultivar Chinese Spring have been launched in the past years and it was achieved in 2018 as the result of a huge effort to combine short-read sequencing with many other resources. Reference-quality genome assemblies were then produced for other accessions, but the rapid evolution of sequencing technologies offers opportunities to reach high-quality standards at lower cost. Results: Here, we report on an optimized procedure based on long reads produced on the Oxford Nanopore Technology PromethION device to assemble the genome of the French bread wheat cultivar Renan. Conclusions: We provide the most contiguous chromosome-scale assembly of a bread wheat genome to date. Coupled with an annotation based on RNA-sequencing data, this resource will be valuable for the crop community and will facilitate the rapid selection of agronomically important traits.

However, little is known about the evolution of the phenotype and phylogeny of these birds at the whole-genome level. So far, there are no reports regarding the genetic mechanism of the formation of leucism plumage in this variant of Indian peafowl. Results: A draft genome of Indian peafowl was assembled, with a genome size of 1.05 Gb (the sequencing depth is 362×), and contig and scaffold N50 were up to 6.2 and 11.4 Mb, respectively. Compared with other birds, Indian peafowl showed changes in terms of metabolism, immunity, and skeletal and feather development, which provided a novel insight into the phenotypic evolution of peafowl, such as the large body size and feather morphologies. Moreover, we determined that the phylogeny of Indian peafowl was more closely linked to turkey than chicken. Specifically, we first identified that PMEL was a potential causal gene leading to the formation of the leucism plumage variant in Indian peafowl. Conclusions: This study provides an Indian peafowl genome of high quality, as well as a novel understanding of phenotypic evolution and phylogeny of Indian peafowl. These results provide a valuable reference for the study of avian genome evolution. Furthermore, the discovery of the genetic mechanism for the development of leucism plumage is both a breakthrough in the exploration of peafowl plumage and also offers clues and directions for further investigations of the avian plumage coloration and artificial breeding in peafowl.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.","Animals; Feathers; Female; Genome Size; Genomics; Male; Phylogeny; Quail; transcriptome; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; body size; bone development; chicken; feather; female; gene frequency; genome; genome size; genomics; immunity; leucism plumage; metabolism; morphology; multigene family; nonhuman; Pavo cristatus; phylogeny; plumage; synteny; targeted resequencing; turkey (bird); animal; feather; male; phylogeny; procedures; quail","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127629344"

Genetic gain by molecular breeding has been limited, partially because cassava is a highly heterozygous crop with a repetitive and difficult-to-assemble genome. Findings: Here we demonstrate that Pacific Biosciences high-fidelity (HiFi) sequencing reads, in combination with the assembler hifiasm, produced genome assemblies at near complete haplotype resolution with higher continuity and accuracy compared to conventional long sequencing reads. We present 2 chromosome-scale haploid genomes phased with Hi-C technology for the diploid African cassava variety TME204. With consensus accuracy >QV46, contig N50 >18 Mb, BUSCO completeness of 99%, and 35k phased gene loci, it is the most accurate, continuous, complete, and haplotype-resolved cassava genome assembly so far. Ab initio gene prediction with RNA-seq data and Iso-Seq transcripts identified abundant novel gene loci, with enriched functionality related to chromatin organization, meristem development, and cell responses. During tissue development, differentially expressed transcripts of different haplotype origins were enriched for different functionality. In each tissue, 20-30% of transcripts showed allele-specific expression (ASE) differences. ASE bias was often tissue specific and inconsistent across different tissues. Direction-shifting was observed in <2% of the ASE transcripts. Despite high gene synteny, the HiFi genome assembly revealed extensive chromosome rearrangements and abundant intra-genomic and inter-genomic divergent sequences, with large structural variations mostly related to LTR retrotransposons. We use the reference-quality assemblies to build a cassava pan-genome and demonstrate its importance in representing the genetic diversity of cassava for downstream reference-guided omics analysis and breeding. Conclusions: The phased and annotated chromosome pairs allow a systematic view of the heterozygous diploid genome organization in cassava with improved accuracy, completeness, and haplotype resolution. They will be a valuable resource for cassava breeding and research. Our study may also provide insights into developing cost-effective and efficient strategies for resolving complex genomes with high resolution, accuracy, and continuity.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Findings: Here, Pacific Biosciences and Hi-C sequencing technologies were used to assemble a new upland cotton genome of the No. 1 Chinese cotton variety CRI-12. We generated a high-quality assembled CRI-12 genome of 2.31 Gb with a contig N50 of 19.65 Mb, which was superior to previously reported genomes. Comparisons between CRI-12 and other reported genomes revealed 7,966 structural variations and 7,378 presence/absence variations. The distribution of the haplotypes among A-genome (Gossypium arboreum), D-genome (Gossypium raimondii), and AD-genome (G. hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense) suggested that many haplotypes were lost and recombined in the process of polyploidization. More than half of the haplotypes that correlated with different tolerances were located on chromosome D13, suggesting that this chromosome may be important for wide adaptation. Finally, it was demonstrated that DNA methylation may provide advantages in environmental adaptation through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing analysis.

Booklice are able to survive under heat treatment and typically possess high resistance to common fumigant insecticides, hence posing a threat to storage security worldwide. Results: We assembled the genome of the booklouse, L. brunnea, the first genome reported in Psocoptera, using PacBio long-read sequencing, Illumina sequencing, and chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) methods. After assembly, polishing, haplotype purging, and Hi-C scaffolding,we obtained 9 linkage groups (174.1 Mb in total) ranging from 12.1 Mb to 27.6 Mb (N50: 19.7 Mb), with the BUSCO completeness at 98.9%. In total, 15,543 geneswere predicted by theMaker pipeline. Gene family analyses indicated the sensing-related gene families (OBP and OR) and the resistance-related gene families (ABC, EST, GST,UGT, and P450) expanded significantly in L. brunnea compared with those of their closest relatives (2 parasitic lice). Based on transcriptomic analysis, we found that the CYP4 subfamily from the P450 gene family functioned during phosphine fumigation; HSP genes, particularly those from the HSP70 subfamily, were upregulated significantly under high temperatures. Conclusions: We present a chromosome-level genome assembly of L. brunnea, the first genome reported for the order Psocoptera.

However, the exact cause of many of these cross-phenotype associations is still unknown. One potential reason is shared genetic etiology-common genetic drivers may lead to the onset of multiple phenotypes. Disease-disease networks (DDNs), where nodes represent diseases and edges represent associations between diseases, can provide an intuitive way of understanding the relationships between phenotypes. Using summary statistics from a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), we can generate a corresponding DDN where edges represent shared genetic variants between diseases. Such a network can help us analyze genetic associations across the diseasome, the landscape of all human diseases, and identify potential genetic influences for disease complications. Results: To improve the ease of network-based analysis of shared genetic components across phenotypes, we developed the humaN disEase phenoType MAp GEnerator (NETMAGE), a web-based tool that produces interactive DDN visualizations from PheWAS summary statistics. Users can search the map by various attributes and select nodes to view related phenotypes, associated variants, and various network statistics. As a test case, we used NETMAGE to construct a network from UK BioBank (UKBB) PheWAS summary statistic data. Our map correctly displayed previously identified disease comorbidities from the UKBB and identified concentrations of hub diseases in the endocrine/metabolic and circulatory disease categories. By examining the associations between phenotypes in our map, we can identify potential genetic explanations for the relationships between diseases and better understand the underlying architecture of the human diseasome. Our tool thus provides researchers with a means to identify prospective genetic targets for drug design, using network medicine to contribute to the exploration of personalized medicine. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

A high-quality reference genome sequence assembly of E. glaucum is a resource for functional and evolutionary studies of Ensete, Musaceae, and the Zingiberales. Findings: Using Oxford Nanopore Technologies, chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), Illumina and RNA survey sequence, supported by molecular cytogenetics, we report a high-quality 481.5 Mb genome assembly with 9 pseudo-chromosomes and 36,836 genes. A total of 55% of the genome is composed of repetitive sequences with predominantly LTR-retroelements (37%) and DNA transposons (7%). The single 5S ribosomal DNA locus had an exceptionally long monomer length of 1,056 bp, more than twice that of the monomers at multiple loci in Musa. A tandemly repeated satellite (1.1% of the genome, with no similar sequence in Musa) was present around all centromeres, together with a few copies of a long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) retroelement. The assembly enabled us to characterize in detail the chromosomal rearrangements occurring between E. glaucum and the x = 11 species of Musa. One E. glaucum chromosome has the same gene content as Musa acuminata, while others show multiple, complex, but clearly defined evolutionary rearrangements in the change between x= 9 and 11. Conclusions: The advance towards a Musaceae pangenome including E. glaucum, tolerant of extreme environments, makes a complete set of gene alleles, copy number variation, and a reference for structural variation available for crop breeding and understanding environmental responses. The chromosome-scale genome assembly shows the nature of chromosomal fusion and translocation events during speciation, and features of rapid repetitive DNA change in terms of copy number, sequence, and genomic location, critical to understanding its role in diversity and evolution.  © 2022 The Author(s).","Chromosomes; DNA Copy Number Variations; DNA Transposable Elements; Musa; Musaceae; Plant Breeding; Retroelements; Sequence Analysis, DNA; monomer; repetitive DNA; satellite DNA; transcriptome; abiotic stress; Arecaceae; Article; Aspergillus niger; bioinformatics; Brachypodium; centromere; chromosome; chromosome arm; chromosome number; chromosome structure; comparative genomic hybridization; Convolvulaceae; copy number variation; Cuscuta; cytogenetics; DNA extraction; DNA library; DNA sequence; DNA transposon; Ensete glaucum; evolution; extreme environment; flow cytometry; fluorescence in situ hybridization; fluorometry; gene identification; gene ontology; gene sequence; genome; genome analysis; genome size; genomics; heterozygosity; in situ hybridization; inverted repeat; long interspersed nuclear element; long terminal repeat retrotransposon; Musaceae; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; phylogenomics; phylogeny; plant gene; plant genetics; protein phosphorylation; RNA extraction; sequence analysis; sequence evolution; synteny; tandem repeat; Triticum aestivum; genetics; Musa; Musaceae; plant breeding; retroposon; transposon","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129219819"

In this study, we evaluated prey detection using metabarcoding and a method of mapping unassembled shotgun reads (Lazaro). Results: In a mock prey community, metabarcoding did not detect any prey, probably owing to primer choice and/or preferential predator DNA amplification, while Lazaro detected prey with accuracy 43-71%. Gut content analysis of field-collected arthropod epigeal predators (3 ants, 1 dermapteran, and 1 carabid) from agricultural habitats in Brazil (27 samples, 46-273 individuals per sample) revealed that 64% of the prey species detections by either method were not confirmed by melting curve analysis and 87% of the true prey were detected in common. We hypothesized that Lazaro would detect fewer true- and false-positive and more false-negative prey with greater taxonomic resolution than metabarcoding but found that the methods were similar in sensitivity, specificity, false discovery rate, false omission rate, and accuracy. There was a positive correlation between the relative prey DNA concentration in the samples and the number of prey reads detected by Lazaro, while this was inconsistent for metabarcoding. Conclusions: Metabarcoding and Lazaro had similar, but partially complementary, detection of prey in arthropod predator guts. However, while Lazaro was almost 2× more expensive, the number of reads was related to the amount of prey DNA, suggesting that Lazaro may provide quantitative prey information while metabarcoding did not.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

An unprecedented ongoing global initiative is producing hundreds of thousands of sequences worldwide. However, the complex circumstances in which viruses are sequenced, along with the demand of urgent results, causes a high rate of incomplete and, therefore, useless sequences. Viral sequences evolve in the context of a complex phylogeny and different positions along the genome are in linkage disequilibrium. Therefore, an imputation method would be able to predict missing positions from the available sequencing data. Results: We have developed the impuSARS application, which takes advantage of the enormous number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available, using a reference panel containing 239,301 sequences, to produce missing data imputation in viral genomes. ImpuSARS was tested in a wide range of conditions (continuous fragments, amplicons or sparse individual positions missing), showing great fidelity when reconstructing the original sequences, recovering the lineage with a 100% precision for almost all the lineages, even in very poorly covered genomes (<20%). Conclusions: Imputation can improve the pace of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing production by recovering many incomplete or low-quality sequences that would be otherwise discarded. ImpuSARS can be incorporated in any primary data processing pipeline for SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

In addition to cataloguing biodiversity, these data provide the basis for understanding biological function and evolution. Accurate and complete genome assemblies offer a comprehensive and reliable foundation upon which to advance our understanding of organismal biology at genetic, species, and ecosystem levels. However, ever-changing sequencing technologies and analysis methods mean that available data are often heterogeneous in quality. To guide forthcoming genome generation efforts and promote efficient prioritization of resources, it is thus essential to define and monitor taxonomic coverage and quality of the data. Findings: Here we present an automated analysis workflow that surveys genome assemblies from the United States NCBI, assesses their completeness using the relevant BUSCO datasets, and collates the results into an interactively browsable resource. We apply our workflow to produce a community resource of available assemblies from the phylum Arthropoda, the Arthropoda Assembly Assessment Catalogue. Using this resource, we survey current taxonomic coverage and assembly quality at the NCBI, examine how key assembly metrics relate to gene content completeness, and compare results from using different BUSCO lineage datasets. Conclusions: These results demonstrate how the workflow can be used to build a community resource that enables large-scale assessments to survey species coverage and data quality of available genome assemblies, and to guide prioritizations for ongoing and future sampling, sequencing, and genome generation initiatives.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

The potential for integrating across such data sets offers new opportunities to better understand biodiversity and how it might respond to global change. However, large-scale synthesesmay be compromised if metabarcoding workflows differ from each other. There are ongoing efforts to improve standardization for the reporting of inventory data. However, harmonization at the stage of generating metabarcode data has yet to be addressed. A modular framework for harmonized data generation offers a pathway to navigate the complex structure of terrestrial metazoan biodiversity. Here, through our collective expertise as practitioners,method developers, and researchers leading metabarcoding initiatives to inventory terrestrial biodiversity, we seek to initiate a harmonized framework for metabarcode data generation, with a terrestrial arthropod module. We develop an initial set of submodules covering the 5 main steps of metabarcode data generation: (i) sample acquisition; (ii) sample processing; (iii) DNA extraction; (iv) polymerase chain reaction amplification, library preparation, and sequencing; and (v) DNA sequence and metadata deposition, providing a backbone for a terrestrial arthropod module. To achieve this, we (i) identified key points for harmonization, (ii) reviewed the current state of the art, and (iii) distilled existing knowledge within submodules, thus promoting best practice by providing guidelines and recommendations to reduce the universe of methodological options.We advocate the adoption and further development of the terrestrial arthropodmodule.We further encourage the development of modules for other biodiversity fractions as an essential step toward large-scale biodiversity synthesis through harmonization.  © The Author(s) 2022.","Animals; Arthropods; Biodiversity; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; Longitudinal Studies; adoption; arthropod; article; big data; biodiversity; cosmos; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; gene amplification; human; metadata; nonhuman; physician; polymerase chain reaction; practice guideline; reproducibility; standardization; synthesis; animal; biodiversity; DNA barcoding; genetics; longitudinal study","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134557257"

This stems from the fact that most acquired ARGs require being overexpressed before conferring resistance, which is often caused by decontextualization of putative ARGs by mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Consequent overexpression of ARGs can be caused by strong promoters often present in insertion sequence (IS) elements and integrons and the copy number effect of plasmids, which may contribute to high expression of accessory genes. Results: Here, we screen all complete bacterial RefSeq genomes for ARGs. The genetic contexts of detected ARGs are investigated for IS elements, integrons, plasmids, and phylogenetic dispersion. The ARG-MOB scale is proposed, which indicates how mobilized detected ARGs are in bacterial genomes. It is concluded that antibiotic efflux genes are rarely mobilized and even 80% of β-lactamases have never, or very rarely, been mobilized in the 15,790 studied genomes. However, some ARGs are indeed mobilized and co-occur with IS elements, plasmids, and integrons. Conclusions: In this study, ARGs in all complete bacterial genomes are classified by their association with MGEs, using the proposed ARG-MOB scale. These results have consequences for the design and interpretation of studies screening for resistance determinants, as mobilized ARGs pose a more concrete risk to human health. An interactive table of all results is provided for future studies targeting highly mobilized ARGs.  © 2022 The Author(s).

However, a systematic quantification of the research interest that the scientific community has allocated to individual species remains a big data problem. Scalable approaches are needed to integrate biodiversity data sets and bibliometric methods across large numbers of species. The outputs of these analyses are important for identifying understudied species and directing future research to fill these gaps. Findings: In this study, we used the species h-index to quantity the research interest in 7,521 species of mammals. We tested factors potentially driving species h-index, by using a Bayesian phylogenetic generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). We found that a third of the mammals had a species h-index of zero, while a select few had inflated research interest. Further, mammals with higher species h-index had larger body masses; were found in temperate latitudes; had their humans uses documented, including domestication; and were in lower-risk International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List categories. These results surprisingly suggested that critically endangered mammals are understudied. A higher interest in domesticated species suggested that human use is a major driver and focus in mammalian scientific literature. Conclusions: Our study has demonstrated a scalable workflow and systematically identified understudied species of mammals, as well as identified the likely drivers of this taxonomic bias in the literature. This case study can become a benchmark for future research that asks similar biological and meta-research questions for other taxa.  © 2022 The Author(s).

The morphometric quantification of these networks is essential to study the cellular phenotype. Commonly, the quantitative measurements are performed on 2D projections of the image stack, resulting in the loss of information in the third dimension. Currently available 3D image analysis tools rely on manual interactions with the software and are therefore not feasible for large datasets. Findings: Here we present Qiber3D, an open-source image processing toolkit. The software package includes the essential image analysis procedures required for image processing, from the raw image to the quantified data. Optional pre-processing steps can be switched on/off depending on the input data to allow for analyzing networks from a variety of sources. Two reconstruction algorithms are offered to meet the requirements for a wide range of network types. Furthermore, Qiber3D's rendering capabilities enable the user to inspect each step of the image analysis process interactively to ensure the creation of an optimal workflow for each application. Conclusions: Qiber3D is implemented as a Python package, and its source code is freely available at https://github.com/theia-dev/Qiber3D. The toolkit was designed using a building block principle to enable the analysis of a variety of structures, such as vascular networks, neuronal structures, or scaffolds from numerous input formats. While Qiber3D can be used interactively in the Python console, it is aimed at unsupervised automation to process large image datasets efficiently.  © 2022 The Author(s).

A fundamental question in plant biology is the extent to which below-ground activity in the root system influences above-ground phenotypes expressed in the shoot system. Grafting, an ancient horticultural practice that fuses the root system of one individual (the rootstock) with the shoot system of a second, genetically distinct individual (the scion), is a powerful experimental system to understand below-ground effects on above-ground phenotypes. Previous studies on grafted grapevines have detected rootstock influence on scion phenotypes including physiology and berry chemistry. However, the extent of the rootstock's influence on leaves, the photosynthetic engines of the vine, and how those effects change over the course of a growing season, are still largely unknown. Results: Here, we investigate associations between rootstock genotype and shoot system phenotypes using 5 multi-dimensional leaf phenotyping modalities measured in a common grafted scion: ionomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, morphometrics, and physiology. Rootstock influence is ubiquitous but subtle across modalities, with the strongest signature of rootstock observed in the leaf ionome. Moreover, we find that the extent of rootstock influence on scion phenotypes and patterns of phenomic covariation are highly dynamic across the season. Conclusions: These findings substantially expand previously identified patterns to demonstrate that rootstock influence on scion phenotypes is complex and dynamic and underscore that broad understanding necessitates volumes of multi-dimensional data previously unmet.  © 2021 The Author(s).","Genotype; Phenotype; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Seasons; article; berry; genotype; grape; growing season; ionomics; metabolomics; morphometry; nonhuman; phenotype; photosynthesis; plant leaf; rhizome; root system; shoot; transcriptomics; genetics; genotype; plant root; season","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123036940"

The evolution of snakes and their venom has been studied for decades, particularly via traditional morphological and basic genetic methods alongside venom proteomics. However, while the field of genomics has matured rapidly over the past 2 decades, owing to the development of next-generation sequencing technologies, snake genomics remains in its infancy. Here, we provide an overview of the state of the art in snake genomics and discuss its potential implications for studying venom evolution and toxinology. On the basis of current knowledge, gene duplication and positive selection are key mechanisms in the neofunctionalization of snake venom proteins. This makes snake venoms important evolutionary drivers that explain the remarkable venom diversification and adaptive variation observed in these reptiles. Gene duplication and neofunctionalization have also generated a large number of repeat sequences in snake genomes that pose a significant challenge to DNA sequencing, resulting in the need for substantial computational resources and longer sequencing read length for high-quality genome assembly. Fortunately, owing to constantly improving sequencing technologies and computational tools, we are now able to explore the molecular mechanisms of snake venom evolution in unprecedented detail. Such novel insights have the potential to affect the design and development of antivenoms and possibly other drugs, as well as provide new fundamental knowledge on snake biology and evolution. © The Author(s) 2022.

Infection by Schistosoma mansoni in humans results when cercariae emerge into water from freshwater snails in the genus Biomphalaria and seek out and penetrate human skin. The snail Biomphalaria straminea is native to South America and is now also present in Central America and China, and represents a potential vector host for spreading schistosomiasis. To date, genomic information for the genus is restricted to the neotropical species Biomphalaria glabrata. This limits understanding of the biology and management of other schistosomiasis vectors, such as B. straminea. Findings: Using a combination of Illumina short-read, 10X Genomics linked-read, and Hi-C sequencing data, our 1.005 Gb B. straminea genome assembly is of high contiguity, with a scaffold N50 of 25.3 Mb. Transcriptomes from adults were also obtained. Developmental homeobox genes, hormonal genes, and stress-response genes were identified, and repeat content was annotated (40.68% of genomic content). Comparisons with other mollusc genomes (including Gastropoda, Bivalvia, and Cephalopoda) revealed syntenic conservation, patterns of homeobox gene linkage indicative of evolutionary changes to gene clusters, expansion of heat shock protein genes, and the presence of sesquiterpenoid and cholesterol metabolic pathway genes in Gastropoda. In addition, hormone treatment together with RT-qPCR assay reveal a sesquiterpenoid hormone responsive system in B. straminea, illustrating that this renowned insect hormonal system is also present in the lophotrochozoan lineage. Conclusion: This study provides the first genome assembly for the snail B. straminea and offers an unprecedented opportunity to address a variety of phenomena related to snail vectors of schistosomiasis, as well as evolutionary and genomics questions related to molluscs more widely. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Here, we introduce the genome of the desert horned lizard, Phrynosoma platyrhinos, an iguanid lizard occupying extreme desert conditions of the American southwest. We conduct analysis of the chromosomal structure and composition of this species and compare these features across genomes of 12 other reptiles (5 species of lizards, 3 snakes, 3 turtles, and 1 bird). Findings: The desert horned lizard genome was sequenced using Illumina paired-end reads and assembled and scaffolded using Dovetail Genomics Hi-C and Chicago long-range contact data. The resulting genome assembly has a total length of 1,901.85 Mb, scaffold N50 length of 273.213 Mb, and includes 5,294 scaffolds. The chromosome-level assembly is composed of 6 macrochromosomes and 11 microchromosomes. A total of 20,764 genes were annotated in the assembly. GC content and gene density are higher for microchromosomes than macrochromosomes, while repeat element distributions show the opposite trend. Pathway analyses provide preliminary evidence that microchromosome and macrochromosome gene content are functionally distinct. Synteny analysis indicates that large microchromosome blocks are conserved among closely related species, whereas macrochromosomes show evidence of frequent fusion and fission events among reptiles, even between closely related species. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate dynamic karyotypic evolution across Reptilia, with frequent inferred splits, fusions, and rearrangements that have resulted in shuffling of chromosomal blocks between macrochromosomes and microchromosomes. Our analyses also provide new evidence for distinct gene content and chromosomal structure between microchromosomes and macrochromosomes within reptiles.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Supervised artificial intelligence algorithms require large ground truth image datasets for model training, which allows to validate or refute research hypotheses and to carry out comparisons between models. However, public datasets of images are scarce and ground truth images are surprisingly few considering the numbers required for training algorithms. Results: We created a dataset of 1,283 multidimensional arrays, using berries from five different grape varieties. Each array has 37 images of wavelengths between 488.38 and 952.76 nm obtained from single berries. Coupled to each multispectral image, we added a dataset with measurements including, weight, anthocyanin content, and Brix index for each independent grape. Thus, the images have paired measures, creating a ground truth dataset. We tested the dataset with 2 neural network algorithms: multilayer perceptron (MLP) and 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN). A perfect (100% accuracy) classification model was fit with either the MLP or 3D-CNN algorithms. Conclusions: This is the first public dataset of grape ground truth multispectral images. Associated with each multispectral image, there are measures of the weight, anthocyanins, and Brix index. The dataset should be useful to develop deep learning algorithms for classification, dimensionality reduction, regression, and prediction analysis. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

It belongs to the same bird family (Anatidae) as the mallard, one of the best-studied natural hosts of low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Studies in non-model bird species are crucial to disentangle the role of the host response in avian influenza virus infection in the natural reservoir. Such endeavour requires a high-quality genome assembly and transcriptome. Findings: This study presents the first high-quality, chromosome-level reference genome assembly of the tufted duck using the Vertebrate Genomes Project pipeline. We sequenced RNA (complementary DNA) from brain, ileum, lung, ovary, spleen, and testis using Illumina short-read and Pacific Biosciences long-read sequencing platforms, which were used for annotation. We found 34 autosomes plus Z and W sex chromosomes in the curated genome assembly, with 99.6% of the sequence assigned to chromosomes. Functional annotation revealed 14,099 protein-coding genes that generate 111,934 transcripts, which implies a mean of 7.9 isoforms per gene. We also identified 246 small RNA families. Conclusions: This annotated genome contributes to continuing research into the host response in avian influenza virus infections in a natural reservoir. Our findings from a comparison between short-read and long-read reference transcriptomics contribute to a deeper understanding of these competing options. In this study, both technologies complemented each other. We expect this annotation to be a foundation for further comparative and evolutionary genomic studies, including many waterfowl relatives with differing susceptibilities to avian influenza viruses.  © 2021 The Author(s).","Animals; Ducks; Female; Genome; Genomics; Humans; Influenza in Birds; Male; Transcriptome; complementary DNA; retinoic acid inducible protein I; transcriptome; transcriptome; animal genetics; animal tissue; Article; avian influenza; Aythya fuligula; brain; chromosome; comparative study; controlled study; disease predisposition; DNA extraction; duck; female; gene interaction; gene synthesis; genetic code; genetic conservation; genetic identification; genetic transcription; genome analysis; ileum; illumina sequencing; immune response; lung; male; molecular genetics; nonhuman; ovary; protein expression; RNA extraction; RNA sequencing; sex chromosome; spleen; testis; tissue preparation; transcriptomics; animal; avian influenza; duck; genetics; genome; genomics; human","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122908548"

Unfortunately, genome-wide interaction association studies involve many statistical challenges that make such detection hard. We propose a multi-step protocol for epistasis detection along the edges of a gene-gene co-function network. Such an approach reduces the number of tests performed and provides interpretable interactions while keeping type I error controlled. Yet, mapping gene interactions into testable single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-interaction hypotheses, as well as computing gene pair association scores from SNP pair ones, is not trivial. Results: Here we compare 3 SNP-gene mappings (positional overlap, expression quantitative trait loci, and proximity in 3D structure) and use the adaptive truncated product method to compute gene pair scores. This method is non-parametric, does not require a known null distribution, and is fast to compute. We apply multiple variants of this protocol to a genome-wide association study dataset on inflammatory bowel disease. Different configurations produced different results, highlighting that various mechanisms are implicated in inflammatory bowel disease, while at the same time, results overlapped with known disease characteristics. Importantly, the proposed pipeline also differs from a conventional approach where no network is used, showing the potential for additional discoveries when prior biological knowledge is incorporated into epistasis detection.  © 2022 The Author(s).

As one of the sister groups of winged insects, odonatan species are key to understanding the evolution of insect wings. Findings: We present a high-quality reference genome of P. flavescens, which is the first chromosome-level genome in the Palaeoptera (Odonata and Ephemeroptera). The assembled genome size was 662 Mb, with a contig N50 of 16.2 Mb. Via Hi-C scaffolding, 648 Mb (97.9%) of contig sequences were clustered, ordered, and assembled into 12 large scaffolds, each corresponding to a natural chromosome. The X chromosome was identified by sequence coverage depth. The repetitive sequences and gene density of the X chromosome are similar to those of autosomal sequences, but the X chromosome shows a much lower degree of heterozygosity. Our analysis shows that the effective population size experienced 3 declining events, which may have been caused by climate change and environmental pollution.

Results: By comparison to existing GO annotation datasets, GOMAP-generated datasets cover more genes, contain more GO terms, and are similar in quality (based on precision and recall metrics using existing gold standards as the basis for comparison). From there, we sought to determine whether the datasets across multiple species could be used together to carry out comparative functional genomics analyses in plants. To test the idea and as a proof of concept, we created dendrograms of functional relatedness based on terms assigned for all 18 genomes. These dendrograms were compared to well-established species-level evolutionary phylogenies to determine whether trees derived were in agreement with known evolutionary relationships, which they largely are. Where discrepancies were observed, we determined branch support based on jackknifing then removed individual annotation sets by genome to identify the annotation sets causing unexpected relationships. Conclusions: GOMAP-derived functional annotations used together across multiple species generally retain sufficient biological signal to recover known phylogenetic relationships based on genome-wide functional similarities, indicating that comparative functional genomics across species based on GO data holds promise for generating novel hypotheses about comparative gene function and traits.  © 2022 The Author(s).","Databases, Genetic; Gene Ontology; Genome, Plant; Genomics; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Phylogeny; Plants; article; comparative genomics; functional genomics; gene function; gene ontology; gold standard; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; prediction; proof of concept; recall; gene ontology; genetic database; genetics; genomics; molecular genetics; plant; plant genome","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128487198"

Understanding its diversity and genomic makeup can help in fighting established infections and prohibiting further transmission. The basis of every genomic study is a high-quality reference genome that has continuity and completeness, thus enabling comprehensive comparative studies. Findings: Here, we provide a highly accurate and complete reference genome of Cryptosporidium parvum. The assembly is based on Oxford Nanopore reads and was improved using Illumina reads for error correction. We also outline how to evaluate and choose from different assembly methods based on 2 main approaches that can be applied to other Cryptosporidium species. The assembly encompasses 8 chromosomes and includes 13 telomeres that were resolved. Overall, the assembly shows a high completion rate with 98.4% single-copy BUSCO genes.

Yet, a successful prediction may capture a confounding effect correlated with the outcome instead of brain features specific to the outcome of interest. For instance, because patients tend to move more in the scanner than controls, imaging biomarkers of a disease condition may mostly reflect head motion, leading to inefficient use of resources and wrong interpretation of the biomarkers. Results: Here we study how to adapt statistical methods that control for confounds to predictive modeling settings. We review how to train predictors that are not driven by such spurious effects. We also show how to measure the unbiased predictive accuracy of these biomarkers, based on a confounded dataset. For this purpose, cross-validation must be modified to account for the nuisance effect. To guide understanding and practical recommendations, we apply various strategies to assess predictive models in the presence of confounds on simulated data and population brain imaging settings. Theoretical and empirical studies show that deconfounding should not be applied to the train and test data jointly: modeling the effect of confounds, on the training data only, should instead be decoupled from removing confounds. Conclusions: Cross-validation that isolates nuisance effects gives an additional piece of information: confound-free prediction accuracy.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.","Biomarkers; Brain; Humans; Machine Learning; biological marker; biological marker; Article; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; measurement accuracy; prediction; predictive model; simulation; standard; statistical analysis; validation process; brain; diagnostic imaging; human; machine learning","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126389182"

There are many excellent tools for designing CRISPR-Cas guide RNAs (gRNAs) for model organisms with standard Cas enzymes. GuideMaker is intended as a fast and easy-to-use design tool for challenging projects with (i) non-standard Cas enzymes, (ii) non-model organisms, or (iii) projects that need to design a panel of gRNA for genome-wide screens. Findings: GuideMaker can rapidly design gRNAs for gene targets across the genome using a degenerate protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) and a genome. The tool applies hierarchical navigable small world graphs to speed up the comparison of guide RNAs and optionally provides on-target and off-target scoring. This allows the user to design effective gRNAs targeting all genes in a typical bacterial genome in ∼1-2 minutes. Conclusions: GuideMaker enables the rapid design of genome-wide gRNA for any CRISPR-Cas enzyme in non-model organisms.

Recent advancements in long-read and long-range genome sequencing have made it possible to produce high-quality chromosome-level genome assemblies for almost any organism. However, adequate tissue preservation for the requisite ultra-high molecular weight DNA (uHMW DNA) remains a major challenge. Here we present a comparative study of preservation methods for field and laboratory tissue sampling, across vertebrate classes and different tissue types. Results: We find that storage temperature was the strongest predictor of uHMW fragment lengths. While immediate flash-freezing remains the sample preservation gold standard, samples preserved in 95% EtOH or 20-25% DMSO-EDTA showed little fragment length degradation when stored at 4°C for 6 hours. Samples in 95% EtOH or 20-25% DMSO-EDTA kept at 4°C for 1 week after dissection still yielded adequate amounts of uHMW DNA for most applications. Tissue type was a significant predictor of total DNA yield but not fragment length. Preservation solution had a smaller but significant influence on both fragment length and DNA yield. Conclusion: We provide sample preservation guidelines that ensure sufficient DNA integrity and amount required for use with long-read and long-range sequencing technologies across vertebrates. Our best practices generated the uHMW DNA needed for the high-quality reference genomes for phase 1 of the Vertebrate Genomes Project, whose ultimate mission is to generate chromosome-level reference genome assemblies of all ∼70,000 extant vertebrate species.  © 2022 The Author(s).

The study of such systems benefits from the use of spatially explicit computational models that combine a discrete description of cells with a continuum description of one or more chemicals diffusing within a surrounding bulk medium. These models allow the in silico testing and refinement of mechanistic hypotheses. However, most existing models of this type do not account for concurrent bulk and intracellular biochemical reactions and their possible coupling. Conclusions: Here, we describe ChemChaste, an extension for the open-source C++ computational biology library Chaste. ChemChaste enables the spatial simulation of both multicellular and bulk biochemistry by expanding on Chaste's existing capabilities. In particular, ChemChaste enables (i) simulation of an arbitrary number of spatially diffusing chemicals, (ii) spatially heterogeneous chemical diffusion coefficients, and (iii) inclusion of both bulk and intracellular biochemical reactions and their coupling. ChemChaste also introduces a file-based interface that allows users to define the parameters relating to these functional features without the need to interact directly with Chaste's core C++ code. We describe ChemChaste and demonstrate its functionality using a selection of chemical and biochemical exemplars, with a focus on demonstrating increased ability in modeling bulk chemical reactions and their coupling with intracellular reactions.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

The traditional management of plant waste, including landfill and incineration, usually causes serious environmental pollution and health problems. Interestingly, the xylophagous beetle, Trypoxylus dichotomus, can decompose lignocellulosic biomass. However, the genomics around the digestion mechanism of this beetle remain to be elucidated. Here, we assembled the genome of T. dichotomus, showing that the draft genome size of T. dichotomus is 636.27 Mb, with 95.37% scaffolds anchored onto 10 chromosomes. Phylogenetic results indicated that a divergent evolution between the ancestors of T. dichotomus and the closely related scarabaeid species Onthophagus taurus occurred in the early Cretaceous (120 million years ago). Through gene family evolution analysis, we found 67 rapidly evolving gene families, within which there were 2 digestive gene families (encoding Trypsin and Enoyl-(Acyl carrier protein) reductase) that have experienced significant expansion, indicating that they may contribute to the high degradation efficiency of lignocellulose in T. dichotomus. Additionally, events of chromosome breakage and rearrangement were observed by synteny analysis during the evolution of T. dichotomus due to chromosomes 6 and 8 of T. dichotomus being intersected with chromosomes 2 and 10 of Tribolium castaneum, respectively. Furthermore, the comparative transcriptome analyses of larval guts showed that the digestion-related genes were more commonly expressed in the midgut or mushroom residue group than the hindgut or sawdust group. This study reports the well-assembled and annotated genome of T. dichotomus, providing genomic and transcriptomic bases for further understanding the functional and evolutionary mechanisms of lignocellulose digestion in T. dichotomus.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Mining such a huge amount of multisource heterogeneous data is becoming an increasingly difficult challenge, so efficient and accurate compare and search of samples is in urgent need: faced with millions of samples in the data repository, traditional sample comparison and search approaches fall short in speed and accuracy. Findings: Here we proposed Meta-Prism 2.0, a microbial community sample analysis method that has pushed the time and memory efficiency to a new limit without compromising accuracy. Based on sparse data structure, time-saving instruction pipeline, and SIMD optimization, Meta-Prism 2.0 has enabled ultra-fast, memory-efficient, flexible, and accurate search among millions of samples. Meta-Prism 2.0 was put to test on several data sets, with the largest containing 1 million samples. Results show that Meta-Prism 2.0's 0.00001-s per sample pair compare speed and 8-GB memory needs for searching against 1 million samples have made it one of the most efficient sample analysis methods. Additionally, Meta-Prism 2.0 can achieve accuracy comparable with or better than other contemporary methods. Third, Meta-Prism 2.0 can precisely identify the original biome for samples, thus enabling sample source tracking. Finally, we have provided a web server for fast search of microbial community samples online.

Amid growing concerns regarding an ""infodemic,""ensuring the quality of information is a crucial vector of public health. Investigating whether and how Wikipedia remained up to date and in line with science is key to formulating strategies to counter misinformation. Using citation analyses, we asked which sources informed Wikipedia's COVID-19-related articles before and during the pandemic's first wave (January-May 2020). Results: We found that coronavirus-related articles referenced trusted media outlets and high-quality academic sources. Regarding academic sources, Wikipedia was found to be highly selective in terms of what science was cited. Moreover, despite a surge in COVID-19 preprints, Wikipedia had a clear preference for open-access studies published in respected journals and made little use of preprints. Building a timeline of English-language COVID-19 articles from 2001-2020 revealed a nuanced trade-off between quality and timeliness. It further showed how pre-existing articles on key topics related to the virus created a framework for integrating new knowledge. Supported by a rigid sourcing policy, this ""scientific infrastructure""facilitated contextualization and regulated the influx of new information. Last, we constructed a network of DOI-Wikipedia articles, which showed the landscape of pandemic-related knowledge on Wikipedia and how academic citations create a web of shared knowledge supporting topics like COVID-19 drug development. Conclusions: Understanding how scientific research interacts with the digital knowledge-sphere during the pandemic provides insight into how Wikipedia can facilitate access to science. It also reveals how, aided by what we term its ""citizen encyclopedists,""it successfully fended off COVID-19 disinformation and how this unique model may be deployed in other contexts. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

However, non-poly(A)-enriched RNA-seq contains large proportions of intronic reads that also span genomic breakpoints. Results: We have developed an algorithm, Dr. Disco, that searches for fusion transcripts by taking an entire reference genome into account as search space. This includes exons but also introns, intergenic regions, and sequences that do not meet splice junction motifs. Using 1,275 RNA-seq samples, we investigated to what extent genomic breakpoints can be extracted from RNA-seq data and their implications regarding poly(A)-enriched and ribosomal RNA-minus RNA-seq data. Comparison with whole-genome sequencing data revealed that most genomic breakpoints are not, or minimally, transcribed while, in contrast, the genomic breakpoints of all 32 TMPRSS2-ERG-positive tumours were present at RNA level. We also revealed tumours in which the ERG breakpoint was located before ERG, which co-existed with additional deletions and messenger RNA that incorporated intergenic cryptic exons. In breast cancer we identified rearrangement hot spots near CCND1 and in glioma near CDK4 and MDM2 and could directly associate this with increased expression. Furthermore, in all datasets we find fusions to intergenic regions, often spanning multiple cryptic exons that potentially encode neo-antigens. Thus, fusion transcripts other than classical gene-to-gene fusions are prominently present and can be identified using RNA-seq. Conclusion: By using the full potential of non-poly(A)-enriched RNA-seq data, sophisticated analysis can reliably identify expressed genomic breakpoints and their transcriptional effects.  © 2021 The Author(s).","Gene Fusion; Genome; Genomics; RNA, Ribosomal; Sequence Analysis, RNA; cyclin dependent kinase 4; messenger RNA; minus RNA; mouse double minute 2 homolog; ribosome RNA; unclassified drug; ribosome RNA; Article; breast cancer; CCND1 gene; CDK4 gene; clinical article; comparative study; exon; female; gene deletion; gene expression; gene fusion; gene rearrangement; genetic code; genetic transcription; glioma; human; human cell; human tissue; intron; male; MDM2 gene; oncogene; polyadenylation; RNA sequencing; RNA splice site; TMPRSS2 ERG gene; whole genome sequencing; gene fusion; genome; genomics; sequence analysis","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122525676"

Additionally, P. larvata has the potential to carry a variety of zoonotic viruses that may threaten human health. However, genome resources for P. larvata have not been reported to date. Findings: A chromosome-level genome assembly of P. larvata was generated using PacBio sequencing, Illumina sequencing, and Hi-C technology. The genome assembly was 2.44 Gb in size, of which 95.32% could be grouped into 22 pseudochromosomes, with contig N50 and scaffold N50 values of 12.97 Mb and 111.81 Mb, respectively. A total of 21,582 protein-coding genes were predicted, and 95.20% of the predicted genes were functionally annotated. Phylogenetic analysis of 19 animal species confirmed the close genetic relationship between P. larvata and species belonging to the Felidae family. Gene family clustering revealed 119 unique, 243 significantly expanded, and 58 significantly contracted genes in the P. larvata genome. We identified 971 positively selected genes in P. larvata, and one known human viral receptor gene PDGFRA is positively selected in P. larvata, which is required for human cytomegalovirus infection. Conclusions: This high-quality genome assembly provides a valuable genomic resource for exploring virus-host interactions. It will also provide a reliable reference for studying the genetic bases of the morphologic characteristics, adaptive evolution, and evolutionary history of this species.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022","Animals; Chromosomes; Genome; Genomics; Phylogeny; Viverridae; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; DNA fragment; microRNA; small nuclear RNA; transfer RNA; amino acid sequence; animal experiment; Article; bootstrapping; computer analysis; cytomegalovirus infection; DNA extraction; DNA library; downstream processing; evolution; female; functional enrichment analysis; gene family evolution; gene mapping; genome assembly; genome size; hierarchical clustering; illumina sequencing; immune response; liver tissue; maximum likelihood method; molecular genetics; molecular phylogeny; multigene family; natural selection; nonhuman; pacbio sequencing; Paguma larvata; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; positive selection; prediction; quality control; RNA sequencing; sequence analysis; whole genome sequencing; animal; chromosome; genetics; genome; genomics; Viverridae","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130765891"

The approach presented here, integrated into the HiCExplorer software, shows a chromatin loop detection algorithm that applies a strict candidate selection based on continuous negative binomial distributions and performs a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to detect enriched Hi-C interactions. Results: HiCExplorer's loop detection has a high detection rate and accuracy. It is the fastest available CPU implementation and utilizes all threads offered by modern multicore platforms. Conclusions: HiCExplorer's method to detect loops by using a continuous negative binomial function combined with the donut approach from HiCCUPS leads to reliable and fast computation of loops. All the loop-calling algorithms investigated provide differing results, which intersect by $\sim 50\%$ at most. The tested in situ Hi-C data contain a large amount of noise; achieving better agreement between loop calling algorithms will require cleaner Hi-C data and therefore future improvements to the experimental methods that generate the data.  © 2022 The Author(s).

In particular, the molecular data enable novel species to be characterized and the information linked to those already observed to be increased with new genomics data. For this reason, the management and visualization of existing molecular data, and their related metadata, through the implementation of easy-to-use IT tools have become a key point to design future research. The more users are able to access biodiversity-related information, the greater the ability of the scientific community to expand its knowledge in this area. Results: In this article we focus on the development of ExTaxsI (Exploring Taxonomy Information), an IT tool that can retrieve biodiversity data stored in NCBI databases and provide a simple and explorable visualization. We use 3 case studies to show how an efficient organization of the available data can lead to obtaining new information that is fundamental as a starting point for new research. Using this approach highlights the limits in the distribution of data availability, a key factor to consider in the experimental design phase of broad-spectrum studies such as metagenomics.

The introduction of long-read sequencing technologies permits those contiguous sequences to be unambiguously bridged into complete genomes. However, the elevated costs associated with long-read sequencing frequently limit the number of bacterial isolates that can be long-read sequenced. Here we evaluated the recently released 96 barcoding kit from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to generate complete genomes on a high-throughput basis. In addition, we propose an isolate selection strategy that optimizes a representative selection of isolates for long-read sequencing considering as input large-scale bacterial collections. Results: Despite an uneven distribution of long reads per barcode, near-complete chromosomal sequences (assembly contiguity = 0.89) were generated for 96 Escherichia coli isolates with associated short-read sequencing data. The assembly contiguity of the plasmid replicons was even higher (0.98), which indicated the suitability of the multiplexing strategy for studies focused on resolving plasmid sequences. We benchmarked hybrid and ONT-only assemblies and showed that the combination of ONT sequencing data with short-read sequencing data is still highly desirable (i) to perform an unbiased selection of isolates for long-read sequencing, (ii) to achieve an optimal genome accuracy and completeness, and (iii) to include small plasmids underrepresented in the ONT library. Conclusions: The proposed long-read isolate selection ensures the completion of bacterial genomes that span the genome diversity inherent in large collections of bacterial isolates. We show the potential of using this multiplexing approach to close bacterial genomes on a high-throughput basis.  © 2021 The Author(s).","Gene Library; Genome, Bacterial; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Nanopores; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Article; bacterial genome; bacterium isolate; chromosome; clinical evaluation; computer model; controlled study; DNA isolation; Escherichia coli; gene isolation; gene library; gene synthesis; genetic selection; genetic variability; high throughput sequencing; large scale production; nanopore sequencing; nonhuman; process optimization; replicon; workflow; DNA sequence; high throughput sequencing; nanopore; procedures","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122502619"

As an economically and ecologically important nut tree, C. heterophylla can survive in extremely low temperatures (–30 to –40 ◦C). To deepen our knowledge of the Betulaceae species and facilitate the use of C. heterophylla for breeding and its genetic improvement, we have sequenced the whole genome of C. heterophylla. Findings: Based on >64.99 Gb (∼175.30×) of Nanopore long reads, we assembled a 370.75-Mb C. heterophylla genome with contig N50 and scaffold N50 sizes of 2.07 and 31.33 Mb, respectively, accounting for 99.23% of the estimated genome size (373.61 Mb). Furthermore, 361.90 Mb contigs were anchored to 11 chromosomes using Hi-C link data, representing 97.61% of the assembled genome sequences. Transcriptomes representing 4 different tissues were sequenced to assist protein-coding gene prediction. A total of 27,591 protein-coding genes were identified, of which 92.02% (25,389) were functionally annotated. The phylogenetic analysis showed that C. heterophylla is close to Ostrya japonica, and they diverged from their common ancestor ∼52.79 million years ago. Conclusions: We generated a high-quality chromosome-level genome of C. heterophylla. This genome resource will promote research on the molecular mechanisms of how the hazelnut responds to environmental stresses and serves as an important resource for genome-assisted improvement in cold and drought resistance of the Corylus genus. © The Author(s) 2021.

The genomes of venomous animals are essential to understand the evolutionary mechanisms involved in the origin and diversification of venoms. Results: Here, we report the chromosome-level genome of the venomous Mediterranean cone snail, Lautoconus ventricosus (Caenogastropoda: Conidae). The total size of the assembly is 3.59 Gb; it has high contiguity (N50 = 93.53 Mb) and 86.6 Mb of the genome assembled into the 35 largest scaffolds or pseudochromosomes. On the basis of venom gland transcriptomes, we annotated 262 complete genes encoding conotoxin precursors, hormones, and other venom-related proteins. These genes were scattered in the different pseudochromosomes and located within repetitive regions. The genes encoding conotoxin precursors were normally structured into 3 exons, which did not necessarily coincide with the 3 structural domains of the corresponding proteins. Additionally, we found evidence in the L. ventricosus genome for a past whole-genome duplication event by means of conserved gene synteny with the Pomacea canaliculata genome, the only one available at the chromosome level within Caenogastropoda. The whole-genome duplication event was further confirmed by the presence of a duplicated hox gene cluster. Key genes for gastropod biology including those encoding proteins related to development, shell formation, and sex were located in the genome. Conclusions: The new high-quality L. ventricosus genome should become a reference for assembling and analyzing new gastropod genomes and will contribute to future evolutionary genomic studies among venomous animals. © 2021 The Author(s).

The recent development of metagenome-wide association studies and other quantitative analysis methods accelerate the discovery of the associations between human microbiome and diseases. To assess the strengths and limitations of these analytical tools, simulating realistic microbiome datasets is critically important. However, simulating the real microbiome data is challenging because it is difficult to model their correlation structure using explicit statistical models. Results: To address the challenge of simulating realistic microbiome data, we designed a novel simulation framework termed MB-GAN, by using a generative adversarial network (GAN) and utilizing methodology advancements from the deep learning community. MB-GAN can automatically learn from given microbial abundances and compute simulated abundances that are indistinguishable from them. In practice, MB-GAN showed the following advantages. First, MB-GAN avoids explicit statistical modeling assumptions, and it only requires real datasets as inputs. Second, unlike the traditional GANs, MB-GAN is easily applicable and can converge efficiently. Conclusions: By applying MB-GAN to a case-control gut microbiome study of 396 samples, we demonstrated that the simulated data and the original data had similar first-order and second-order properties, including sparsity, diversities, and taxa-Taxa correlations. These advantages are suitable for further microbiome methodology development where high-fidelity microbiome data are needed.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Biochemical and mechanical factors residing in the tumor microenvironment are considered to play a pivotal role in metastatic growth and response to therapy. However, it is difficult to study the tumor microenvironment systematically owing to a lack of fully controlled model systems that can be investigated in rigorous detail. Results: We present a quantitative imaging dataset of CRC cell growth dynamics influenced by in vivo–mimicking conditions. They consist of tumor cells grown in various biochemical and biomechanical microenvironmental contexts. These contexts include varying oxygen and drug concentrations, and growth on conventional stiff plastic, softer matrices, and bioengineered acellular liver extracellular matrix. Growth rate analyses under these conditions were performed via the cell phenotype digitizer (CellPD). Conclusions: Our data indicate that the growth of highly aggressive HCT116 cells is affected by oxygen, substrate stiffness, and liver extracellular matrix. In addition, hypoxia has a protective effect against oxaliplatin-induced cytotoxicity on plastic and liver extracellular matrix. This expansive dataset of CRC cell growth measurements under in situ relevant environmental perturbations provides insights into critical tumor microenvironment features contributing to metastatic seeding and tumor growth. Such insights are essential to dynamical modeling and understanding the multicellular tumor-stroma dynamics that contribute to metastatic colonization. It also establishes a benchmark dataset for training and testing data-driven dynamical models of cancer cell lines and therapeutic response in a variety of microenvironmental conditions. © The Author(s) 2021.Published by Oxford University Press GigaScience.","Colorectal Neoplasms; Extracellular Matrix; Humans; Microscopy; Tumor Microenvironment; oxaliplatin; oxygen; plastic; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; biochemistry; bioengineering; biomechanics; cancer cell; cancer growth; cell growth; cell protection; clinical feature; colorectal cancer; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug concentration; extracellular matrix; growth rate; HCT 116 cell line; high content imaging; high throughput imaging; human; human cell; IC50; in vivo study; liver metastasis; longitudinal study; low drug dose; microscopy; nonhuman; phenotype; quantitative analysis; treatment response; tumor hypoxia; tumor microenvironment; tumor seeding; colorectal tumor; microscopy; tumor microenvironment","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105768607"

The objective of the initiative is to support a better understanding of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) and the development of machine learning technologies that will improve care for patients hospitalized with a severe COVID-19 infection. This article introduces the training dataset, including a snapshot analysis covering the completeness of clinical data, and availability of image data for the various use-cases (diagnosis, prognosis, longitudinal risk). An additional cohort analysis measures how well the NCCID represents the wider COVID-19-affected UK population in terms of geographic, demographic, and temporal coverage. Findings: The NCCID offers high-quality DICOM images acquired across a variety of imaging machinery; multiple time points including historical images are available for a subset of patients. This volume and variety make the database well suited to development of diagnostic/prognostic models for COVID-associated respiratory conditions. Historical images and clinical data may aid long-term risk stratification, particularly as availability of comorbidity data increases through linkage to other resources. The cohort analysis revealed good alignment to general UK COVID-19 statistics for some categories, e.g., sex, whilst identifying areas for improvements to data collection methods, particularly geographic coverage. Conclusion: The NCCID is a growing resource that provides researchers with a large, high-quality database that can be leveraged both to support the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and as a test bed for building clinically viable medical imaging models.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

CNVnator is one of the most popular tools for CNV/CNA discovery and analysis based on read depth. Findings: Herein, we present an extension of CNVnator developed in Python - CNVpytor. CNVpytor inherits the reimplemented core engine of its predecessor and extends visualization, modularization, performance, and functionality. Additionally, CNVpytor uses B-allele frequency likelihood information from single-nucleotide polymorphisms and small indels data as additional evidence for CNVs/CNAs and as primary information for copy number-neutral losses of heterozygosity. Conclusions: CNVpytor is significantly faster than CNVnator - particularly for parsing alignment files (2-20 times faster) - and has (20-50 times) smaller intermediate files. CNV calls can be filtered using several criteria, annotated, and merged over multiple samples. Modular architecture allows it to be used in shared and cloud environments such as Google Colab and Jupyter notebook. Data can be exported into JBrowse, while a lightweight plugin version of CNVpytor for JBrowse enables nearly instant and GUI-assisted analysis of CNVs by any user.

However, the limited information on its genome has impeded further related research and understanding of its adaptation to deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Findings: Here, we report the whole-genome sequencing and assembly of the scaly-foot snail and another snail (Gigantopelta aegis), which inhabits similar environments. Using Oxford Nanopore Technology, 10X Genomics, and Hi-C technologies, we obtained a chromosome-level genome of C. squamiferum with an N50 size of 20.71 Mb. By constructing a phylogenetic tree, we found that these 2 deep-sea snails evolved independently of other snails. Their divergence from each other occurred ∼66.3 million years ago. Comparative genomic analysis showed that different snails have diverse genome sizes and repeat contents. Deep-sea snails have more DNA transposons and long terminal repeats but fewer long interspersed nuclear elements than other snails. Gene family analysis revealed that deep-sea snails experienced stronger selective pressures than freshwater snails, and gene families related to the nervous system, immune system, metabolism, DNA stability, antioxidation, and biomineralization were significantly expanded in scaly-foot snails. We also found 251 H-2 Class II histocompatibility antigen, A-U α chain-like (H2-Aal) genes, which exist uniquely in the Gigantopelta aegis genome. This finding is important for investigating the evolution of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes.

Academic publishing improves data and metadata quality through peer review and increases the impact of datasets by enhancing their visibility, accessibility, and reusability. Objective: We aimed to establish a new type of article structure and template for omics studies: the omics data paper. To improve data interoperability and further incentivize researchers to publish well-described datasets, we created a prototype workflow for streamlined import of genomics metadata from the European Nucleotide Archive directly into a data paper manuscript. Methods: An omics data paper template was designed by defining key article sections that encourage the description of omics datasets and methodologies. A metadata import workflow, based on REpresentational State Transfer services and Xpath, was prototyped to extract information from the European Nucleotide Archive, ArrayExpress, and BioSamples databases. Findings: The template and workflow for automatic import of standard-compliant metadata into an omics data paper manuscript provide a mechanism for enhancing existing metadata through publishing. Conclusion: The omics data paper structure and workflow for import of genomics metadata will help to bring genomic and other omics datasets into the spotlight. Promoting enhanced metadata descriptions and enforcing manuscript peer review and data auditing of the underlying datasets brings additional quality to datasets.

However, comprehensive analysis of mutational data from MRS is still challenging, necessitating complicated integration of a plethora of computational and statistical approaches. Findings: Here, we present MesKit, an R/Bioconductor package that can assist in characterizing genetic ITH and tracing the evolutionary history of tumors based on somatic alterations detected by MRS. MesKit provides a wide range of analysis and visualization modules, including ITH evaluation, metastatic route inference, and mutational signature identification. In addition, MesKit implements an auto-layout algorithm to generate phylogenetic trees based on somatic mutations. The application of MesKit for 2 reported MRS datasets of hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer identified known heterogeneous features and evolutionary patterns, together with potential driver events during cancer evolution. Conclusions: In summary, MesKit is useful for interpreting ITH and tracing evolutionary trajectory based on MRS data.

Computational demultiplexing tools based on natural genetic variation between individuals provide a simple approach to demultiplex samples, which does not require complex additional experimental procedures. However, to our knowledge these tools have not been evaluated in cancer, where somatic variants, which could differ between cells from the same sample, may obscure the signal in natural genetic variation. Results: Here, we performed in silico benchmark evaluations by combining raw sequencing reads from multiple single-cell samples in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, which has a high copy number burden, and lung adenocarcinoma, which has a high tumor mutational burden. Our results confirm that genetic demultiplexing tools can be effectively deployed on cancer tissue using a pooled experimental design, although high proportions of ambient RNA from cell debris reduce performance. Conclusions: This strategy provides significant cost savings through pooled library preparation. To facilitate similar analyses at the experimental design phase, we provide freely accessible code and a reproducible Snakemake workflow built around the best-performing tools found in our in silico benchmark evaluations, available at https://github.com/lmweber/snp-dmx-cancer.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Previous work indicated that these reads are characterized by erroneous split-read support that is interpreted as evidence of structural variants. Thus, a large number of false-positive structural variants are detected. To our knowledge, no tool is currently available to specifically call or filter structural variants in FFPE samples. To overcome this gap, we developed 2 R packages: SimFFPE and FilterFFPE. Results: SimFFPE is a read simulator, specifically designed for next-generation sequencing data from FFPE samples. A mixture of characteristic artifact chimeric reads, as well as normal reads, is generated. FilterFFPE is a filtration algorithm, removing artifact chimeric reads from sequencing data while keeping real chimeric reads. To evaluate the performance of FilterFFPE, we performed structural variant calling with 3 common tools (Delly, Lumpy, and Manta) with and without prior filtration with FilterFFPE. After applying FilterFFPE, the mean positive predictive value improved from 0.27 to 0.48 in simulated samples and from 0.11 to 0.27 in real samples, while sensitivity remained basically unchanged or even slightly increased. Conclusions: FilterFFPE improves the performance of SV calling in FFPE samples. It was validated by analysis of simulated and real data.  © 2021 The Author(s).

The diversity of information used to describe life-scientific digital resources presents an obstacle to their utilization. Although several standardization efforts are emerging, no information schema has been sufficiently detailed to enable uniform semantic and syntactic description - and cataloguing - of bioinformatics resources. Findings: Here we describe biotoolsSchema, a formalized information model that balances the needs of conciseness for rapid adoption against the provision of rich technical information and scientific context. biotoolsSchema results from a series of community-driven workshops and is deployed in the bio.tools registry, providing the scientific community with >17,000 machine-readable and human-understandable descriptions of software and other digital life-science resources. We compare our approach to related initiatives and provide alignments to foster interoperability and reusability. Conclusions: biotoolsSchema supports the formalized, rigorous, and consistent specification of the syntax and semantics of bioinformatics resources, and enables cataloguing efforts such as bio.tools that help scientists to find, comprehend, and compare resources.

Phenotype libraries, where definitions are stored, have the potential to contribute significantly to the quality of the definitions they host. In this work, we present a set of desiderata for the design of a next-generation phenotype library that is able to ensure the quality of hosted definitions by combining the functionality currently offered by disparate tooling. Methods: A group of researchers examined work to date on phenotype models, implementation, and validation, as well as contemporary phenotype libraries developed as a part of their own phenomics communities. Existing phenotype frameworks were also examined. This work was translated and refined by all the authors into a set of best practices. Results: We present 14 library desiderata that promote high-quality phenotype definitions, in the areas of modelling, logging, validation, and sharing and warehousing. Conclusions: There are a number of choices to be made when constructing phenotype libraries. Our considerations distil the best practices in the field and include pointers towards their further development to support portable, reproducible, and clinically valid phenotype design.

Two factors that limit the usefulness and performance of fluorescence microscopy are photobleaching of fluorescent probes during imaging and, when imaging live cells, phototoxicity caused by light exposure. Recently developed methods in machine learning are able to greatly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of acquired images. This allows researchers to record images with much shorter exposure times, which in turn minimizes photobleaching and phototoxicity by reducing the dose of light reaching the sample. Findings: To use deep learning methods, a large amount of data is needed to train the underlying convolutional neural network. One way to do this involves use of pairs of fluorescence microscopy images acquired with long and short exposure times. We provide high-quality datasets that can be used to train and evaluate deep learning methods under development. Conclusion: The availability of high-quality data is vital for training convolutional neural networks that are used in current machine learning approaches. © 2021 The Author(s).

Although it has been reported that an ancient whole-genome duplication event occurred in spiders, lack of a high-quality genome has limited characterization of this event. Results: We present a chromosome-level T. antipodiana genome constructed on the basis of PacBio and Hi-C sequencing. The assembled genome is 2.29 Gb in size with a scaffold N50 of 172.89 Mb. Hi-C scaffolding assigned 98.5% of the bases to 13 pseudo-chromosomes, and BUSCO completeness analysis revealed that the assembly included 94.8% of the complete arthropod universal single-copy orthologs (n = 1,066). Repetitive elements account for 59.21% of the genome. We predicted 19,001 protein-coding genes, of which 96.78% were supported by transcriptome-based evidence and 96.32% matched protein records in the UniProt database. The genome also shows substantial expansions in several detoxification-associated gene families, including cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenases, carboxyl/cholinesterases, glutathione-S-transferases, and ATP-binding cassette transporters, reflecting the possible genomic basis of polyphagy. Further analysis of the T. antipodiana genome architecture reveals an ancient whole-genome duplication event, based on 2 lines of evidence: (i) large-scale duplications from inter-chromosome synteny analysis and (ii) duplicated clusters of Hox genes. Conclusions: The high-quality T. antipodiana genome represents a valuable resource for spider research and provides insights into this species' adaptation to the environment.  © 2021 The Author(s).","Animals; Chromosomes; Gene Duplication; Genome; Genomics; Humans; Spiders; ABC transporter; cholinesterase; cytochrome P450 monooxygenase; glutathione transferase; unclassified drug; ABC transporter gene; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; cholinesterase gene; chromosome analysis; cytochrome P450 monooxygenase gene; female; gene construct; gene duplication; gene sequence; genomics; glutathione transferase gene; Hox gene; insect genome; nonhuman; phylogeny; polyphagy; priority journal; synteny; Trichonephila; Trichonephila antipodiana; animal; chromosome; gene duplication; genetics; genome; human; spider","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103229412"

This move has been hailed as a positive step towards inclusivity in its attenuation of economic, physical, and legal barriers and effectively enabled many individuals from groups that have traditionally been underrepresented to join and participate. A number of studies have outlined how moving online made it possible to gather a more global community and has increased opportunities for individuals with various constraints, e.g., caregiving responsibilities. Yet, the mere existence of online conferences is no guarantee that everyone can attend and participate meaningfully. In fact, many elements of an online conference are still significant barriers to truly diverse participation: the tools used can be inaccessible for some individuals; the scheduling choices can favour some geographical locations; the set-up of the conference can provide more visibility to well-established researchers and reduce opportunities for early-career researchers. While acknowledging the benefits of an online setting, especially for individuals who have traditionally been underrepresented or excluded, we recognize that fostering social justice requires inclusivity to actively be centered in every aspect of online conference design. Here, we draw from the literature and from our own experiences to identify practices that purposefully encourage a diverse community to attend, participate in, and lead online conferences. Reflecting on how to design more inclusive online events is especially important as multiple scientific organizations have announced that they will continue offering an online version of their event when in-person conferences can resume.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

However, the complex structure of the microbiome in AD is poorly understood. Findings: In this study, we constructed a microbial gene catalog of AD (22,840,185 genes) based on 1,817 Gb metagenomic data derived from digestate samples of 56 full-scale biogas plants fed with diverse feedstocks. Among the gene catalog, 73.63% and 2.32% of genes were taxonomically annotated to Bacteria and Archaea, respectively, and 57.07% of genes were functionally annotated with KEGG orthologous groups. Our results confirmed the existence of core microbiome in AD and showed that the type of feedstock (cattle, chicken, and pig manure) has a great influence on carbohydrate hydrolysis and methanogenesis. In addition, 2,426 metagenome-assembled genomes were recovered from all digestate samples, and all genomes were estimated to be ≥80% complete with ≤10% contamination. Conclusions: This study deepens our understanding of the microbial composition and function in the AD process and also provides a huge number of reference genome and gene resources for analysis of anaerobic microbiota. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

This strategy not only allows access to the gene catalogue of a given species but also reveals the architecture and organization of chromosomes, including complex regions such as telomeres and centromeres. The Brassica genus is not exempt, and many assemblies based on long reads are now available. The reference genome for Brassica napus, Darmor-bzh, which was published in 2014, was produced using short reads and its contiguity was extremely low compared with current assemblies of the Brassica genus. Findings: Herein, we report the new long-read assembly of Darmor-bzh genome (Brassica napus) generated by combining long-read sequencing data and optical and genetic maps. Using the PromethION device and 6 flowcells, we generated ∼16 million long reads representing 93× coverage and, more importantly, 6× with reads longer than 100 kb. This ultralong-read dataset allows us to generate one of the most contiguous and complete assemblies of a Brassica genome to date (contig N50 > 10 Mb). In addition, we exploited all the advantages of the nanopore technology to detect modified bases and sequence transcriptomic data using direct RNA to annotate the genome and focus on resistance genes. Conclusion: Using these cutting-edge technologies, and in particular by relying on all the advantages of the nanopore technology, we provide the most contiguous Brassica napus assembly, a resource that will be valuable to the Brassica community for crop improvement and will facilitate the rapid selection of agronomically important traits.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Brassica napus; Genome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Nanopores; Phenotype; alternative RNA splicing; Article; centromere; controlled study; DNA transposon; exon skipping; gene location; gene mapping; genome size; intron retention; nanopore sequencing; nonhuman; plant chromosome; plant gene; plant genome; priority journal; rapeseed; RNA sequencing; genetics; genome; high throughput sequencing; nanopore; phenotype","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098475745"

However, current experimental methods of cell type quantification (e.g., cell flow cytometry) are costly, time consuming and have potential to introduce bias. Computational approaches that use expression data to infer cell type abundance offer an alternative solution. While these methods have gained popularity, most fail to produce accurate predictions for the full range of platforms currently used by researchers or for the wide variety of tissue types often studied. Results: We present the Gene Expression Deconvolution Interactive Tool (GEDIT), a flexible tool that utilizes gene expression data to accurately predict cell type abundances. Using both simulated and experimental data, we extensively evaluate the performance of GEDIT and demonstrate that it returns robust results under a wide variety of conditions. These conditions include multiple platforms (microarray and RNA-seq), tissue types (blood and stromal), and species (human and mouse). Finally, we provide reference data from 8 sources spanning a broad range of stromal and hematopoietic types in both human and mouse. GEDIT also accepts user-submitted reference data, thus allowing the estimation of any cell type or subtype, provided that reference data are available. Conclusions: GEDIT is a powerful method for evaluating the cell type composition of tissue samples and provides excellent accuracy and versatility compared to similar tools. The reference database provided here also allows users to obtain estimates for a wide variety of tissue samples without having to provide their own data.  © 2021 The Author(s).

The reads from these experiments usually are chimeric, with each arm generated from one of the interaction partners. Owing to short read lengths, often these sequenced arms ambiguously map to multiple locations. Thus, inferring the origin of these can be quite complicated. Here we present ChiRA, a generic framework for sensitive annotation of these chimeric reads, which in turn can be used to predict the sequenced hybrids. Results: Grouping reference loci on the basis of aligned common reads and quantification improved the handling of the multi-mapped reads in contrast to common strategies such as the selection of the longest hit or a random choice among all hits. On benchmark data ChiRA improved the number of correct alignments to the reference up to 3-fold. It is shown that the genes that belong to the common read loci share the same protein families or similar pathways. In published data, ChiRA could detect 3 times more new interactions compared to existing approaches. In addition, ChiRAViz can be used to visualize and filter large chimeric datasets intuitively. Conclusion: ChiRA tool suite provides a complete analysis and visualization framework along with ready-to-use Galaxy workflows and tutorials for RNA-RNA interactome and structurome datasets. Common read loci built by ChiRA can rescue multi-mapped reads on paralogous genes without requiring any information on gene relations.

Multiple competing technologies have been developed to improve the quality and robustness of genome assemblies during the past decade. The 2 widely used long-read sequencing providers-Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)-have recently updated their platforms: PacBio enables high-throughput HiFi reads with base-level resolution of >99%, and ONT generated reads as long as 2 Mb. We applied the 2 up-to-date platforms to a single rice individual and then compared the 2 assemblies to investigate the advantages and limitations of each. Results The results showed that ONT ultralong reads delivered higher contiguity, producing a total of 18 contigs of which 10 were assembled into a single chromosome compared to 394 contigs and 3 chromosome-level contigs for the PacBio assembly. The ONT ultralong reads also prevented assembly errors caused by long repetitive regions, for which we observed a total of 44 genes of false redundancies and 10 genes of false losses in the PacBio assembly, leading to over- or underestimation of the gene families in those long repetitive regions. We also noted that the PacBio HiFi reads generated assemblies with considerably fewer errors at the level of single nucleotides and small insertions and deletions than those of the ONT assembly, which generated an average 1.06 errors per kb and finally engendered 1,475 incorrect gene annotations via altered or truncated protein predictions. Conclusions It shows that both PacBio HiFi reads and ONT ultralong reads had their own merits. Further genome reference constructions could leverage both techniques to lessen the impact of assembly errors and subsequent annotation mistakes rooted in each.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Genome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Nanopores; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Article; chromosome; contig mapping; gene sequence; genome; indel mutation; multigene family; nanopore sequencing; nonhuman; priority journal; rice; sequence analysis; DNA sequence; genome; high throughput sequencing; human; molecular genetics; nanopore","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098476158"

One of the challenges of using ridge regression is the need to set a hyperparameter (α) that controls the amount of regularization. Cross-validation is typically used to select the best α from a set of candidates. However, efficient and appropriate selection of α can be challenging. This becomes prohibitive when large amounts of data are analyzed. Because the selected α depends on the scale of the data and correlations across predictors, it is also not straightforwardly interpretable. Results: The present work addresses these challenges through a novel approach to ridge regression. We propose to reparameterize ridge regression in terms of the ratio γ between the L2-norms of the regularized and unregularized coefficients. We provide an algorithm that efficiently implements this approach, called fractional ridge regression, as well as open-source software implementations in Python and MATLAB (https://github.com/nrdg/fracridge). We show that the proposed method is fast and scalable for large-scale data problems. In brain imaging data, we demonstrate that this approach delivers results that are straightforward to interpret and compare across models and datasets. Conclusion: Fractional ridge regression has several benefits: the solutions obtained for different γ are guaranteed to vary, guarding against wasted calculations; and automatically span the relevant range of regularization, avoiding the need for arduous manual exploration. These properties make fractional ridge regression particularly suitable for analysis of large complex datasets.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Algorithms; Brain; Linear Models; Software; algorithm; article; brain; calculation; data analysis software; brain; software; statistical model","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097004368"

Results: Here we analyzed 19 parent-offspring trios of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) at high sequencing coverage of ∼76× per individual and estimated a mean rate of 0.77 × 10-8 de novo mutations per site per generation (95% CI: 0.69 × 10-8 to 0.85 × 10-8). By phasing 50% of the mutations to parental origins, we found that the mutation rate is positively correlated with the paternal age. The paternal lineage contributed a mean of 81% of the de novo mutations, with a trend of an increasing male contribution for older fathers. Approximately 3.5% of de novo mutations were shared between siblings, with no parental bias, suggesting that they arose from early development (postzygotic) stages. Finally, the divergence times between closely related primates calculated on the basis of the yearly mutation rate of rhesus macaque generally reconcile with divergence estimated with molecular clock methods, except for the Cercopithecoidea/Hominoidea molecular divergence dated at 58 Mya using our new estimate of the yearly mutation rate. Conclusions: When compared to the traditional molecular clock methods, new estimated rates from pedigree samples can provide insights into the evolution of well-studied groups such as primates. © 2021 The Author(s).

We propose a pipeline model, a design pattern for scientific pipelines, where an incoming stream of scientific data is organized into a tiered or ordered ""data hierarchy"". We introduce the HASTE Toolkit, a proof-of-concept cloud-native software toolkit based on this pipeline model, to partition and prioritize data streams to optimize use of limited computing resources. Findings: In our pipeline model, an ""interestingness function""assigns an interestingness score to data objects in the stream, inducing a data hierarchy. From this score, a ""policy""guides decisions on how to prioritize computational resource use for a given object. The HASTE Toolkit is a collection of tools to adopt this approach. We evaluate with 2 microscopy imaging case studies. The first is a high content screening experiment, where images are analyzed in an on-premise container cloud to prioritize storage and subsequent computation. The second considers edge processing of images for upload into the public cloud for real-time control of a transmission electron microscope. Conclusions: Through our evaluation, we created smart data pipelines capable of effective use of storage, compute, and network resources, enabling more efficient data-intensive experiments. We note a beneficial separation between scientific concerns of data priority, and the implementation of this behaviour for different resources in different deployment contexts. The toolkit allows intelligent prioritization to be 'bolted on' to new and existing systems - and is intended for use with a range of technologies in different deployment scenarios.  © 2021 The Author(s).","Biological Science Disciplines; Diagnostic Imaging; Software; Article; cloud computing; computer analysis; data analysis software; HASTE Toolkit; image analysis; information processing; microscopy; scientific literature; biomedicine; diagnostic imaging; software","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103229403"

The predicted binding sites are often further analyzed to predict sequence motifs or structure patterns. When looking at a typical result of such high-throughput experiments, the obtained peak profiles differ largely on a genomic level. Thus, a tool is missing that evaluates and classifies the predicted peaks on the basis of their shapes. We hereby present StoatyDive, a tool that can be used to filter for specific peak profile shapes of sequencing data such as CLIP. Findings: With StoatyDive we are able to classify peak profile shapes from CLIP-seq data of the histone stem-loop-binding protein (SLBP). We compare the results to existing tools and show that StoatyDive finds more distinct peak shape clusters for CLIP data. Furthermore, we present StoatyDive's capabilities as a quality control tool and as a filter to pick different shapes based on biological or technical questions for other CLIP data from different RNA binding proteins with different biological functions and numbers of RNA recognition motifs. We finally show that proteins involved in splicing, such as RBM22 and U2AF1, have potentially sharper-shaped peaks than other RNA binding proteins. Conclusion: StoatyDive finally fills the demand for a peak shape clustering tool for CLIP-Seq data that fine-tunes downstream analysis steps such as structure or sequence motif predictions and that acts as a quality control.  © 2021 The Author(s).","Binding Sites; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Immunoprecipitation; RNA; Sequence Analysis, RNA; messenger RNA; RNA binding protein; RNA; accuracy; Article; binding affinity; binding site; calculation; correlation coefficient; data analysis; data base; exon; high throughput sequencing; information processing; mathematical analysis; prediction; protein function; protein protein interaction; immunoprecipitation; sequence analysis","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108674613"

Consequently, machine learning algorithms lose accuracy because they do not know these new patterns. This change in the data pattern is known as concept drift. There exist many approaches for dealing with these drifts. Usually, these methods are costly to implement because they require (i) knowledge of drift detection algorithms, (ii) software engineering strategies, and (iii) continuous maintenance concerning new drifts. Results: This article proposes to create Driftage: a new framework using multi-agent systems to simplify the implementation of concept drift detectors considerably and divide concept drift detection responsibilities between agents, enhancing explainability of each part of drift detection. As a case study, we illustrate our strategy using a muscle activity monitor of electromyography. We show a reduction in the number of false-positive drifts detected, improving detection interpretability, and enabling concept drift detectors' interactivity with other knowledge bases. Conclusion: We conclude that using Driftage, arises a new paradigm to implement concept drift algorithms with multi-agent architecture that contributes to split drift detection responsability, algorithms interpretability and more dynamic algorithms adaptation. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

It offers unique perspectives for the examination of entire organs or other tissue specimens. Owing to increasing capabilities of modern MSI devices, the use of 3D and multi-modal MSI becomes feasible in routine applications-resulting in hundreds of gigabytes of data. To fully leverage such MSI acquisitions, interactive tools for 3D image reconstruction, visualization, and analysis are required, which preferably should be open-source to allow scientists to develop custom extensions. Findings: We introduce M2aia (MSI applications for interactive analysis in MITK), a software tool providing interactive and memory-efficient data access and signal processing of multiple large MSI datasets stored in imzML format. M2aia extends MITK, a popular open-source tool in medical image processing. Besides the steps of a typical signal processing workflow, M2aia offers fast visual interaction, image segmentation, deformable 3D image reconstruction, and multi-modal registration. A unique feature is that fused data with individual mass axes can be visualized in a shared coordinate system. We demonstrate features of M2aia by reanalyzing an N-glycan mouse kidney dataset and 3D reconstruction and multi-modal image registration of a lipid and peptide dataset of a mouse brain, which we make publicly available. Conclusions: To our knowledge, M2aia is the first extensible open-source application that enables a fast, user-friendly, and interactive exploration of large datasets.

Chromosome-level genome information of this species will contribute not only to the development of hard-shelled mussel genetic breeding but also to studies on larval ecology, climate change biology, marine biology, aquaculture, biofouling, and antifouling. Findings: We applied a combination of Illumina sequencing, Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing, and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture technologies to construct a chromosome-level genome of the hard-shelled mussel, with a total length of 1.57 Gb and a median contig length of 1.49 Mb. Approximately 90.9% of the assemblies were anchored to 14 linkage groups. We assayed the genome completeness using BUSCO. In the metazoan dataset, the present assemblies have 89.4% complete, 1.9% incomplete, and 8.7% missing BUSCOs. Gene modeling enabled the annotation of 37,478 protein-coding genes and 26,917 non-coding RNA loci. Phylogenetic analysis showed that M. coruscus is the sister taxon to the clade including Modiolus philippinarum and Bathymodiolus platifrons. Conserved chromosome synteny was observed between hard-shelled mussel and king scallop, suggesting that this is shared ancestrally. Transcriptomic profiling indicated that the pathways of catecholamine biosynthesis and adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes might be involved in metamorphosis. Conclusions: The chromosome-level assembly of the hard-shelled mussel genome will provide novel insights into mussel genome evolution and serve as a fundamental platform for studies regarding the planktonic-sessile transition, genetic diversity, and genomic breeding of this bivalve. © The Author(s) 2021.

Microbial ecologists often have expert knowledge on their biological question and data analysis in general, and most research institutes have computational infrastructures to use the bioinformatics command line tools and workflows for amplicon sequencing analysis, but requirements of bioinformatics skills often limit the efficient and up-to-date use of computational resources. Results: We present dadasnake, a user-friendly, 1-command Snakemake pipeline that wraps the preprocessing of sequencing reads and the delineation of exact sequence variants by using the favorably benchmarked and widely used DADA2 algorithm with a taxonomic classification and the post-processing of the resultant tables, including hand-off in standard formats. The suitability of the provided default configurations is demonstrated using mock community data from bacteria and archaea, as well as fungi. Conclusions: By use of Snakemake, dadasnake makes efficient use of high-performance computing infrastructures. Easy user configuration guarantees flexibility of all steps, including the processing of data from multiple sequencing platforms.

To predict the phenotypic impact of SVs, there is a need for better estimates of both the occurrence and frequency of SVs, preferably from large, ethnically diverse cohorts. Thus, the current standard approach requires the use of short paired-end reads, which remain challenging to detect, especially at the scale of hundreds to thousands of samples. Findings: We present Parliament2, a consensus SV framework that leverages multiple best-in-class methods to identify high-quality SVs from short-read DNA sequence data at scale. Parliament2 incorporates pre-installed SV callers that are optimized for efficient execution in parallel to reduce the overall runtime and costs. We demonstrate the accuracy of Parliament2 when applied to data from NovaSeq and HiSeq X platforms with the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) SV call set across all size classes. The reported quality score per SV is calibrated across different SV types and size classes. Parliament2 has the highest F1 score (74.27%) measured across the independent gold standard from GIAB. We illustrate the compute performance by processing all 1000 Genomes samples (2,691 samples) in <1 day on GRCH38. Parliament2 improves the runtime performance of individual methods and is open source (https://github.com/slzarate/parliament2), and a Docker image, as well as a WDL implementation, is available. Conclusion: Parliament2 provides both a highly accurate single-sample SV call set from short-read DNA sequence data and enables cost-efficient application over cloud or cluster environments, processing thousands of samples.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Genome, Human; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Sequence Analysis; Software; Article; DNA sequence; ethnicity; genetic variation; genome analysis; human; priority journal; sequence analysis; software; genomics; high throughput sequencing; human genome; software","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098924524"

However, it relies on gene expression, which can be highly variable between conditions and thus cannot provide a complete picture of the RBP binding landscape. This creates a demand for computational methods to predict missing binding sites. Although there exist various methods using traditional machine learning and lately also deep learning, we encountered several problems: many of these are not well documented or maintained, making them difficult to install and use, or are not even available. In addition, there can be efficiency issues, as well as little flexibility regarding options or supported features. Results: Here, we present RNAProt, an efficient and feature-rich computational RBP binding site prediction framework based on recurrent neural networks. We compare RNAProt with 1 traditional machine learning approach and 2 deep-learning methods, demonstrating its state-of-the-art predictive performance and better run time efficiency. We further show that its implemented visualizations capture known binding preferences and thus can help to understand what is learned. Since RNAProt supports various additional features (including user-defined features, which no other tool offers), we also present their influence on benchmark set performance. Finally, we show the benefits of incorporating additional features, specifically structure information, when learning the binding sites of an hairpin loop binding RBP. Conclusions: RNAProt provides a complete framework for RBP binding site predictions, from data set generation over model training to the evaluation of binding preferences and prediction. It offers state-of-the-art predictive performance, as well as superior run time efficiency, while at the same time supporting more features and input types than any other tool available so far. RNAProt is easy to install and use, comes with comprehensive documentation, and is accompanied by informative statistics and visualizations. All this makes RNAProt a valuable tool to apply in future RBP binding site research. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Specifically regarding both shotgun- and metabarcoding-based metagenomics, while online reference databases and user-friendly tools exist for running various types of analyses (e.g., Qiime, Mothur, Megan, IMG/VR, Anvi'o, Qiita, MetaVir), scientists lack comprehensive software for easily building scalable, searchable, online data repositories on which they can rely during their ongoing research. Results: metaXplor is a scalable, distributable, fully web-interfaced application for managing, sharing, and exploring metagenomic data. Being based on a flexible NoSQL data model, it has few constraints regarding dataset contents and thus proves useful for handling outputs from both shotgun and metabarcoding techniques. By supporting incremental data feeding and providing means to combine filters on all imported fields, it allows for exhaustive content browsing, as well as rapid narrowing to find specific records. The application also features various interactive data visualization tools, ways to query contents by BLASTing external sequences, and an integrated pipeline to enrich assignments with phylogenetic placements. The project home page provides the URL of a live instance allowing users to test the system on public data. Conclusion: metaXplor allows efficient management and exploration of metagenomic data.

While unmapped or non-exonic reads do not contribute to gene expression quantification, duplicate reads contribute to the quantification but are not informative for reproducibility. We show that mapped, exonic, non-duplicate (MEND) reads are a useful measure of reproducibility of RNA-Seq datasets used for gene expression analysis. Findings: In bulk RNA-Seq datasets from 2,179 tumors in 48 cohorts, the fraction of reads that contribute to the reproducibility of gene expression analysis varies greatly. Unmapped reads constitute 1-77% of all reads (median [IQR], 3% [3-6%]); duplicate reads constitute 3-100% of mapped reads (median [IQR], 27% [13-43%]); and non-exonic reads constitute 4-97% of mapped, non-duplicate reads (median [IQR], 25% [16-37%]). MEND reads constitute 0-79% of total reads (median [IQR], 50% [30-61%]). Conclusions: Because not all reads in an RNA-Seq dataset are informative for reproducibility of gene expression measurements and the fraction of reads that are informative varies, we propose reporting a dataset's sequencing depth in MEND reads, which definitively inform the reproducibility of gene expression, rather than total, mapped, or exonic reads. We provide a Docker image containing (i) the existing required tools (RSeQC, sambamba, and samblaster) and (ii) a custom script to calculate MEND reads from RNA-Seq data files. We recommend that all RNA-Seq gene expression experiments, sensitivity studies, and depth recommendations use MEND units for sequencing depth.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Although these medically important Rickettsia are often transmitted via haematophagous arthropods, other Rickettsia, such as those in the Torix group, appear to reside exclusively in invertebrates and protists with no secondary vertebrate host. Importantly, little is known about the diversity or host range of Torix group Rickettsia. Results: This study describes the serendipitous discovery of Rickettsia amplicons in the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD), a sequence database specifically designed for the curation of mitochondrial DNA barcodes. Of 184,585 barcode sequences analysed, Rickettsia is observed in ∼0.41% of barcode submissions and is more likely to be found than Wolbachia (0.17%). The Torix group of Rickettsia are shown to account for 95% of all unintended amplifications from the genus. A further targeted PCR screen of 1,612 individuals from 169 terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate species identified mostly Torix strains and supports the ""aquatic hot spot""hypothesis for Torix infection. Furthermore, the analysis of 1,341 SRA deposits indicates that Torix infections represent a significant proportion of all Rickettsia symbioses found in arthropod genome projects. Conclusions: This study supports a previous hypothesis that suggests that Torix Rickettsia are overrepresented in aquatic insects. In addition, multiple methods reveal further putative hot spots of Torix Rickettsia infection, including in phloem-feeding bugs, parasitoid wasps, spiders, and vectors of disease. The unknown host effects and transmission strategies of these endosymbionts make these newly discovered associations important to inform future directions of investigation involving the understudied Torix Rickettsia.  © 2021 The Author(s).","Animals; Arthropods; Base Sequence; Humans; Phylogeny; Rickettsia; Symbiosis; mitochondrial DNA; amplicon; aquatic invertebrate; arthropod; Article; bacterial strain; DNA barcoding; DNA sequence; endosymbiont; gene amplification; genus; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; Rickettsia; Rickettsiaceae infection; symbiosis; terrestrial invertebrate; Torix Rickettsia; Wolbachia; animal; genetics; human; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; symbiosis","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103491893"

SV genotypers that assume that the aligned sequencing data uniformly reflect the underlying SV or use existing SV call sets as training data can only partially account for variant and sample-specific biases. Results: We introduce NPSV, a machine learning-based approach for genotyping previously discovered SVs that uses next-generation sequencing simulation to model the combined effects of the genomic region, sequencer, and alignment pipeline on the observed SV evidence. We evaluate NPSV alongside existing SV genotypers on multiple benchmark call sets. We show that NPSV consistently achieves or exceeds state-of-the-art genotyping accuracy across SV call sets, samples, and variant types. NPSV can specifically identify putative de novo SVs in a trio context and is robust to offset SV breakpoints. Conclusions: Growing SV databases and the increasing availability of SV calls from long-read sequencing make stand-alone genotyping of previously identified SVs an increasingly important component of genome analyses. By treating potential biases as a ""black box""that can be simulated, NPSV provides a framework for accurately genotyping a broad range of SVs in both targeted and genome-scale applications.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

However, existing tools often require programming ability and frequent user intervention that may not be suitable for fast-paced and large-scale data analysis by end user microbiologists who are unfamiliar with the Linux command line environment or who prefer interactions with a GUI. Here we present AXIOME3, which is a completely redeveloped AXIOME pipeline that streamlines small subunit ribosomal RNA data analysis by managing QIIME2, R, and Python-Associated analyses through an interactive web interface. Findings: AXIOME3 comes with web GUI to improve usability by simplifying configuration processes and task status tracking. Internally, it uses an automated pipeline that is wrapped around QIIME2 to generate a range of outputs including amplicon sequence variant tables, taxonomic classifications, phylogenetic trees, biodiversity metrics, and ordinations. The extension module for AXIOME3 provides advanced data visualization tools such as principal coordinate analysis, bubble plots, and triplot ordinations that can be used to visualize interactions between a distance matrix, amplicon sequence variant taxonomy, and sample metadata. Conclusions: Because repeat analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNA amplicon sequence data is challenging for those who have limited experience in command line environments, AXIOME3 now offers rapid and user-friendly options within an automated pipeline, with advanced data visualization tools and the ability for users to incorporate additional analyses easily through extension.

Unfortunately, metadata formats from a data provider are often incompatible with requirements of a processing tool. There is no broadly accepted standard to organize metadata across biological projects and bioinformatics tools, restricting the portability and reusability of both annotated datasets and analysis software. Results: To address this, we present the Portable Encapsulated Project (PEP) specification, a formal specification for biological sample metadata structure. The PEP specification accommodates typical features of data-intensive bioinformatics projects with many biological samples. In addition to standardization, the PEP specification provides descriptors and modifiers for project-level and sample-level metadata, which improve portability across both computing environments and data processing tools. PEPs include a schema validator framework, allowing formal definition of required metadata attributes for data analysis broadly. We have implemented packages for reading PEPs in both Python and R to provide a language-agnostic interface for organizing project metadata.

Mutant acquisition depends on the efficiency of mutation technology and screening methods. CRISPR-Cas9 technology is an efficient gene editing technology mainly used for editing a few genes or target sites, which has not been applied for the construction of random mutant libraries and for the de novo discovery of functional genes. Results: In this study, we first sequenced and assembled the chromosome-level genome of wild-type rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) as a susceptible model of hemorrhagic disease, obtained a 956.05 Mb genome sequence, assembled the sequence into 25 chromosomes, and annotated 26,861 protein-coding genes. Thereafter, CRISPR-Cas9 technology was applied to randomly mutate the whole genome of rare minnow with the conserved bases (TATAWAW and ATG) of the promoter and coding regions as the target sites. The survival rate of hemorrhagic disease in the rare minnow gradually increased from 0% (the entire wild-type population died after infection) to 38.24% (F3 generation). Finally, 7 susceptible genes were identified via genome comparative analysis and cell-level verification based on the rare minnow genome. Conclusions: The results provided the genomic resources for wild-type rare minnow, and confirmed that the random mutation system designed using CRISPR-Cas9 technology in this study is simple and efficient and is suitable for the de novo discovery of functional genes and creation of a germplasm resource related to qualitative traits.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Results: We identified substantial differences between the diversity, composition, and predicted function of site-associated microbiota. Differences in reproductive tract microbiota were more strongly associated with egg production than those in the digestive tract. We identified 4 reproductive tract microbial species, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides salanitronis, Bacteroides barnesiae, and Clostridium leptum, that were related to immune function and potentially contribute to enhanced egg production.

To maximize the potential of long-read sequencing in this context, novel mapping methods have emerged that have primarily focused on either speed or accuracy. Various heuristics and scoring schemas have been implemented in widely used read mappers (minimap2 and NGMLR) to optimize for speed or accuracy, which have variable performance across different genomic regions and for specific structural variants. Our hypothesis is that constraining read mapping to the use of a single gap penalty across distinct mutational hot spots reduces read alignment accuracy and impedes structural variant detection. Findings: We tested our hypothesis by implementing a read-mapping pipeline called Vulcan that uses two distinct gap penalty modes, which we refer to as dual-mode alignment. The high-level idea is that Vulcan leverages the computed normalized edit distance of the mapped reads via minimap2 to identify poorly aligned reads and realigns them using the more accurate yet computationally more expensive long-read mapper (NGMLR). In support of our hypothesis, we show that Vulcan improves the alignments for Oxford Nanopore Technology long reads for both simulated and real datasets. These improvements, in turn, lead to improved accuracy for structural variant calling performance on human genome datasets compared to either of the read-mapping methods alone. Conclusions: Vulcan is the first long-read mapping framework that combines two distinct gap penalty modes for improved structural variant recall and precision.

However, many genomes have not been investigated for their quality. Here we examine quality trends in a taxonomically diverse and well-known group, butterflies (Papilionoidea), and provide draft, de novo assemblies for all available butterfly genomes. Owing to massive genome sequencing investment and taxonomic curation, this is an excellent group to explore genome quality. Findings: We provide de novo assemblies for all 822 available butterfly genomes and interpret their quality in terms of completeness and continuity. We identify the 50 highest quality genomes across butterflies and conclude that the ringlet, Aphantopus hyperantus, has the highest quality genome. Our post-processing of draft genome assemblies identified 118 butterfly genomes that should not be reused owing to contamination or extremely low quality. However, many draft genomes are of high utility, especially because permissibility of low-quality genomes is dependent on the objective of the study. Our assemblies will serve as a key resource for papilionid genomics, especially for researchers without computational resources. Conclusions: Quality metrics and assemblies are typically presented with annotated genome accessions but rarely with de novo genomes. We recommend that studies presenting genome sequences provide the assembly and some metrics of quality because quality will significantly affect downstream results.

Microscopy is the most common method for diagnosing the malaria parasite from stained blood smear samples. However, this technique is time consuming and must be performed by a well-trained professional, yet it remains prone to errors. Distinguishing the multiple growth stages of parasites remains an especially challenging task. Results: In this article, we develop a novel deep learning approach for the recognition of malaria parasites of various stages in blood smear images using a deep transfer graph convolutional network (DTGCN). To our knowledge, this is the first application of graph convolutional network (GCN) on multi-stage malaria parasite recognition in such images. The proposed DTGCN model is based on unsupervised learning by transferring knowledge learnt from source images that contain the discriminative morphology characteristics of multi-stage malaria parasites. This transferred information guarantees the effectiveness of the target parasite recognition. This approach first learns the identical representations from the source to establish topological correlations between source class groups and the unlabelled target samples. At this stage, the GCN is implemented to extract graph feature representations for multi-stage malaria parasite recognition. The proposed method showed higher accuracy and effectiveness in publicly available microscopic images of multi-stage malaria parasites compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, this method is also evaluated on a large-scale dataset of unseen malaria parasites and the Babesia dataset.  © 2021 The Author(s).","Animals; Deep Learning; Humans; Malaria; Parasites; accuracy; Article; blood smear; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; convolutional neural network; correlational study; data base; deep learning; deep transfer graph convolutional network; image analysis; information dissemination; knowledge; medical education; medical information; microscopy; morphology; nonhuman; parasite identification; Plasmodium; unsupervised machine learning; animal; human; malaria; parasite","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108741381"

A good biomarker is one that gives reliable detection of the corresponding condition. However, biomarkers are often extracted from a cohort that differs from the target population. Such a mismatch, known as a dataset shift, can undermine the application of the biomarker to new individuals. Dataset shifts are frequent in biomedical research, e.g., because of recruitment biases. When a dataset shift occurs, standard machine-learning techniques do not suffice to extract and validate biomarkers.

Processing bisulfite sequencing data is often challenging owing to the computational demands of mapping a low-complexity, asymmetrical library and the lack of a unified processing toolset to produce an analysis-ready methylation matrix from read alignments. To address these shortcomings, we have developed BiSulfite Bolt (BSBolt), a fast and scalable bisulfite sequencing analysis platform. BSBolt performs a pre-alignment sequencing read assessment step to improve efficiency when handling asymmetrical bisulfite sequencing libraries. Findings: We evaluated BSBolt against simulated and real bisulfite sequencing libraries. We found that BSBolt provides accurate and fast bisulfite sequencing alignments and methylation calls. We also compared BSBolt to several existing bisulfite alignment tools and found BSBolt outperforms Bismark, BSSeeker2, BISCUIT, and BWA-Meth based on alignment accuracy and methylation calling accuracy. Conclusion: BSBolt offers streamlined processing of bisulfite sequencing data through an integrated toolset that offers support for simulation, alignment, methylation calling, and data aggregation. BSBolt is implemented as a Python package and command line utility for flexibility when building informatics pipelines.

Advances in long-read DNA sequencing make it feasible to generate high-quality genomes for many non-genetic model species. However, long-read sequencing today relies on sizable quantities of high-quality, high molecular weight DNA, which is mostly obtained from fresh tissues. This is a challenge for biodiversity genomics of most metazoan species, which are tiny and need to be preserved immediately after collection. Here we present de novo genomes of 2 species of submillimeter Collembola. For each, we prepared the sequencing library from high molecular weight DNA extracted from a single specimen and using a novel ultra-low input protocol from Pacific Biosciences. This protocol requires a DNA input of only 5 ng, permitted by a whole-genome amplification step. Results: The 2 assembled genomes have N50 values >5.5 and 8.5 Mb, respectively, and both contain ∼96% of BUSCO genes. Thus, they are highly contiguous and complete. The genomes are supported by an integrative taxonomy approach including placement in a genome-based phylogeny of Collembola and designation of a neotype for 1 of the species. Higher heterozygosity values are recorded in the more mobile species. Both species are devoid of the biosynthetic pathway for β-lactam antibiotics known in several Collembola, confirming the tight correlation of antibiotic synthesis with the species way of life. Conclusions: It is now possible to generate high-quality genomes from single specimens of minute, field-preserved metazoans, exceeding the minimum contig N50 (1 Mb) required by the Earth BioGenome Project. © 2021 The Author(s).

These modern imaging techniques used to interrogate the brain can quickly accumulate gigabytes to petabytes of structural brain imaging data. Unfortunately, many neuroscience laboratories lack the computational resources to work with datasets of this size: computer vision tools are often not portable or scalable, and there is considerable difficulty in reproducing results or extending methods. Results: We developed an ecosystem of neuroimaging data analysis pipelines that use open-source algorithms to create standardized modules and end-to-end optimized approaches. As exemplars we apply our tools to estimate synapse-level connectomes from electron microscopy data and cell distributions from X-ray microtomography data. To facilitate scientific discovery, we propose a generalized processing framework, which connects and extends existing open-source projects to provide large-scale data storage, reproducible algorithms, and workflow execution engines.

One mechanism by which synonymous codons direct and modulate the translational process is through alteration of the elaborate structure formed by single-stranded mRNA molecules. While tools to computationally predict the effect of non-synonymous variants on protein structure are plentiful, analogous tools to systematically assess how synonymous variants might disrupt mRNA structure are lacking. Results: We developed novel software using a parallel processing framework for large-scale generation of secondary RNA structures and folding statistics for the transcriptome of any species. Focusing our analysis on the human transcriptome, we calculated 5 billion RNA-folding statistics for 469 million single-nucleotide variants in 45,800 transcripts. By considering the impact of all possible synonymous variants globally, we discover that synonymous variants predicted to disrupt mRNA structure have significantly lower rates of incidence in the human population. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that synonymous variants may play a role in genetic disorders due to their effects on mRNA structure. To evaluate the potential pathogenic impact of synonymous variants, we provide RNA stability, edge distance, and diversity metrics for every nucleotide in the human transcriptome and introduce a ""Structural Predictivity Index""(SPI) to quantify structural constraint operating on any synonymous variant. Because no single RNA-folding metric can capture the diversity of mechanisms by which a variant could alter secondary mRNA structure, we generated a SUmmarized RNA Folding (SURF) metric to provide a single measurement to predict the impact of secondary structure altering variants in human genetic studies.  © 2021 The Author(s).

H3K27M mutation timing and effect on early embryonic brain development are not fully characterized. Results: We analyzed multiple publicly available RNA sequencing datasets to identify differentially expressed genes between H3K27M and non-K27M pediatric gliomas. We found that genes involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were significantly overrepresented among differentially expressed genes. Overall, the expression of pre-EMT genes was increased in the H3K27M tumors as compared to non-K27M tumors, while the expression of post-EMT genes was decreased. We hypothesized that H3K27M may contribute to gliomagenesis by stalling an EMT required for early brain development, and evaluated this hypothesis by using another publicly available dataset of single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data from developing cerebral organoids. This analysis revealed similarities between H3K27M tumors and pre-EMT normal brain cells. Finally, a previously published single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of H3K27M and non-K27M gliomas revealed subgroups of cells at different stages of EMT. In particular, H3.1K27M tumors resemble a later EMT stage compared to H3.3K27M tumors. Conclusions: Our data analyses indicate that this mutation may be associated with a differentiation stall evident from the failure to proceed through the EMT-like developmental processes, and that H3K27M cells preferentially exist in a pre-EMT cell phenotype. This study demonstrates how novel biological insights could be derived from combined analysis of several previously published datasets, highlighting the importance of making genomic data available to the community in a timely manner.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Cell Differentiation; Child; Child, Preschool; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Glioma; Histones; Humans; Mutation; histone H3; histone H3 lysine 27; lysine; RNA; unclassified drug; histone; adolescent; adult; Article; brain cell; cell differentiation; cerebral organoid; child; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene; gene expression; glioma; human; human cell; human tissue; infant; mutant; newborn; pathogenesis; phenotype; priority journal; RNA sequencing; single cell RNA seq; cell differentiation; epithelial mesenchymal transition; genetics; glioma; mutation; preschool child","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098475899"

Through the use of these datasets we can infer the role of previously functionally unannotated proteins from single organisms and consortia. In this context, protein function annotation can be described as the identification of regions of interest (i.e., domains) in protein sequences and the assignment of biological functions. Despite the existence of numerous tools, challenges remain in terms of speed, flexibility, and reproducibility. In the big data era, it is also increasingly important to cease limiting our findings to a single reference, coalescing knowledge from different data sources, and thus overcoming some limitations in overly relying on computationally generated data from single sources. Results: We implemented a protein annotation tool, Mantis, which uses database identifiers intersection and text mining to integrate knowledge from multiple reference data sources into a single consensus-driven output. Mantis is flexible, allowing for the customization of reference data and execution parameters, and is reproducible across different research goals and user environments. We implemented a depth-first search algorithm for domain-specific annotation, which significantly improved annotation performance compared to sequence-wide annotation. The parallelized implementation of Mantis results in short runtimes while also outputting high coverage and high-quality protein function annotations. Conclusions: Mantis is a protein function annotation tool that produces high-quality consensus-driven protein annotations.

Pairing with the impetus offered by high-throughput methods to key areas such as non-model organism studies, their operation continuously evolves to meet the corresponding computational challenges. Here, we present a Tier 2 (regional) HPC facility, operating for over a decade at the Institute of Marine Biology, Biotechnology, and Aquaculture of the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research in Greece. Strategic choices made in design and upgrades aimed to strike a balance between depth (the need for a few high-memory nodes) and breadth (a number of slimmer nodes), as dictated by the idiosyncrasy of the supported research. Qualitative computational requirement analysis of the latter revealed the diversity of marine fields, methods, and approaches adopted to translate data into knowledge. In addition, hardware and software architectures, usage statistics, policy, and user management aspects of the facility are presented. Drawing upon the last decade's experience from the different levels of operation of the Institute of Marine Biology, Biotechnology, and Aquaculture HPC facility, a number of lessons are presented; these have contributed to the facility's future directions in light of emerging distribution technologies (e.g., containers) and Research Infrastructure evolution. In combination with detailed knowledge of the facility usage and its upcoming upgrade, future collaborations in marine research and beyond are envisioned. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

However, high-density haplotype reference panels are unavailable in most agricultural species, limiting accurate genotype imputation in large populations. Moreover, the infinitesimal model of quantitative traits implies that weak association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome, further complicating the genetic analysis. Hence, there is a need to develop new methods for sequencing large cohorts without large reference panels. Results: We describe a Tn5-based highly accurate, cost- A nd time-efficient, low-coverage sequencing method to obtain 11.3 million whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 2,869 Duroc boars at a mean depth of 0.73×. On the basis of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms, a genome-wide association study was performed, resulting in 14 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 7 of 21 important agricultural traits in pigs. These QTLs harbour genes, such as ABCD4 for total teat number and HMGA1 for back fat thickness, and provided a starting point for further investigation. The inheritance models of the different traits varied greatly. Most follow the minor-polygene model, but this can be attributed to different reasons, such as the shaping of genetic architecture by artificial selection for this population and sufficiently interconnected minor gene regulatory networks. Conclusions: Genome-wide association study results for 21 important agricultural traits identified 14 QTLs/genes and showed their genetic architectures, providing guidance for genetic improvement harnessing genomic features. The Tn5-based low-coverage sequencing method can be applied to large-scale genome studies for any species without a good reference panel and can be used for agricultural breeding.  © 2021 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press GigaScience.","Animals; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Male; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Swine; Whole Genome Sequencing; animal experiment; article; artificial selection; breeding; controlled study; gene regulatory network; genetic improvement; genome-wide association study; genotype; inheritance; nonhuman; pig; quantitative trait locus; single nucleotide polymorphism; thickness; whole genome sequencing; animal; genetics; genotype; male; phenotype; pig; quantitative trait locus; whole genome sequencing","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111855406"

Several long-read sequencing technologies are available, and a growing number of algorithms have been developed to assemble the reads generated by those technologies. When starting a new genome project, it is therefore challenging to select the most cost-effective sequencing technology, as well as the most appropriate software for assembly and polishing. It is thus important to benchmark different approaches applied to the same sample. Results: Here, we report a comparison of 3 long-read sequencing technologies applied to the de novo assembly of a plant genome, Macadamia jansenii. We have generated sequencing data using Pacific Biosciences (Sequel I), Oxford Nanopore Technologies (PromethION), and BGI (single-tube Long Fragment Read) technologies for the same sample. Several assemblers were benchmarked in the assembly of Pacific Biosciences and Nanopore reads. Results obtained from combining long-read technologies or short-read and long-read technologies are also presented. The assemblies were compared for contiguity, base accuracy, and completeness, as well as sequencing costs and DNA material requirements. Conclusions: The 3 long-read technologies produced highly contiguous and complete genome assemblies of M. jansenii. At the time of sequencing, the cost associated with each method was significantly different, but continuous improvements in technologies have resulted in greater accuracy, increased throughput, and reduced costs. We propose updating this comparison regularly with reports on significant iterations of the sequencing technologies.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Genome, Bacterial; Genome, Plant; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software; DNA; DNA fragment; genomic DNA; accuracy; Article; comparative study; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; DNA extraction; DNA library; DNA sequence; gene sequence; genetic algorithm; haplotype; high throughput sequencing; Macadamia; Macadamia jansenii; nonhuman; plant genetics; plant genome; plant leaf; priority journal; bacterial genome; high throughput sequencing; plant genome; software","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098927136"

Features derived from structural and functional MRI data are sensitive to the algorithmic or parametric differences of preprocessing tasks, such as image normalization, registration, and segmentation to name a few. Therefore it is critical to understand and potentially mitigate the cumulative biases of pipelines in order to distinguish biological effects from methodological variance. Methods: Here we use an open structural MRI dataset (ABIDE), supplemented with the Human Connectome Project, to highlight the impact of pipeline selection on cortical thickness measures. Specifically, we investigate the effect of (i) software tool (e.g., ANTS, CIVET, FreeSurfer), (ii) cortical parcellation (Desikan-Killiany-Tourville, Destrieux, Glasser), and (iii) quality control procedure (manual, automatic). We divide our statistical analyses by (i) method type, i.e., task-free (unsupervised) versus task-driven (supervised); and (ii) inference objective, i.e., neurobiological group differences versus individual prediction. Results: Results show that software, parcellation, and quality control significantly affect task-driven neurobiological inference. Additionally, software selection strongly affects neurobiological (i.e. group) and individual task-free analyses, and quality control alters the performance for the individual-centric prediction tasks. Conclusions: This comparative performance evaluation partially explains the source of inconsistencies in neuroimaging findings. Furthermore, it underscores the need for more rigorous scientific workflows and accessible informatics resources to replicate and compare preprocessing pipelines to address the compounding problem of reproducibility in the age of large-scale, data-driven computational neuroscience. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Therefore, there is a need for more scalable and higher performance workflows of these deep learning methods. Almost all existing cluster-scaled variant-calling workflows that use Apache Spark/Hadoop as big data frameworks loosely integrate existing single-node pre-processing and variant-calling applications. Using Apache Spark just for distributing/scheduling data among loosely coupled applications or using I/O-based storage for storing the output of intermediate applications does not exploit the full benefit of Apache Spark in-memory processing. To achieve this, we propose a native Spark-based workflow that uses Python and Apache Arrow to enable efficient transfer of data between different workflow stages. This benefits from the ease of programmability of Python and the high efficiency of Arrow's columnar in-memory data transformations. Results: Here we present a scalable, parallel, and efficient implementation of next-generation sequencing data pre-processing and variant-calling workflows. Our design tightly integrates most pre-processing workflow stages, using Spark built-in functions to sort reads by coordinates and mark duplicates efficiently. Our approach outperforms state-of-The-Art implementations by >2 times for the pre-processing stages, creating a scalable and high-performance solution for DeepVariant for both CPU-only and CPU + GPU clusters. Conclusions: We show the feasibility and easy scalability of our approach to achieve high performance and efficient resource utilization for variant-calling analysis on high-performance computing clusters using the standardized Apache Arrow data representations.

Its success is hindered, however, by a low degree of plant breeding and improvement. Findings: We sequenced the fonio genome with long-read SMRT-cell technology, yielding a ∼761 Mb assembly in 3,329 contigs (N50, 1.73 Mb; L50, 126). The assembly approaches a high level of completion, with a BUSCO score of >99%. The fonio genome was found to be a tetraploid, with most of the genome retained as homoeologous duplications that differ overall by ∼4.3%, neglecting indels. The 2 genomes within fonio were found to have begun their independent divergence ∼3.1 million years ago. The repeat content (>49%) is fairly standard for a grass genome of this size, but the ratio of Gypsy to Copia long terminal repeat retrotransposons (∼6.7) was found to be exceptionally high. Several genes related to future improvement of the crop were identified including shattering, plant height, and grain size. Analysis of fonio population genetics, primarily in Mali, indicated that the crop has extensive genetic diversity that is largely partitioned across a north-south gradient coinciding with the Sahel and Sudan grassland domains.

Advances in genomics sequencing, image processing, and medical data management have supported data collection and management within medical institutions. These efforts have produced large-scale datasets and have enabled integrative analyses that provide a more thorough look of the impact of a disease on the underlying system. The integration of large-scale biomedical data commonly involves several complex data transformation steps, such as combining datasets to build feature vectors for learning analysis. Thus, scalable data integration solutions play a key role in the future of targeted medicine. Though large-scale data processing frameworks have shown promising performance for many domains, they fail to support scalable processing of complex datatypes. Solution: To address these issues and achieve scalable processing of multi-modal biomedical data, we present TraNCE, a framework that automates the difficulties of designing distributed analyses with complex biomedical data types. Performance: We outline research and clinical applications for the platform, including data integration support for building feature sets for classification. We show that the system is capable of outperforming the common alternative, based on ""flattening""complex data structures, and runs efficiently when alternative approaches are unable to perform at all. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses across ant species and castes have revealed important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ant caste differentiation. However, most current ant genomes and transcriptomes are highly fragmented and incomplete, which hinders our understanding of the molecular basis for complex ant societies. Findings: By hybridizing Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, and Hi-C sequencing technologies, we de novo assembled a chromosome-level genome for Monomorium pharaonis, with a scaffold N50 of 27.2 Mb. Our new assembly provides better resolution for the discovery of genome rearrangement events at the chromosome level. Analysis of full-length isoform sequencing (ISO-seq) suggested that ∼15 Gb of ISO-seq data were sufficient to cover most expressed genes, but the number of transcript isoforms steadily increased with sequencing data coverage. Our high-depth ISO-seq data greatly improved the quality of gene annotation and enabled the accurate detection of alternative splicing isoforms in different castes of M. pharaonis. Comparative transcriptome analysis across castes based on the ISO-seq data revealed an unprecedented number of transcript isoforms, including many caste-specific isoforms. We also identified a number of conserved long non-coding RNAs that evolved specifically in ant lineages and several that were conserved across insect lineages. Conclusions: We produced a high-quality chromosome-level genome for M. pharaonis, which significantly improved previous short-read assemblies. Together with full-length transcriptomes for all castes, we generated a highly accurate annotation for this ant species. These long-read sequencing results provide a useful resource for future functional studies on the genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of social behaviors and organization in ants.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Animals; Ants; Chromosomes; Gene Expression Profiling; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Transcriptome; long untranslated RNA; RNA; transcriptome; transcriptome; alternative RNA splicing; Article; chromosome analysis; comparative study; female; gene expression; gene rearrangement; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic code; genetic transcription; insect caste; male; molecular evolution; Monomorium pharaonis; nonhuman; priority journal; sequence analysis; animal; ant; chromosome; gene expression profiling; genetics; molecular genetics","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098475946"

Distinguishing virulent and temperate phage-derived sequences in metavirome data is important for elucidating their different roles in interactions with bacterial hosts and regulation of microbial communities. However, there is no experimental or computational approach to effectively classify their sequences in culture-independent metavirome. We present a new computational method, DeePhage, which can directly and rapidly judge each read or contig as a virulent or temperate phage-derived fragment. Findings: DeePhage uses a ""one-hot""encoding form to represent DNA sequences in detail. Sequence signatures are detected via a convolutional neural network to obtain valuable local features. The accuracy of DeePhage on 5-fold cross-validation reaches as high as 89%, nearly 10% and 30% higher than that of 2 similar tools, PhagePred and PHACTS. On real metavirome, DeePhage correctly predicts the highest proportion of contigs when using BLAST as annotation, without apparent preferences. Besides, DeePhage reduces running time vs PhagePred and PHACTS by 245 and 810 times, respectively, under the same computational configuration. By direct detection of the temperate viral fragments from metagenome and metavirome, we furthermore propose a new strategy to explore phage transformations in the microbial community. The ability to detect such transformations provides us a new insight into the potential treatment for human disease. Conclusions: DeePhage is a novel tool developed to rapidly and efficiently identify 2 kinds of phage fragments especially for metagenomics analysis.

The relationship between them is close enough that they can mate; however, their temperature adaptability is quite different. Results: In this study, we sequenced and assembled the whole genomes of C. argus and C. maculata and obtained chromosome-level genome assemblies of 630.39 and 618.82 Mb, respectively. Contig N50 was 13.20 and 21.73 Mb, and scaffold N50 was 27.66 and 28.37 Mb, with 28,054 and 24,115 coding genes annotated for C. argus and C. maculata, respectively. Our analyses showed that C. argus and C. maculata have 24 and 21 chromosomes, respectively. Three pairs of chromosomes in C. argus correspond to 3 chromosomes in C. maculata, suggesting that 3 chromosomal fusion events occurred in C. maculata. Comparative analysis of their gene families showed that some immune-related genes were unique or expandable to C. maculata, such as genes related to herpes simplex infection. Analysis of the transcriptome differences related to temperature adaptation revealed that the brain and liver of C. argus rapidly produced more differentially expressed genes than C. maculata. Genes in the FoxO signalling pathway were significantly enriched in C. argus during the cooling process (P < 0.05), and the expression of 3 transcription factor genes in this pathway was significantly different between C. argus and C. maculata (P < 0.01). Conclusions: C. maculata may have higher resistance to certain diseases, whereas C. argus has a faster and stronger response to lowerature stress and thus has better adaptability to a lowerature environment. This study provides a high-quality genome research platform for follow-up studies of Channidae and provides important clues regarding differences in the lowerature adaptations of fish.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

This article presents a vulnerability analysis of container images for scientific data analysis. We compare results obtained with 4 vulnerability scanners, focusing on the use case of neuroscience data analysis, and quantifying the effect of image update and minification on the number of vulnerabilities.

Findings: High-coverage long- and short-read sequence data generated on Pacific Biosciences and Illumina platforms were used to generate an initial assembly, which was then scaffolded into 10 pseudo-chromosomes using both Hi-C sequencing and a high-density linkage map. The assembly has a scaffold N50 of 58.4 Mb and a contig N50 of 1.8 Mb, representing a step advance on the previously published C. gigas assembly. Annotation based on Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq and Illumina RNA-Seq resulted in identification of ∼30,000 putative protein-coding genes. Annotation of putative repeat elements highlighted an enrichment of Helitron rolling-circle transposable elements, suggesting their potential role in shaping the evolution of the C. gigas genome. Conclusions: This new chromosome-level assembly will be an enabling resource for genetics and genomics studies to support fundamental insight into bivalve biology, as well as for selective breeding of C. gigas in aquaculture.  © 2021 The Author(s).","Animals; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes; Crassostrea; Ecosystem; Genome; animal tissue; aquaculture; Article; breeding; chromosome analysis; contig mapping; Crassostrea gigas; female; gene mapping; genetic analysis; genetic code; genetic linkage; genetic transcription; molecular genetics; nonhuman; sequence analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; whole genome sequencing; animal; chromosomal mapping; chromosome; Crassostrea; ecosystem; genetics; genome","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103480555"

Missing annotations makes it impossible for researchers to find datasets specific to their needs. Findings: Here, we investigate RNA-sequencing metadata prediction based on gene expression values. We present a deep-learning-based domain adaptation algorithm for the automatic annotation of RNA-sequencing metadata. We show, in multiple experiments, that our model is better at integrating heterogeneous training data compared with existing linear regression-based approaches, resulting in improved tissue type classification. By using a model architecture similar to Siamese networks, the algorithm can learn biases from datasets with few samples. Conclusion: Using our novel domain adaptation approach, we achieved metadata annotation accuracies up to 15.7% better than a previously published method. Using the best model, we provide a list of >10,000 novel tissue and sex label annotations for 8,495 unique SRA samples. Our approach has the potential to revive idle datasets by automated annotation making them more searchable.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Mouse embryos are a typical model for investigation of human developmental diseases. By obtaining 3D high-resolution scans of the mouse embryo heads, we gain valuable morphological information about the structures prominent in the development of future face, brain, and sensory organs. The development of facial skeleton tracked in these μCT data provides a valuable background for further studies of congenital craniofacial diseases and normal development. Findings: In this work, reusable tomographic data from 7 full 3D scans of mouse embryo heads are presented and made publicly available. The ages of these embryos range from E12.5 to E18.5. The samples were stained by phosphotungstic acid prior to scanning, which greatly enhanced the contrast of various tissues in the reconstructed images and enabled precise segmentation. The images were obtained on a laboratory-based μCT system. Furthermore, we provide manually segmented masks of mesenchymal condensations (for E12.5 and E13.5) and cartilage present in the nasal capsule of the scanned embryos. Conclusion: We present a comprehensive dataset of X-ray 3D computed tomography images of the developing mouse head with high-quality manual segmentation masks of cartilaginous nasal capsules. The provided μCT images can be used for studying any other major structure within the developing mouse heads. The high quality of the manually segmented models of nasal capsules may be instrumental to understanding the complex process of the development of the face in a mouse model. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

In contrast, individual differences in mental function are explained by psychological constructs, e.g., intelligence or neuroticism. These constructs are typically assessed by tailored neuropsychological tests that build on expert judgement and require careful interpretation. Could machine learning on large samples from the general population be used to build proxy measures of these constructs that do not require human intervention? Results: Here, we built proxy measures by applying machine learning on multimodal MR images and rich sociodemographic information from the largest biomedical cohort to date: the UK Biobank. Objective model comparisons revealed that all proxies captured the target constructs and were as useful, and sometimes more useful, than the original measures for characterizing real-world health behavior (sleep, exercise, tobacco, alcohol consumption). We observed this complementarity of proxy measures and original measures at capturing multiple health-related constructs when modeling from, both, brain signals and sociodemographic data. Conclusion: Population modeling with machine learning can derive measures of mental health from heterogeneous inputs including brain signals and questionnaire data. This may complement or even substitute for psychometric assessments in clinical populations.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

To facilitate this a library was produced out of the original SAMtools implementation, with a focus on performance and robustness. The file formats themselves have become international standards under the jurisdiction of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health. Findings: We present a software library for providing programmatic access to sequencing alignment and variant formats. It was born out of the widely used SAMtools and BCFtools applications. Considerable improvements have been made to the original code plus many new features including newer access protocols, the addition of the CRAM file format, better indexing and iterators, and better use of threading. Conclusion: Since the original Samtools release, performance has been considerably improved, with a BAM read-write loop running 5 times faster and BAM to SAM conversion 13 times faster (both using 16 threads, compared to Samtools 0.1.19).

Lizards in the genus Sceloporus have a long history as important ecological, evolutionary, and physiological models, making them a valuable target for the development of genomic resources. Findings: We present a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome assembly, SceUnd1.0 (using 10X Genomics Chromium, HiC, and Pacific Biosciences data), and tissue/developmental stage transcriptomes for the eastern fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus. We performed synteny analysis with other snake and lizard assemblies to identify broad patterns of chromosome evolution including the fusion of micro-and macrochromosomes. We also used this new assembly to provide improved reference-based genome assemblies for 34 additional Sceloporus species. Finally, we used RNAseq and whole-genome resequencing data to compare 3 assemblies, each representing an increased level of cost and effort: Supernova Assembly with data from 10X Genomics Chromium, HiRise Assembly that added data from HiC, and PBJelly Assembly that added data from Pacific Biosciences sequencing. We found that the Supernova Assembly contained the full genome and was a suitable reference for RNAseq and single-nucleotide polymorphism calling, but the chromosome-level scaffolds provided by the addition of HiC data allowed synteny and whole-genome association mapping analyses. The subsequent addition of PacBio data doubled the contig N50 but provided negligible gains in scaffold length.

Findings: In this study, we produced de novo chromosome-level genome assemblies for A. coluzzii and A. arabiensis using the long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology and the Hi-C scaffolding approach. We obtained 273.4 and 256.8 Mb of the total assemblies for A. coluzzii and A. arabiensis, respectively. Each assembly consists of 3 chromosome-scale scaffolds (X, 2, 3), complete mitochondrion, and unordered contigs identified as autosomal pericentromeric DNA, X pericentromeric DNA, and Y sequences. Comparison of these assemblies with the existing assemblies for these species demonstrated that we obtained improved reference-quality genomes.

Until now, only limited genomic information has been available for the genetic studies and breeding programs of plums. Prunus salicina, an important diploid plum species, plays a predominant role in modern commercial plum production. Here we selected P. salicina for whole-genome sequencing and present a chromosome-level genome assembly through the combination of Pacific Biosciences sequencing, Illumina sequencing, and Hi-C technology. Findings: The assembly had a total size of 284.2 Mb, with contig N50 of 1.78 Mb and scaffold N50 of 32.32 Mb. A total of 96.56% of the assembled sequences were anchored onto 8 pseudochromosomes, and 24,448 protein-coding genes were identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed that P. salicina had a close relationship with Prunus mume and Prunus armeniaca, with P. salicina diverging from their common ancestor ∼9.05 million years ago. During P. salicina evolution 146 gene families were expanded, and some cell wall-related GO terms were significantly enriched. It was noteworthy that members of the DUF579 family, a new class involved in xylan biosynthesis, were significantly expanded in P. salicina, which provided new insight into the xylan metabolism in plums. Conclusions: We constructed the first high-quality chromosome-level plum genome using Pacific Biosciences, Illumina, and Hi-C technologies.

Besides contributing to the build-up of antimicrobial resistance, antibiotics are known to modulate the gut microbial composition. As an alternative to antibiotic treatment, studies have previously investigated the potential of probiotics for the prevention of postweaning diarrhea. In order to describe the post-weaning gut microbiota, and to study the effects of two probiotics formulations and of intramuscular antibiotic treatment on the gut microbiota, we sampled and processed over 800 faecal time-series samples from 126 piglets and 42 sows. Results: Here we report on the largest shotgun metagenomic dataset of the pig gut lumen microbiome to date, consisting of >8 Tbp of shotgun metagenomic sequencing data. The animal trial, the workflow from sample collection to sample processing, and the preparation of libraries for sequencing, are described in detail. We provide a preliminary analysis of the dataset, centered on a taxonomic profiling of the samples, and a 16S-based beta diversity analysis of the mothers and the piglets in the first 5 weeks after weaning. Conclusions: This study was conducted to generate a publicly available databank of the faecal metagenome of weaner piglets aged between 3 and 9 weeks old, treated with different probiotic formulations and intramuscular antibiotic treatment. Besides investigating the effects of the probiotic and intramuscular antibiotic treatment, the dataset can be explored to assess a wide range of ecological questions with regards to antimicrobial resistance, host-associated microbial and phage communities, and their dynamics during the aging of the host. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

A number of human-subject studies have been conducted to examine the use of mobile sensing to uncover individual behavioral patterns and health outcomes, yet minimal attention has been placed on measuring living environments together with other human-centered sensing data. Moreover, the participant sample size in most existing studies falls well below a few hundred, leaving questions open about the reliability of findings on the relations between mobile sensing signals and human outcomes. Results: To address these limitations, we developed a home environment sensor kit for continuous indoor air quality tracking and deployed it in conjunction with smartphones, Fitbits, and ecological momentary assessments in a cohort study of up to 1,584 college student participants per data type for 3 weeks. We propose a conceptual framework that systematically organizes human-centric data modalities by their temporal coverage and spatial freedom. Then we report our study procedure, technologies and methods deployed, and descriptive statistics of the collected data that reflect the participants' mood, sleep, behavior, and living environment. Conclusions: We were able to collect from a large participant cohort satisfactorily complete multi-modal sensing and survey data in terms of both data continuity and participant adherence. Our novel data and conceptual development provide important guidance for data collection and hypothesis generation in future human-centered sensing studies.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Findings: The GenTree Platform contains phenotypic and environmental data from 4,959 trees from 12 ecologically and economically important European forest tree species: Abies alba Mill. (silver fir), Betula pendula Roth. (silver birch), Fagus sylvatica L. (European beech), Picea abies (L.) H. Karst (Norway spruce), Pinus cembra L. (Swiss stone pine), Pinus halepensis Mill. (Aleppo pine), Pinus nigra Arnold (European black pine), Pinus pinaster Aiton (maritime pine), Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine), Populus nigra L. (European black poplar), Taxus baccata L. (English yew), and Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. (sessile oak). Phenotypic (height, diameter at breast height, crown size, bark thickness, biomass, straightness, forking, branch angle, fructification), regeneration, environmental in situ measurements (soil depth, vegetation cover, competition indices), and environmental modeling data extracted by using bilinear interpolation accounting for surrounding conditions of each tree (precipitation, temperature, insolation, drought indices) were obtained from trees in 194 sites covering the species' geographic ranges and reflecting local environmental gradients. Conclusion: The GenTree Platform is a new resource for investigating ecological and evolutionary processes in forest trees. The coherent phenotyping and environmental characterization across 12 species in their European ranges allow for a wide range of analyses from forest ecologists, conservationists, and macro-ecologists. Also, the data here presented can be linked to the GenTree Dendroecological collection, the GenTree Leaf Trait collection, and the GenTree Genomic collection presented elsewhere, which together build the largest evolutionary forest ecology data collection available.  © 2021 The Author(s).

The rapid growth in software that addresses these challenges for different genomics applications is difficult to keep track of, which makes it hard for users to choose the most appropriate tool for their analysis goal and for developers to identify areas of need and existing solutions to benchmark against. Findings: We describe the implementation of long-read-Tools.org, an open-source database that organizes the rapidly expanding collection of long-read data analysis tools and allows its exploration through interactive browsing and filtering. The current database release contains 478 tools across 32 categories. Most tools are developed in Python, and the most frequent analysis tasks include base calling, de novo assembly, error correction, quality checking/filtering, and isoform detection, while long-read single-cell data analysis and transcriptomics are areas with the fewest tools available. Conclusion: Continued growth in the application of long-read sequencing in genomics research positions the long-read-Tools.org database as an essential resource that allows researchers to keep abreast of both established and emerging software to help guide the selection of the most relevant tool for their analysis needs. © 2021 The Author(s).

These cloud providers represent an alternative for the execution of large computational biology experiments like transcriptome annotation, which is a complex analytical process that requires the interrogation of multiple biological databases with several advanced computational tools. The core components of annotation pipelines published since 2012 are BLAST sequence alignments using annotated databases of both nucleotide or protein sequences almost exclusively with networked on-premises compute systems. Findings: We compare multiple BLAST sequence alignments using AWS and GCP. We prepared several Jupyter Notebooks with all the code required to submit computing jobs to the batch system on each cloud provider. We consider the consequence of the number of query transcripts in input files and the effect on cost and processing time. We tested compute instances with 16, 32, and 64 vCPUs on each cloud provider. Four classes of timing results were collected: the total run time, the time for transferring the BLAST databases to the instance local solid-state disk drive, the time to execute the CWL script, and the time for the creation, set-up, and release of an instance. This study aims to establish an estimate of the cost and compute time needed for the execution of multiple BLAST runs in a cloud environment. Conclusions: We demonstrate that public cloud providers are a practical alternative for the execution of advanced computational biology experiments at low cost. Using our cloud recipes, the BLAST alignments required to annotate a transcriptome with ∼500,000 transcripts can be processed in <2 hours with a compute cost of ∼$200-$250. In our opinion, for BLAST-based workflows, the choice of cloud platform is not dependent on the workflow but, rather, on the specific details and requirements of the cloud provider. These choices include the accessibility for institutional use, the technical knowledge required for effective use of the platform services, and the availability of open source frameworks such as APIs to deploy the workflow.  © 2021 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of GigaScience.","Cloud Computing; Computational Biology; Databases, Factual; Software; Transcriptome; Workflow; transcriptome; amazon web service; application service provider; Article; bioinformatics; cloud computing; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; data analysis; genetic database; Google cloud platform; molecular genetics; priority journal; RNA transcription; sequence alignment; workflow; biology; cloud computing; factual database; software","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100551767"

The final whole-genome assembly of the Oriental river prawn was ∼4.5 Gb in size, with predictions of 44,086 protein-coding genes. A total of 49 chromosomes were determined, with an anchor ratio of 94.7% and a scaffold N50 of 86.8 Mb. A whole-genome duplication event was deduced to have happened 109.8 million years ago. By integration of genome and transcriptome data, 21 genes were predicted as sex-related candidate genes. Conclusion: The first high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of the oriental river prawn was obtained. These genomic data, along with transcriptome sequences, are essential for understanding sex-differentiation and development mechanisms in the oriental river prawn, as well as providing genetic resources for in-depth studies on developmental and evolutionary biology in arthropods. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Following the miniaturization of integrated circuitry and other computer hardware over the past several decades, DNA sequencing is on a similar path. Leading this trend is the Oxford Nanopore sequencing platform, which currently offers the hand-held MinION instrument and even smaller instruments on the horizon. This technology has been used in several important applications, including the analysis of genomes of major pathogens in remote stations around the world. However, despite the simplicity of the sequencer, an equally simple and portable analysis platform is not yet available. Results. iGenomics is the first comprehensive mobile genome analysis application, with capabilities to align reads, call variants, and visualize the results entirely on an iOS device. Implemented in Objective-C using the FM-index, banded dynamic programming, and other high-performance bioinformatics techniques, iGenomics is optimized to run in a mobile environment. We benchmark iGenomics using a variety of real and simulated Nanopore sequencing datasets of viral and bacterial genomes and show that iGenomics has performance comparable to the popular BWA-MEM/SAMtools/IGV suite, without necessitating a laptop or server cluster.

Automating these processes requires highly efficient and scalable methods and software, but so far there is no workflow solution to easily process 1 million GWAS samples. Results: Here we present BIGwas, a portable, fully automated quality control and association testing pipeline for large-scale binary and quantitative trait GWAS data provided by biobank resources. By using Nextflow workflow and Singularity software container technology, BIGwas performs resource-efficient and reproducible analyses on a local computer or any high-performance compute (HPC) system with just 1 command, with no need to manually install a software execution environment or various software packages. For a single-command GWAS analysis with 974,818 individuals and 92 million genetic markers, BIGwas takes ∼16 days on a small HPC system with only 7 compute nodes to perform a complete GWAS QC and association analysis protocol. Our dynamic parallelization approach enables shorter runtimes for large HPCs. Conclusions: Researchers without extensive bioinformatics knowledge and with few computer resources can use BIGwas to perform multi-cohort GWAS with 1 million GWAS samples and, if desired, use it to build their own (genome-wide) PheWAS resource.

Thus, both human and mouse genetic material is sequenced. Several methods have been developed to remove mouse sequencing reads from RNA-seq or exome sequencing PDX data and improve the downstream signal. However, for more recent chromatin conformation capture technologies (Hi-C), the effect of mouse reads remains undefined. Results: We evaluated the effect of mouse read removal on the quality of Hi-C data using in silico created PDX Hi-C data with 10% and 30% mouse reads. Additionally, we generated 2 experimental PDX Hi-C datasets using different library preparation strategies. We evaluated 3 alignment strategies (Direct, Xenome, Combined) and 3 pipelines (Juicer, HiC-Pro, HiCExplorer) on Hi-C data quality. Conclusions: Removal of mouse reads had little-to-no effect on data quality as compared with the results obtained with the Direct alignment strategy. Juicer extracted more valid chromatin interactions for Hi-C matrices, regardless of the mouse read removal strategy. However, the pipeline effect was minimal, while the library preparation strategy had the largest effect on all quality metrics. Together, our study presents comprehensive guidelines on PDX Hi-C data processing. © The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of GigaScience.

Comprehensive quality assessment typically requires full genome alignment, which costs a substantial amount of computational resources and turnaround time. Existing tools are either computationally expensive owing to full alignment or lacking essential quality metrics by skipping read alignment. Findings: We developed a set of rapid and accurate methods to produce comprehensive quality metrics directly from a subset of raw sequence reads (from whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing) without full alignment. Our methods offer orders of magnitude faster turnaround time than existing full alignment-based methods while providing comprehensive and sophisticated quality metrics, including estimates of genetic ancestry and cross-sample contamination. Conclusions: By rapidly and comprehensively performing the quality assessment, our tool will help investigators detect potential issues in ultra-high-throughput sequence reads in real time within a low computational cost at the early stages of the analyses, ensuring high-quality downstream results and preventing unexpected loss in time, money, and invaluable specimens.  © 2021 The Author(s).

However, transforming the data in a way that preserves the privacy of subjects while maintaining a high degree of data quality is challenging and particularly difficult when processing complex datasets that contain a high number of attributes. In this article we present how we extended the open source software ARX to improve its support for high-dimensional, biomedical datasets. Findings: For improving ARX's capability to find optimal transformations when processing high-dimensional data, we implement 2 novel search algorithms. The first is a greedy top-down approach and is oriented on a formally implemented bottom-up search. The second is based on a genetic algorithm. We evaluated the algorithms with different datasets, transformation methods, and privacy models. The novel algorithms mostly outperformed the previously implemented bottom-up search. In addition, we extended the GUI to provide a high degree of usability and performance when working with high-dimensional datasets. Conclusion: With our additions we have significantly enhanced ARX's ability to handle high-dimensional data in terms of processing performance as well as usability and thus can further facilitate data sharing.  © 2021 The Author(s).

By connecting publications with NSD records, NSD geographical provenance information, and author geographical information, it becomes possible to assess the contribution of NSD to infer trends in scientific knowledge gain at the global level. Findings: We extracted and linked records from the European Nucleotide Archive to citations in open-access publications aggregated at Europe PubMed Central. A total of 8,464,292 ENA accessions with geographical provenance information were associated with publications. We conducted a data quality review to uncover potential issues in publication citation information extraction and author affiliation tagging and developed and implemented best-practice recommendations for citation extraction. We constructed flat data tables and a data warehouse with an interactive web application to enable ad hoc exploration of NSD use and summary statistics. Conclusions: The extraction and linking of NSD with associated publication citations enables transparency. The quality review contributes to enhanced text mining methods for identifier extraction and use. Furthermore, the global provision and use of NSD enable scientists worldwide to join literature and sequence databases in a multidimensional fashion.

Analyzing the transcriptomes between different projects is highly desirable because this would allow for better assessment of which biological effects are consistent across independent studies. However it is difficult to compare and contrast data across different projects because there are substantial batch effects from computational processing, single-cell technology utilized, and the natural biological variation. While many single-cell transcriptome-specific batch correction methods purport to remove the technical noise, it is difficult to ascertain which method functions best. Results: We developed a lightweight R package (scPOP, single-cell Pick Optimal Parameters) that brings in batch integration methods and uses a simple heuristic to balance batch merging and cell type/cluster purity. We use this package along with a Snakefile-based workflow system to demonstrate how to optimally merge 766,615 cells from 33 retina datsets and 3 species to create a massive ocular single-cell transcriptome meta-atlas.

In point cloud studies, the point cloud segmentation of individual plants to organs directly determines the accuracy of organ-level phenotype estimation and the reliability of the 3D plant reconstruction. However, highly accurate, automatic, and robust point cloud segmentation approaches for plants are unavailable. Thus, the high-throughput segmentation of many shoots is challenging. Although deep learning can feasibly solve this issue, software tools for 3D point cloud annotation to construct the training dataset are lacking. Results: We propose a top-to-down point cloud segmentation algorithm using optimal transportation distance for maize shoots. We apply our point cloud annotation toolkit for maize shoots, Label3DMaize, to achieve semi-automatic point cloud segmentation and annotation of maize shoots at different growth stages, through a series of operations, including stem segmentation, coarse segmentation, fine segmentation, and sample-based segmentation. The toolkit takes ∼4-10 minutes to segment a maize shoot and consumes 10-20% of the total time if only coarse segmentation is required. Fine segmentation is more detailed than coarse segmentation, especially at the organ connection regions. The accuracy of coarse segmentation can reach 97.2% that of fine segmentation.

However, it has not been objectively and systematically compared against Illumina short-read sequencers. Findings: By using the same KOREF sample, the Korean Reference Genome, we have compared 7 sequencing platforms including BGISEQ-500, DNBSEQ-T7, HiSeq2000, HiSeq2500, HiSeq4000, HiSeqX10, and NovaSeq6000. We measured sequencing quality by comparing sequencing statistics (base quality, duplication rate, and random error rate), mapping statistics (mapping rate, depth distribution, and percent GC coverage), and variant statistics (transition/transversion ratio, dbSNP annotation rate, and concordance rate with single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] genotyping chip) across the 7 sequencing platforms. We found that MGI platforms showed a higher concordance rate for SNP genotyping than HiSeq2000 and HiSeq4000. The similarity matrix of variant calls confirmed that the 2 MGI platforms have the most similar characteristics to the HiSeq2500 platform. Conclusions: Overall, MGI and Illumina sequencing platforms showed comparable levels of sequencing quality, uniformity of coverage, percent GC coverage, and variant accuracy; thus we conclude that the MGI platforms can be used for a wide range of genomics research fields at a lower cost than the Illumina platforms.  © 2021 The Author(s).","Benchmarking; Genome, Human; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Republic of Korea; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Whole Genome Sequencing; Article; comparative study; controlled study; gene sequence; genotype; human; human genome; illumina sequencing; male; single nucleotide polymorphism; South Korea; South Korean; whole genome sequencing; benchmarking; DNA sequence; high throughput sequencing","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102963897"

For specific cancers, proteins encoded by fusion transcripts have been identified as innovative therapeutic targets (e.g., EML4-ALK). Even though RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technologies combined with existing bioinformatics approaches have enabled researchers to systematically identify fusion transcripts, specifically detecting f-circRNAs in cells remains challenging owing to their general sparsity and low abundance in cancer cells but also owing to imperfect computational methods. Results: We developed the Python-based workflow ""Fcirc""to identify fusion linear and f-circRNAs from RNA-Seq data with high specificity. We applied Fcirc to 3 different types of RNA-Seq data scenarios: (i) actual synthetic spike-in RNA-Seq data, (ii) simulated RNA-Seq data, and (iii) actual cancer cell-derived RNA-Seq data. Fcirc showed significant advantages over existing methods regarding both detection accuracy (i.e., precision, recall, F-measure) and computing performance (i.e., lower runtimes). Conclusion: Fcirc is a powerful and comprehensive Python-based pipeline to identify linear and circular RNA transcripts from known fusion events in RNA-Seq datasets with higher accuracy and shorter computing times compared with previously published algorithms.

The management and exploration of these large-scale genomic variation data require programming skills. The public genotype querying databases of many species are usually centralized and implemented independently, making them difficult to update with new data over time. Currently, there is a lack of a widely used framework for setting up user-friendly web servers to explore new genomic variation data in diverse species. Results: Here, we present SnpHub, a Shiny/R-based server framework for retrieving, analysing, and visualizing large-scale genomic variation data that can be easily set up on any Linux server. After a pre-building process based on the provided VCF files and genome annotation files, the local server allows users to interactively access single-nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions/deletions with annotation information by locus or gene and to define sample sets through a web page. Users can freely analyse and visualize genomic variations in heatmaps, phylogenetic trees, haplotype networks, or geographical maps. Sample-specific sequences can be accessed as replaced by detected sequence variations. Conclusions: SnpHub can be applied to any species, and we build up a SnpHub portal website for wheat and its progenitors based on published data in recent studies.

Among these is the investigation of the viral communities residing in the human body and their impact on health and disease. To this end, the study of samples from multiple tissues is critical, yet, the complexity of such analysis calls for a dedicated pipeline. We provide an automatic and efficient pipeline for identification, assembly, and analysis of viral genomes that combines the DNA sequence data from multiple organs. TRACESPipe relies on cooperation among 3 modalities: Compression-based prediction, sequence alignment, and de novo assembly. The pipeline is ultra-fast and provides, additionally, secure transmission and storage of sensitive data. Findings: TRACESPipe performed outstandingly when tested on synthetic and ex vivo datasets, identifying and reconstructing all the viral genomes, including those with high levels of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. It also detected minimal levels of genomic variation between different organs. Conclusions: TRACESPipe's unique ability to simultaneously process and analyze samples from different sources enables the evaluation of within-host variability. This opens up the possibility to investigate viral tissue tropism, evolution, fitness, and disease associations. Moreover, additional features such as DNA damage estimation and mitochondrial DNA reconstruction and analysis, as well as exogenous-source controls, expand the utility of this pipeline to other fields such as forensics and ancient DNA studies.

The >200,000 microbial genomes now publicly available hold information on abundant novel chemistry. One way to navigate this vast genomic diversity is through comparative analysis of homologous BGCs, which allows identification of cross-species patterns that can be matched to the presence of metabolites or biological activities. However, current tools are hindered by a bottleneck caused by the expensive network-based approach used to group these BGCs into gene cluster families (GCFs). Results: Here, we introduce BiG-SLiCE, a tool designed to cluster massive numbers of BGCs. By representing them in Euclidean space, BiG-SLiCE can group BGCs into GCFs in a non-pairwise, near-linear fashion. We used BiG-SLiCE to analyze 1,225,071 BGCs collected from 209,206 publicly available microbial genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes within 10 days on a typical 36-core CPU server. We demonstrate the utility of such analyses by reconstructing a global map of secondary metabolic diversity across taxonomy to identify uncharted biosynthetic potential. BiG-SLiCE also provides a ""query mode""that can efficiently place newly sequenced BGCs into previously computed GCFs, plus a powerful output visualization engine that facilitates user-friendly data exploration. Conclusions: BiG-SLiCE opens up new possibilities to accelerate natural product discovery and offers a first step towards constructing a global and searchable interconnected network of BGCs. As more genomes are sequenced from understudied taxa, more information can be mined to highlight their potentially novel chemistry.

Results: Here, we introduce refgenie, a reference genome assembly asset manager. Refgenie makes it easier to organize, retrieve, and share genome analysis resources. In addition to genome indexes, refgenie can manage any files related to reference genomes, including sequences and annotation files. Refgenie includes a command line interface and a server application that provides a RESTful API, so it is useful for both tool development and analysis.

However, the genomic signatures associated with their distinct diets are unknown. Results: We conducted a genomic comparative analysis to study the evolutionary dynamics related to dietary diversification and specialization. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the genomes of five Phyllostomid species: one insect feeder (Macrotus waterhousii), one fruit feeder (Artibeus jamaicensis), and three nectar feeders from the Glossophaginae subfamily (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae, Leptonycteris nivalis, and Musonycteris harrisoni), also including the previously sequenced vampire Desmodus rotundus. Our phylogenomic analysis based on 22,388 gene families displayed differences in expansion and contraction events across the Phyllostomid lineages. Independently of diet, genes relevant for feeding strategies and food intake experienced multiple expansions and signatures of positive selection. We also found adaptation signatures associated with specialized diets: the vampire exhibited traits associated with a blood diet (i.e., coagulation mechanisms), whereas the nectarivore clade shares a group of positively selected genes involved in sugar, lipid, and iron metabolism. Interestingly, in fruit-nectar-feeding Phyllostomid and Pteropodids bats, we detected positive selection in two genes: AACS and ALKBH7, which are crucial in sugar and fat metabolism. Moreover, in these two proteins we found parallel amino acid substitutions in conserved positions exclusive to the tribe Glossophagini and to Pteropodids. Conclusions: Our findings illuminate the genomic and molecular shifts associated with the evolution of nectarivory and shed light on how nectar-feeding bats can avoid the adverse effects of diets with high glucose content. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

To systematically profile proteome dynamics during human embryonic stem cell differentiation into oligodendrocytes, we applied in-depth quantitative proteomics at different developmental stages and monitored changes in protein abundance using a multiplexed tandem mass tag-based proteomics approach. Findings: Our proteome data provided a comprehensive protein expression profile that highlighted specific expression clusters based on the protein abundances over the course of human oligodendrocyte lineage differentiation. We identified the eminence of the planar cell polarity signalling and autophagy (particularly macroautophagy) in the progression of oligodendrocyte lineage differentiation—the cooperation of which is assisted by 106 and 77 proteins, respectively, that showed significant expression changes in this differentiation process. Furthermore, differentially expressed protein analysis of the proteome profile of oligodendrocyte lineage cells revealed 378 proteins that were specifically upregulated only in 1 differentiation stage. In addition, comparative pairwise analysis of differentiation stages demonstrated that abundances of 352 proteins differentially changed between consecutive differentiation time points. Conclusions: Our study provides a comprehensive systematic proteomics profile of oligodendrocyte lineage cells that can serve as a resource for identifying novel biomarkers from these cells and for indicating numerous proteins that may contribute to regulating the development of myelinating oligodendrocytes and other cells of oligodendrocyte lineage. We showed the importance of planar cell polarity signalling in oligodendrocyte lineage differentiation and revealed the autophagy-related proteins that participate in oligodendrocyte lineage differentiation. © The Author(s) 2020.

While especially popular in the field of genomic analysis, Circos enables interactive graphing of any analytical data, including alternative scientific domain data and non-scientific data. This high degree of flexibility also comes with a high degree of complexity, which may present an obstacle for researchers not trained in programming or the UNIX command line. The Galaxy platform provides a user-friendly browser-based graphical interface incorporating a broad range of ""wrapped"" command line tools to facilitate accessibility. Findings: We have developed a Galaxy wrapper for Circos, thus combining the power of Circos with the accessibility and ease of use of the Galaxy platform. The combination substantially simplifies the specification and configuration of Circos plots for end users while retaining the power to produce publication-quality visualizations of complex multidimensional datasets. Conclusions: Galactic Circos enables the creation of publication-ready Circos plots using only a web browser, via the Galaxy platform. Users may download the full set of Circos configuration files of their plots for further manual customization.

This includes more than 30 million different radiological examinations from a population of 5.4 million and >2 PB of data collected since 2010. Methods: Scotland has a central archive of radiological data used to directly provide clinical care to patients. We have developed an architecture and platform to securely extract a copy of those data, link it to other clinical or social datasets, remove personal data to protect privacy, and make the resulting data available to researchers in a controlled Safe Haven environment. Results: An extensive software platform has been developed to host, extract, and link data from cohorts to answer research questions. The platform has been tested on 5 different test cases and is currently being further enhanced to support 3 exemplar research projects. Conclusions: The data available are from a range of radiological modalities and scanner types and were collected under different environmental conditions. These real-world, heterogenous data are valuable for training algorithms to support clinical decision making, especially for deep learning where large data volumes are required.

Lamiaceae (mints) are known for their chemodiversity and have been cultivated for use as culinary herbs, as well as sources of insect repellents, health-promoting compounds, and fragrance. Findings: We report the chromosome-scale genome assembly of Callicarpa americana L. (American beautyberry), a species within the early-diverging Callicarpoideae clade of Lamiaceae, known for its metallic purple fruits and use as an insect repellent due to its production of terpenoids. Using long-read sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding, we generated a 506.1-Mb assembly spanning 17 pseudomolecules with N50 contig and N50 scaffold sizes of 7.5 and 29.0 Mb, respectively. In all, 32,164 genes were annotated, including 53 candidate terpene synthases and 47 putative clusters of specialized metabolite biosynthetic pathways. Our analyses revealed 3 putative whole-genome duplication events, which, together with local tandem duplications, contributed to gene family expansion of terpene synthases. Kolavenyl diphosphate is a gateway to many of the bioactive terpenoids in C. americana; experimental validation confirmed that CamTPS2 encodes kolavenyl diphosphate synthase. Syntenic analyses with Tectona grandis L. f. (teak), a member of the Tectonoideae clade of Lamiaceae known for exceptionally strong wood resistant to insects, revealed 963 collinear blocks and 21,297 C. americana syntelogs. Conclusions: Access to the C. americana genome provides a road map for rapid discovery of genes encoding plant-derived agrichemicals and a key resource for understanding the evolution of chemical diversity in Lamiaceae.  © The Author(s) 2020.","Callicarpa; Chromosomes; Insect Repellents; Lamiaceae; Terpenes; contig; terpenoid; insect repellent; terpene; Article; biodiversity; biosynthesis; Callicarpa; Callicarpa americana; chromosome analysis; cladistics; comparative genomics; flow cytometry; gene duplication; gene expression; gene locus; gene structure; genetic analysis; genetic code; molecular evolution; nonhuman; plant tissue; priority journal; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; Tectona grandis; chromosome; genetics; Lamiaceae","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090376019"

To elucidate the evolution of chromosome architectures between ducks and chickens, and between birds and mammals, we produced a nearly complete chromosomal assembly of a female Pekin duck by combining long-read sequencing and multiplatform scaffolding techniques. Results: A major improvement of genome assembly and annotation quality resulted from the successful resolution of lineage-specific propagated repeats that fragmented the previous Illumina-based assembly. We found that the duck topologically associated domains (TAD) are demarcated by putative binding sites of the insulator protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, or transitions of active/inactive chromatin compartments, indicating conserved mechanisms of spatial chromosome folding with mammals. There are extensive overlaps of TAD boundaries between duck and chicken, and also between the TAD boundaries and chromosome inversion breakpoints. This suggests strong natural selection pressure on maintaining regulatory domain integrity, or vulnerability of TAD boundaries to DNA double-strand breaks. The duck W chromosome retains 2.5-fold more genes relative to chicken. Similar to the independently evolved human Y chromosome, the duck W evolved massive dispersed palindromic structures, and a pattern of sequence divergence with the Z chromosome that reflects stepwise suppression of homologous recombination. Conclusions: Our results provide novel insights into the conserved and convergently evolved chromosome features of birds and mammals, and also importantly add to the genomic resources for poultry studies. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Various DNA extraction methods have been compared to find protocols that robustly and most accurately reflect the original microbial community structures. However, these recommendations can be further refined by considering the time and cost demands in dealing with samples from very large human cohorts. Additionally, fungal DNA extraction performance has so far been little investigated. Results: We compared 6 DNA extraction protocols, MagPure Fast Stool DNA KF Kit B, Macherey NagelTM NucleoSpinTM ®Soil kit, Zymo Research Quick-DNATM Fecal/Soil Microbe kit, MOBIO DNeasy PowerSoil kit, the manual non-commercial protocol MetaHIT, and the recently published protocol Q using 1 microbial mock community (MMC) (containing 8 bacterial and 2 fungal strains) and fecal samples. All samples were manually extracted and subjected to shotgun metagenomics sequencing. Extracting DNA revealed high reproducibility within all 6 protocols, but microbial extraction efficiencies varied. The MMC results demonstrated that bead size was a determining factor for fungal and bacterial DNA yields. In human fecal samples, the MagPure bacterial extraction performed as well as the standardized protocol Q but was faster and more cost-effective. Extraction using the PowerSoil protocol resulted in a significantly higher ratio of gram-negative to gram-positive bacteria than other protocols, which might contribute to reported gut microbial differences between healthy adults. Conclusions: We emphasize the importance of bead size selection for bacterial and fungal DNA extraction. More importantly, the performance of the novel protocol MP matched that of the recommended standardized protocol Q but consumed less time, was more cost-effective, and is recommended for further large-scale human gut metagenomic studies. © The Author(s) 2020.

While the treatment of wastewater can remove most bacterial cells, some will inevitably survive treatment to be released into natural environments. Previous studies have investigated antibiotic resistance within wastewater treatment plants, but few studies have explored how a river's complete set of antibiotic resistance genes (the ""resistome"") is affected by the release of treated effluent into surface waters. Results: Here we used high-throughput, deep metagenomic sequencing to investigate the effect of treated wastewater effluent on the resistome of an urban river and the downstream distribution of effluent-associated antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements. Treated effluent release was found to be associated with increased abundance and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements. The impact of wastewater discharge on the river's resistome diminished with increasing distance from effluent discharge points. The resistome at river locations that were not immediately downstream from any wastewater discharge points was dominated by a single integron carrying genes associated with resistance to sulfonamides and quaternary ammonium compounds. Conclusions: Our study documents variations in the resistome of an urban watershed from headwaters to a major confluence in an urban center. Greater abundances and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes are associated with human fecal contamination in river surface water, but the fecal contamination effect seems to be localized, with little measurable effect in downstream waters. The diverse composition of antibiotic resistance genes throughout the watershed suggests the influence of multiple environmental and biological factors.  © 2020 The Author(s).

Chinese indigenous pigs have been historically introduced to improve Europe local pigs. However, the geographic origin and biological functions of introgressed Chinese genes in modern European pig breeds remain largely unknown. Results: Here we explored whole-genome sequencing data from 266 Eurasian wild boars and domestic pigs to produce a fine-scale map of introgression between French Large White (FLW) and Chinese pigs. We show that FLW pigs had historical admixture with both Southern Chinese (SCN) and Eastern Chinese (ECN) pigs ∼200-300 years ago. Moreover, a set of SCN haplotypes was shown to be beneficial for improving disease resistance and ECN haplotypes are favorable for improved reproductive performance in FLW pigs. In addition, we confirm human-mediated introgression events at the AHR locus, at which the haplotype of most likely ECN origin contributes to increased fertility of FLW pigs. Conclusions: This study advances our understanding of the breeding history of global domestic pigs and highlights the importance of artificial introgression in the formation of phenotypic characteristics in domestic animals. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Animals; Disease Resistance; Fertility; Genetic Introgression; Haplotypes; Polymorphism, Genetic; Selective Breeding; Swine; adult; AHR gene; animal reproductive procedures; Article; breeding; China; disease resistance; domestic pig; Eurasian wild boar; fertility; French Large White; gene; gene locus; haplotype; human; immunity; introgression; male; nonhuman; pig; priority journal; whole genome sequencing; Yorkshire pig; animal; fertility; genetic polymorphism; genetics; immunology; physiology; selective breeding","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081532382"

For the classification of DLBCL subtypes, as well as for providing a prognosis of the clinical outcome, the analysis of the tumor microenvironment and, particularly, of the different types and functions of tumor-associated macrophages is indispensable. Until now, however, most information about macrophages has been obtained either in a completely indirect way by gene expression profiling or by manual counts in immunohistochemically (IHC) fluorescence-stained tissue samples while automated recognition of single IHC stained macrophages remains a difficult task. In an accompanying publication, a reliable approach to this problem has been established, and a large set of related images has been generated and analyzed. Results: Provided image data comprise (i) fluorescence microscopy images of 44 multiple immunohistostained DLBCL tumor subregions, captured at 4 channels corresponding to CD14, CD163, Pax5, and DAPI; (ii) ""cartoon-like"" total variation-filtered versions of these images, generated by Rudin-Osher-Fatemi denoising; (iii) an automatically generated mask of the evaluation subregion, based on information from the DAPI channel; and (iv) automatically generated segmentation masks for macrophages (using information from CD14 and CD163 channels), B-cells (using information from Pax5 channel), and all cell nuclei (using information from DAPI channel).

However, owing to various limitations in experiments, the RNA-seq data are missing in many samples while there exist high-quality of DNA methylation data. Because DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification to regulate gene expression, it can be used to predict RNA-seq data. For this purpose, many methods have been developed. A common limitation of these methods is that they mainly focus on a single cancer dataset and do not fully utilize information from large pan-cancer datasets. Results: Here, we have developed a novel method to impute missing gene expression data from DNA methylation data through a transfer learning-based neural network, namely, TDimpute. In the method, the pan-cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was utilized for training a general model, which was then fine-tuned on the specific cancer dataset. By testing on 16 cancer datasets, we found that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy with a 7-11% improvement under different missing rates. The imputed gene expression was further proved to be useful for downstream analyses, including the identification of both methylation-driving and prognosis-related genes, clustering analysis, and survival analysis on the TCGA dataset. More importantly, our method was indicated to be useful for general purposes by an independent test on the Wilms tumor dataset from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) project. Conclusions: TDimpute is an effective method for RNA-seq imputation with limited training samples. © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.

These datasets can be considered as representations of the landscape of all possible disease conditions, in which a concrete disease state develops through stereotypical routes, characterized by ""points of no return""and ""final states""(such as lethal or recovery states). Extracting this information directly from the data remains challenging, especially in the case of synchronic (with a short-term follow-up) observations. Results: Here we suggest a semi-supervised methodology for the analysis of large clinical datasets, characterized by mixed data types and missing values, through modeling the geometrical data structure as a bouquet of bifurcating clinical trajectories. The methodology is based on application of elastic principal graphs, which can address simultaneously the tasks of dimensionality reduction, data visualization, clustering, feature selection, and quantifying the geodesic distances (pseudo-time) in partially ordered sequences of observations. The methodology allows a patient to be positioned on a particular clinical trajectory (pathological scenario) and the degree of progression along it to be characterized with a qualitative estimate of the uncertainty of the prognosis. We developed a tool ClinTrajan for clinical trajectory analysis implemented in the Python programming language. We test the methodology in 2 large publicly available datasets: Myocardial infarction complications and readmission of diabetic patients data.

Despite the common occurrence of these globally altered patterns of gene expression in polyploids, the mechanisms involved are not well understood. Results: Using a precisely defined framework of highly conserved syntenic genes on hexaploid wheat chromosome 3DL and its progenitor 3 L chromosome arm of diploid Aegilops tauschii, we show that 70% of these gene pairs exhibited proportionately reduced gene expression, in which expression in the hexaploid context of the 3DL genes was ~40% of the levels observed in diploid Ae tauschii. Several genes showed elevated expression during the later stages of grain development in wheat compared with Ae tauschii. Gene sequence and methylation differences probably accounted for only a few cases of differences in gene expression. In contrast, chromosome-wide patterns of reduced chromatin accessibility of genes in the hexaploid chromosome arm compared with its diploid progenitor were correlated with both reduced gene expression and the imposition of new patterns of gene expression. Conclusions: Our pilot-scale analyses show that chromatin compaction may orchestrate reduced gene expression levels in the hexaploid chromosome arm of wheat compared to its diploid progenitor chromosome arm. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

These techniques have the potential to enrich our understanding of bacterial species relevant to human health, such as antibiotic-resistant pathogens. However, owing to the novelty of these techniques, their use is still confined to addressing very particular applications, and their availability is limited owing to associated costs and required expertise. Among these, scattering-type scanning near field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) has been demonstrated as a powerful tool for exploring important optical properties at nanoscale resolution, depending only on the size of a sharp tip. Despite its huge potential to resolve aspects that cannot be tackled otherwise, the penetration of s-SNOM into the life sciences is still proceeding at a slow pace for the aforementioned reasons. Results: In this work we introduce SSNOMBACTER, a set of s-SNOM images collected on 15 bacterial species. These come accompanied by registered Atomic Force Microscopy images, which are useful for placing nanoscale optical information in a relevant topographic context. Conclusions: The proposed dataset aims to augment the popularity of s-SNOM and for accelerating its penetration in life sciences. Furthermore, we consider this dataset to be useful for the development and benchmarking of image analysis tools dedicated to s-SNOM imaging, which are scarce, despite the high need. In this latter context we discuss a series of image processing and analysis applications where SSNOMBACTER could be of help.  © 2020 The Author(s).

Important applications include long-term storage and compression-based data analysis. In the literature, only a few recent articles propose the use of neural networks for DNA sequence compression. However, they fall short when compared with specific DNA compression tools, such as GeCo2. This limitation is due to the absence of models specifically designed for DNA sequences. In this work, we combine the power of neural networks with specific DNA models. For this purpose, we created GeCo3, a new genomic sequence compressor that uses neural networks for mixing multiple context and substitution-tolerant context models. Findings: We benchmark GeCo3 as a reference-free DNA compressor in 5 datasets, including a balanced and comprehensive dataset of DNA sequences, the Y-chromosome and human mitogenome, 2 compilations of archaeal and virus genomes, 4 whole genomes, and 2 collections of FASTQ data of a human virome and ancient DNA. GeCo3 achieves a solid improvement in compression over the previous version (GeCo2) of 2.4%, 7.1%, 6.1%, 5.8%, and 6.0%, respectively. To test its performance as a reference-based DNA compressor, we benchmark GeCo3 in 4 datasets constituted by the pairwise compression of the chromosomes of the genomes of several primates. GeCo3 improves the compression in 12.4%, 11.7%, 10.8%, and 10.1% over the state of the art. The cost of this compression improvement is some additional computational time (1.7-3 times slower than GeCo2). The RAM use is constant, and the tool scales efficiently, independently of the sequence size. Overall, these values outperform the state of the art. Conclusions: GeCo3 is a genomic sequence compressor with a neural network mixing approach that provides additional gains over top specific genomic compressors. The proposed mixing method is portable, requiring only the probabilities of the models as inputs, providing easy adaptation to other data compressors or compression-based data analysis tools.

However, it is highly fragmented, preventing the integration of genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic information to fully elucidate walnut biological processes. Findings: Here, we report the new chromosome-scale assembly of the walnut reference genome (Chandler v2.0) obtained by combining Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing with chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technology. Relative to the previous reference genome, the new assembly features an 84.4-fold increase in N50 size, with the 16 chromosomal pseudomolecules assembled and representing 95% of its total length. Using full-length transcripts from single-molecule real-time sequencing, we predicted 37,554 gene models, with a mean gene length higher than the previous gene annotations. Most of the new protein-coding genes (90%) present both start and stop codons, which represents a significant improvement compared with Chandler v1.0 (only 48%). We then tested the potential impact of the new chromosome-level genome on different areas of walnut research. By studying the proteome changes occurring during male flower development, we observed that the virtual proteome obtained from Chandler v2.0 presents fewer artifacts than the previous reference genome, enabling the identification of a new potential pollen allergen in walnut.

These models make the prediction of tissue-level response to drug treatment possible, which can lead to new therapies and improved patient outcomes. Here we present a data-driven multiscale modeling framework to study molecular interactions between cancer, stromal, and immune cells found in the tumor microenvironment. We also develop methods to use molecular data available in The Cancer Genome Atlas to generate sample-specific models of cancer. Results: By combining published models of different cells relevant to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we built an agent-based model of the multicellular pancreatic tumor microenvironment, formally describing cell type-specific molecular interactions and cytokine-mediated cell-cell communications. We used an ensemble-based modeling approach to systematically explore how variations in the tumor microenvironment affect the viability of cancer cells. The results suggest that the autocrine loop involving EGF signaling is a key interaction modulator between pancreatic cancer and stellate cells. EGF is also found to be associated with previously described subtypes of PDAC. Moreover, the model allows a systematic exploration of the effect of possible therapeutic perturbations; our simulations suggest that reducing bFGF secretion by stellate cells will have, on average, a positive impact on cancer apoptosis. Conclusions: The developed framework allows model-driven hypotheses to be generated regarding therapeutically relevant PDAC states with potential molecular and cellular drivers indicating specific intervention strategies. © The Author(s) 2020.

In particular, the Oxford Nanopore Technology sequencing platforms have become more popular in recent years owing to their relatively high affordability and portability compared with other third-generation sequencing technologies. To aid the development of analytical tools that leverage the power of this technology, simulated data provide a cost-effective solution with ground truth. However, a nanopore sequence simulator targeting transcriptomic data is not available yet. Findings: We introduce Trans-NanoSim, a tool that simulates reads with technical and transcriptome-specific features learnt from nanopore RNA-sequncing data. We comprehensively benchmarked Trans-NanoSim on direct RNA and complementary DNA datasets describing human and mouse transcriptomes. Through comparison against other nanopore read simulators, we show the unique advantage and robustness of Trans-NanoSim in capturing the characteristics of nanopore complementary DNA and direct RNA reads. Conclusions: As a cost-effective alternative to sequencing real transcriptomes, Trans-NanoSim will facilitate the rapid development of analytical tools for nanopore RNA-sequencing data.

Despite this importance, the genomic resources for baboons are limited. In particular, the current baboon reference genome Panu 3.0 is a highly fragmented, reference-guided (i.e., not fully de novo) assembly, and its poor quality inhibits our ability to conduct downstream genomic analyses. Findings: Here we present a de novo genome assembly of the olive baboon (Papio anubis) that uses data from several recently developed single-molecule technologies. Our assembly, Panubis1.0, has an N50 contig size of ∼1.46 Mb (as opposed to 139 kb for Panu 3.0) and has single scaffolds that span each of the 20 autosomes and the X chromosome. Conclusions: We highlight multiple lines of evidence (including Bionano Genomics data, pedigree linkage information, and linkage disequilibrium data) suggesting that there are several large assembly errors in Panu 3.0, which have been corrected in Panubis1.0. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

All this information is supposed to be accessible and, if possible, browsable afterwards. Computational biologists have been dealing with this scenario for more than a decade and have been implementing software and databases to meet this challenge. The GMOD's (Generic Model Organism Database) biological relational database schema, known as Chado, is one of the few successful open source initiatives; it is widely adopted and many software packages are able to connect to it. Findings: We have been developing an open source software package named Machado, a genomics data integration framework implemented in Python, to enable research groups to both store and visualize genomics data. The framework relies on the Chado database schema and, therefore, should be very intuitive for current developers to adopt it or have it running on top of already existing databases. It has several data-loading tools for genomics and transcriptomics data and also for annotation results from tools such as BLAST, InterproScan, OrthoMCL, and LSTrAP. There is an API to connect to JBrowse, and a web visualization tool is implemented using Django Views and Templates. The Haystack library integrated with the ElasticSearch engine was used to implement a Google-like search, i.e., single auto-complete search box that provides fast results and filters. Conclusion: Machado aims to be a modern object-relational framework that uses the latest Python libraries to produce an effective open source resource for genomics research.  © The Author(s) 2020.","Databases, Genetic; Genome; Genomics; Software; Article; conceptual framework; data base; data integration; data visualization; gene mapping; gene sequence; genomics; information processing; information storage; multiomics; priority journal; software; transcriptomics; genetic database; genome","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091054426"

Recently, generating the first multi-omic dataset for atypical pulmonary carcinoids and the first methylation dataset for large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas led us to the discovery of clinically relevant molecular groups, as well as a new entity of pulmonary carcinoids (supra-carcinoids). Results: To promote the integration of LNENs molecular data, we provide here detailed information on data generation and quality control for whole-genome/exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and EPIC 850K methylation arrays for a total of 84 patients with LNENs. We integrate the transcriptomic data with other previously published data and generate the first comprehensive molecular map of LNENs using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimension reduction technique. We show that this map captures the main biological findings of previous studies and can be used as reference to integrate datasets for which RNA sequencing is available. The generated map can be interactively explored and interrogated on the UCSC TumorMap portal (https://tumormap.ucsc.edu/?p=RCG lungNENomics/LNEN). The data, source code, and compute environments used to generate and evaluate the map as well as the raw data are available, respectively, in a Nextjournal interactive notebook (https://nextjournal.com/rarecancersgenomics/a-molecular-map-of-lung-neuroendocrine-neoplasms/) and at the EMBL-EBI European Genome-phenome Archive and Gene Expression Omnibus data repositories.

Our results demonstrate that previous coronavirus outbreaks have been understudied compared with other viruses. We also show that the research volume of emerging infectious diseases is very high after an outbreak and decreases drastically upon the containment of the disease. This can yield inadequate research and limited investment in gaining a full understanding of novel coronavirus management and prevention.

However, the lack of a reference genome has limited insights into the genetic basis for these phenomena. Therefore, we assembled a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome of the European wasp spider as a tool for more in-depth future studies. Findings: We generated, de novo, a 1.67 Gb genome assembly of A. bruennichi using 21.8× Pacific Biosciences sequencing, polished with 19.8× Illumina paired-end sequencing data, and proximity ligation (Hi-C)-based scaffolding. This resulted in an N50 scaffold size of 124 Mb and an N50 contig size of 288 kb. We found 98.4% of the genome to be contained in 13 scaffolds, fitting the expected number of chromosomes (n = 13). Analyses showed the presence of 91.1% of complete arthropod BUSCOs, indicating a high-quality assembly. Conclusions: We present the first chromosome-level genome assembly in the order Araneae. With this genomic resource, we open the door for more precise and informative studies on evolution and adaptation not only in A. bruennichi but also in arachnids overall, shedding light on questions such as the genomic architecture of traits, whole-genome duplication, and the genomic mechanisms behind silk and venom evolution. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Results: We present here a scalable pre-assembly binning scheme (i.e., operating on unassembled short reads) enabling latent genome recovery by leveraging sparse dictionary learning and elastic-net regularization, and its use to recover hundreds of metagenome-assembled genomes, including very low-abundance genomes, from a joint analysis of microbiomes from the LifeLines DEEP population cohort (n = 1,135, >1010 reads). Conclusion: We showed that sparse coding techniques can be leveraged to carry out read-level binning at large scale and that, despite lower genome reconstruction yields compared to assembly-based approaches, bin-first strategies can complement the more widely used assembly-first protocols by targeting distinct genome segregation profiles. Read enrichment levels across 6 orders of magnitude in relative abundance were observed, indicating that the method has the power to recover genomes consistently segregating at low levels. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Cluster Analysis; Genome, Bacterial; Humans; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Software; article; cohort analysis; covariance; elastic tissue; learning; major clinical study; metagenome; metagenomics; microbiome; nonhuman; remission; bacterial genome; cluster analysis; genetics; human; metagenomics; procedures; software","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082561891"

Previous methods describing Hi-C experiments have focused on the industry-standard Illumina sequencing. With new next-generation sequencing platforms such as BGISEQ-500 becoming more widely available, protocol adaptations to fit platform-specific requirements are useful to give increased choice to researchers who routinely generate sequencing data. Results: We describe an in situ Hi-C protocol adapted to be compatible with the BGISEQ-500 high-throughput sequencing platform. Using zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) as a biological sample, we demonstrate how Hi-C libraries can be constructed to generate informative data using the BGISEQ-500 platform, following circularization and DNA nanoball generation. Our protocol is a modification of an Illumina-compatible method, based around blunt-end ligations in library construction, using un-barcoded, distally overhanging double-stranded adapters, followed by amplification using indexed primers.

We used nanopore technology to generate chromosome-level assemblies for 3 different strains of Drechmeria coniospora, a nematophagous fungus used extensively in the study of innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Results: One natural geographical isolate demonstrated high stability over decades, whereas a second isolate not only had a profoundly altered genome structure but exhibited extensive instability. We conducted an in-depth analysis of sequence errors within the 3 genomes and established that even with state-of-the-art tools, nanopore methods alone are insufficient to generate eukaryotic genome sequences of sufficient accuracy to merit inclusion in public databases. Conclusions: Although nanopore long-read sequencing is not accurate enough to produce publishable eukaryotic genomes, in our case, it has revealed new information about genome plasticity in D. coniospora and provided a backbone that will permit future detailed study to characterize gene evolution in this important model fungal pathogen.  © The Author(s) 2020.","Chromosomes; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Hypocreales; Nanopores; Sequence Analysis, DNA; fungal DNA; Article; Caenorhabditis elegans; chromosome plasticity; chromosomes and chromosomal phenomena; comparative study; controlled study; data base; DNA sequencing; Drechmeria coniospora; fungal gene; fungal genome; fungal strain; fungus isolation; gene sequence; genomic instability; geographic distribution; Hypocreales; innate immunity; long read sequencing; nanopore sequencing; nanotechnology; nonhuman; priority journal; chromosome; DNA sequence; high throughput sequencing; Hypocreales; nanopore","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091324003"

Finding associations between epigenetic variation and phenotype is a significant challenge in biomedical research. The newest version, HumanMethylationEPIC, quantifies the DNA methylation level of 850,000 CpG sites, while the previous versions, HumanMethylation450 and HumanMethylation27, measured >450,000 and 27,000 loci, respectively.

Results: We have developed a pipeline for the Galaxy platform for those without experience aimed at DNA methylation analysis using the Infinium Human Methylation BeadChip. Our tool is integrated into Galaxy (http://galaxyproject.org), a web-based platform. This allows users to analyse data from the Infinium Human Methylation BeadChip in the easiest possible way.

It is often first choice for police and military work, as well as protection, disability assistance, and search-and-rescue. Yet, GSDs are well known to be susceptible to a range of genetic diseases that can interfere with their training. Such diseases are of particular concern when they occur later in life, and fully trained animals are not able to continue their duties. Findings: Here, we provide the draft genome sequence of a healthy German Shepherd female as a reference for future disease and evolutionary studies. We generated this improved canid reference genome (CanFam-GSD) utilizing a combination of Pacific Bioscience, Oxford Nanopore, 10X Genomics, Bionano, and Hi-C technologies. The GSD assembly is ∼80 times as contiguous as the current canid reference genome (20.9 vs 0.267 Mb contig N50), containing far fewer gaps (306 vs 23,876) and fewer scaffolds (429 vs 3,310) than the current canid reference genome CanFamv3.1. Two chromosomes (4 and 35) are assembled into single scaffolds with no gaps. BUSCO analyses of the genome assembly results show that 93.0% of the conserved single-copy genes are complete in the GSD assembly compared with 92.2% for CanFam v3.1. Homology-based gene annotation increases this value to ∼99%. Detailed examination of the evolutionarily important pancreatic amylase region reveals that there are most likely 7 copies of the gene, indicative of a duplication of 4 ancestral copies and the disruption of 1 copy. Conclusions: GSD genome assembly and annotation were produced with major improvement in completeness, continuity, and quality over the existing canid reference. This resource will enable further research related to canine diseases, the evolutionary relationships of canids, and other aspects of canid biology. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Animals; Chromosomes; Dogs; Genome; Genomics; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Whole Genome Sequencing; alpha amylase pancreas isoenzyme; Article; chromosome 4; chromosome size; evolution; female; gene dosage; gene duplication; gene mapping; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic disorder; German shepherd; nonhuman; priority journal; standard; animal; chromosome; DNA sequence; dog; genetics; genome; genomics; molecular genetics; procedures; whole genome sequencing","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082730161"

Our data analysis steps include pre-processing of MSI data, cluster analysis, drug local indicators of spatial association (LISA) map, and ions selection. Results: The number of clusters identified from different tumor tissues. The spatial homogeneity of the individual cluster was measured using a modified version of our drug homogeneity method. The clustered image and drug LISA map were simultaneously analyzed to link identified clusters with observed drug distribution profile. Finally, ions selection was performed using the spatially aware method.

This diverse group of specialized predators has evolved many adaptations including proteinaceous venom. Of particular interest is the blue-ringed octopus genus (Hapalochlaena), which are the only octopods known to store large quantities of the potent neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin, within their tissues and venom gland. Findings: To reveal genomic correlates of organismal novelties, we conducted a comparative study of 3 octopod genomes, including the Southern blue-ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena maculosa). We present the genome of this species and reveal highly dynamic evolutionary patterns at both non-coding and coding organizational levels. Gene family expansions previously reported in Octopus bimaculoides (e.g., zinc finger and cadherins, both associated with neural functions), as well as formation of novel gene families, dominate the genomic landscape in all octopods. Examination of tissue-specific genes in the posterior salivary gland revealed that expression was dominated by serine proteases in non-tetrodotoxin-bearing octopods, while this family was a minor component in H. maculosa. Moreover, voltage-gated sodium channels in H. maculosa contain a resistance mutation found in pufferfish and garter snakes, which is exclusive to the genus. Analysis of the posterior salivary gland microbiome revealed a diverse array of bacterial species, including genera that can produce tetrodotoxin, suggestive of a possible production source. Conclusions: We present the first tetrodotoxin-bearing octopod genome H. maculosa, which displays lineage-specific adaptations to tetrodotoxin acquisition. This genome, along with other recently published cephalopod genomes, represents a valuable resource from which future work could advance our understanding of the evolution of genomic novelty in this family.  © 2020 The Author(s).

Nevertheless, the workflows used differ depending on the applied camera, the plants being imaged, the experience of the users, and the measurement set-up. Results: This review describes a general workflow for the assessment and processing of hyperspectral plant data at greenhouse and laboratory scale. Aiming at a detailed description of possible error sources, a comprehensive literature review of possibilities to overcome these errors and influences is provided. The processing of hyperspectral data of plants starting from the hardware sensor calibration, the software processing steps to overcome sensor inaccuracies, and the preparation for machine learning is shown and described in detail. Furthermore, plant traits extracted from spectral hypercubes are categorized to standardize the terms used when describing hyperspectral traits in plant phenotyping. A scientific data perspective is introduced covering information for canopy, single organs, plant development, and also combined traits coming from spectral and 3D measuring devices. Conclusions: This publication provides a structured overview on implementing hyperspectral imaging into biological studies at greenhouse and laboratory scale.

Ongoing rapid accumulation of stored data calls for a more efficient compression tool. Although numerous compressors exist, both specialized and general-purpose, choosing one of them was difficult because no comprehensive analysis of their comparative advantages for sequence compression was available. Findings: We systematically benchmarked 430 settings of 48 compressors (including 29 specialized sequence compressors and 19 general-purpose compressors) on representative FASTA-formatted datasets of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. Each compressor was evaluated on 17 performance measures, including compression strength, as well as time and memory required for compression and decompression. We used 27 test datasets including individual genomes of various sizes, DNA and RNA datasets, and standard protein datasets. We summarized the results as the Sequence Compression Benchmark database (SCB database, http://kirr.dyndns.org/sequence-compression-benchmark/), which allows custom visualizations to be built for selected subsets of benchmark results. Conclusion: We found that modern compressors offer a large improvement in compactness and speed compared to gzip. Our benchmark allows compressors and their settings to be compared using a variety of performance measures, offering the opportunity to select the optimal compressor on the basis of the data type and usage scenario specific to a particular application. © The Author(s) 2020.

The machine-learning community have developed myriad classification algorithms, which are used in diverse life science research domains. Algorithm choice can affect classification accuracy dramatically, so it is crucial that researchers optimize the choice of which algorithm(s) to apply in a given research domain on the basis of empirical evidence. In benchmark studies, multiple algorithms are applied to multiple datasets, and the researcher examines overall trends. In addition, the researcher may evaluate multiple hyperparameter combinations for each algorithm and use feature selection to reduce data dimensionality. Although software implementations of classification algorithms are widely available, robust benchmark comparisons are difficult to perform when researchers wish to compare algorithms that span multiple software packages. Programming interfaces, data formats, and evaluation procedures differ across software packages; and dependency conflicts may arise during installation. Findings: To address these challenges, we created ShinyLearner, an open-source project for integrating machine-learning packages into software containers. ShinyLearner provides a uniform interface for performing classification, irrespective of the library that implements each algorithm, thus facilitating benchmark comparisons. In addition, ShinyLearner enables researchers to optimize hyperparameters and select features via nested cross-validation; it tracks all nested operations and generates output files that make these steps transparent. ShinyLearner includes a Web interface to help users more easily construct the commands necessary to perform benchmark comparisons. ShinyLearner is freely available at https://github.com/srp33/ShinyLearner. Conclusions: This software is a resource to researchers who wish to benchmark multiple classification or feature-selection algorithms on a given dataset. We hope it will serve as example of combining the benefits of software containerization with a user-friendly approach. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Humans; Machine Learning; Software; algorithm; Article; benchmarking; classification; data analysis; data processing; machine learning; prediction; priority journal; process optimization; scientist; software; trend study; validation process; benchmarking; human; machine learning; procedures; software","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083071917"

These experiments can be combined into compendia and analyzed collectively to extract novel biological patterns. Technical variability, or ""batch effects,""may result from combining samples collected and processed at different times and in different settings. Such variability may distort our ability to extract true underlying biological patterns. As more integrative analysis methods arise and data collections get bigger, we must determine how technical variability affects our ability to detect desired patterns when many experiments are combined. Objective: We sought to determine the extent to which an underlying signal was masked by technical variability by simulating compendia comprising data aggregated across multiple experiments. Method: We developed a generative multi-layer neural network to simulate compendia of gene expression experiments from large-scale microbial and human datasets. We compared simulated compendia before and after introducing varying numbers of sources of undesired variability. Results: The signal from a baseline compendium was obscured when the number of added sources of variability was small. Applying statistical correction methods rescued the underlying signal in these cases. However, as the number of sources of variability increased, it became easier to detect the original signal even without correction. In fact, statistical correction reduced our power to detect the underlying signal. Conclusion: When combining a modest number of experiments, it is best to correct for experiment-specific noise. However, when many experiments are combined, statistical correction reduces our ability to extract underlying patterns.  © 2020 The Author(s).

A current challenge is to predict transcription factor (TF) regulation from single-cell RNA data. RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel approach for predicting gene expression at the single-cell level using cis-regulatory motifs, as well as epigenetic features. We designed a tree-guided multi-task learning framework that considers each cell as a task. Through this framework we were able to explain the single-cell gene expression values using either TF binding affinities or TF ChIP-seq data measured at specific genomic regions. TFs identified using these models could be validated by the literature. CONCLUSION: Our proposed method allows us to identify distinct TFs that show cell type-specific regulation. This approach is not limited to TFs but can use any type of data that can potentially be used in explaining gene expression at the single-cell level to study factors that drive differentiation or show abnormal regulation in disease.

This is especially relevant to non-model mammals, where the samples to be sequenced are often degraded and of low quality. A key aspect when planning a genome project is the choice of sequencing data to generate. This decision is driven by several factors, including the biological questions being asked, the quality of DNA available, and the availability of funds. Cutting-edge sequencing technologies now make it possible to achieve highly contiguous, chromosome-level genome assemblies, but rely on high-quality high molecular weight DNA. However, funding is often insufficient for many independent research groups to use these techniques. Here we use a range of different genomic technologies generated from a roadkill European polecat (Mustela putorius) to assess various assembly techniques on this low-quality sample. We evaluated different approaches for de novo assemblies and discuss their value in relation to biological analyses. Results: Generally, assemblies containing more data types achieved better scores in our ranking system. However, when accounting for misassemblies, this was not always the case for Bionano and low-coverage 10x Genomics (for scaffolding only). We also find that the extra cost associated with combining multiple data types is not necessarily associated with better genome assemblies. Conclusions: The high degree of variability between each de novo assembly method (assessed from the 7 key metrics) highlights the importance of carefully devising the sequencing strategy to be able to carry out the desired analysis. Adding more data to genome assemblies does not always result in better assemblies, so it is important to understand the nuances of genomic data integration explained here, in order to obtain cost-effective value for money when sequencing genomes. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Many steps are required to obtain taxonomically assigned matrices from raw data. For most of these, a plethora of tools are available; each tool's execution parameters need to be tailored to reflect each experiment's idiosyncrasy. Adding to this complexity, the computation capacity of high-performance computing systems is frequently required for such analyses. To address the difficulties, bioinformatic pipelines need to combine state-of-the art technologies and algorithms with an easy to get-set-use framework, allowing researchers to tune each study. Software containerization technologies ease the sharing and running of software packages across operating systems; thus, they strongly facilitate pipeline development and usage. Likewise programming languages specialized for big data pipelines incorporate features like roll-back checkpoints and on-demand partial pipeline execution. Findings: PEMA is a containerized assembly of key metabarcoding analysis tools that requires low effort in setting up, running, and customizing to researchers' needs. Based on third-party tools, PEMA performs read pre-processing, (molecular) operational taxonomic unit clustering, amplicon sequence variant inference, and taxonomy assignment for 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA, as well as ITS and COI marker gene data. Owing to its simplified parameterization and checkpoint support, PEMA allows users to explore alternative algorithms for specific steps of the pipeline without the need of a complete re-execution. PEMA was evaluated against both mock communities and previously published datasets and achieved results of comparable quality. Conclusions: A high-performance computing-based approach was used to develop PEMA; however, it can be used in personal computers as well. PEMA's time-efficient performance and good results will allow it to be used for accurate environmental DNA metabarcoding analysis, thus enhancing the applicability of next-generation biodiversity assessment studies. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Animals; Archaea; Bacteria; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; Electron Transport Complex IV; Environmental DNA; Fungi; Metagenomics; Plants; Reference Standards; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; RNA, Ribosomal, 18S; Sensitivity and Specificity; Software; environmental DNA; RNA 16S; RNA 18S; cytochrome c oxidase; RNA 16S; RNA 18S; algorithm; amplicon; Article; bioinformatics; computer language; DNA barcoding; DNA determination; gene; gene sequence; genetic variability; nonhuman; priority journal; software; taxonomy; technology; animal; archaeon; bacterium; chemistry; DNA barcoding; fungus; genetics; metagenomics; plant; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; standard","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081932814"

Current fruit phenotyping approaches for external characteristics in strawberry often rely on the human eye to make categorical assessments. However, fruit shape is an inherently multi-dimensional, continuously variable trait and not adequately described by a single categorical or quantitative feature. Morphometric approaches enable the study of complex, multi-dimensional forms but are often abstract and difficult to interpret. In this study, we developed a mathematical approach for transforming fruit shape classifications from digital images onto an ordinal scale called the Principal Progression of k Clusters (PPKC). We use these human-recognizable shape categories to select quantitative features extracted from multiple morphometric analyses that are best fit for genetic dissection and analysis. Results: We transformed images of strawberry fruit into human-recognizable categories using unsupervised machine learning, discovered 4 principal shape categories, and inferred progression using PPKC. We extracted 68 quantitative features from digital images of strawberries using a suite of morphometric analyses and multivariate statistical approaches. These analyses defined informative feature sets that effectively captured quantitative differences between shape classes. Classification accuracy ranged from 68% to 99% for the newly created phenotypic variables for describing a shape. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that strawberry fruit shapes could be robustly quantified, accurately classified, and empirically ordered using image analyses, machine learning, and PPKC. We generated a dictionary of quantitative traits for studying and predicting shape classes and identifying genetic factors underlying phenotypic variability for fruit shape in strawberry.

It forms the basis of a valuable commercial fishery and plays a key role in coastal ecosystems and food webs. Like other filter feeding bivalves it can accumulate potent phytotoxins, to which it has evolved some immunity. The molecular origins of this immunity are of interest to evolutionary biologists, pharmaceutical companies, and fisheries management. Findings: Here we report the genome assembly of this species, conducted as part of the Wellcome Sanger 25 Genomes Project. This genome was assembled from PacBio reads and scaffolded with 10X Chromium and Hi-C data. Its 3,983 scaffolds have an N50 of 44.8 Mb (longest scaffold 60.1 Mb), with 92% of the assembly sequence contained in 19 scaffolds, corresponding to the 19 chromosomes found in this species. The total assembly spans 918.3 Mb and is the best-scaffolded marine bivalve genome published to date, exhibiting 95.5% recovery of the metazoan BUSCO set. Gene annotation resulted in 67,741 gene models. Analysis of gene content revealed large numbers of gene duplicates, as previously seen in bivalves, with little gene loss, in comparison with the sequenced genomes of other marine bivalve species. Conclusions: The genome assembly of P. maximus and its annotated gene set provide a high-quality platform for studies on such disparate topics as shell biomineralization, pigmentation, vision, and resistance to algal toxins. As a result of our findings we highlight the sodium channel gene Nav1, known to confer resistance to saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin, as a candidate for further studies investigating immunity to domoic acid. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Researchers compose pipelines in Galaxy to analyse scientific data. These pipelines, also known as workflows, can be complex and difficult to create from thousands of tools, especially for researchers new to Galaxy. To help researchers with creating workflows, a system is developed to recommend tools that can facilitate further data analysis. Findings: A model is developed to recommend tools using a deep learning approach by analysing workflows composed by researchers on the European Galaxy server. The higher-order dependencies in workflows, represented as directed acyclic graphs, are learned by training a gated recurrent units neural network, a variant of a recurrent neural network. In the neural network training, the weights of tools used are derived from their usage frequencies over time and the sequences of tools are uniformly sampled from training data. Hyperparameters of the neural network are optimized using Bayesian optimization. Mean accuracy of 98% in recommending tools is achieved for the top-1 metric. Conclusions: The model is accessed by a Galaxy API to provide researchers with recommended tools in an interactive manner using multiple user interface integrations on the European Galaxy server.

The genome sequence of DM1-3 516 R44, a doubled monoploid clone of S. tuberosum Group Phureja, was published in 2011 using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach with short-read sequence data. Current advanced sequencing technologies now permit generation of near-complete, high-quality chromosome-scale genome assemblies at minimal cost. Findings: Here, we present an updated version of the DM1-3 516 R44 genome sequence (v6.1) using Oxford Nanopore Technologies long reads coupled with proximity-by-ligation scaffolding (Hi-C), yielding a chromosome-scale assembly. The new (v6.1) assembly represents 741.6 Mb of sequence (87.8%) of the estimated 844 Mb genome, of which 741.5 Mb is non-gapped with 731.2 Mb anchored to the 12 chromosomes. Use of Oxford Nanopore Technologies full-length complementary DNA sequencing enabled annotation of 32,917 high-confidence protein-coding genes encoding 44,851 gene models that had a significantly improved representation of conserved orthologs compared with the previous annotation. The new assembly has improved contiguity with a 595-fold increase in N50 contig size, 99% reduction in the number of contigs, a 44-fold increase in N50 scaffold size, and an LTR Assembly Index score of 13.56, placing it in the category of reference genome quality. The improved assembly also permitted annotation of the centromeres via alignment to sequencing reads derived from CENH3 nucleosomes. Conclusions: Access to advanced sequencing technologies and improved software permitted generation of a high-quality, long-read, chromosome-scale assembly and improved annotation dataset for the reference genotype of potato that will facilitate research aimed at improving agronomic traits and understanding genome evolution.  © The Author(s) 2020.","Chromosomes; Genome; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Nanopore Sequencing; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Solanum tuberosum; complementary DNA; agronomic trait; Article; centromere; chromatin assembly and disassembly; chromosome structure; controlled study; DNA sequencing; gene sequence; genetic code; genotype; molecular genetics; nonhuman; nucleosome; plant evolution; plant genome; potato; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); sequencing by ligation; chromosome; DNA sequence; genetics; genome; potato","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091560221"

Findings: Here we present Biospytial, a modular open source knowledge engine designed to import, organise, analyse and visualise big spatial ecological datasets using the power of graph theory. The engine uses a hybrid graph-relational approach to store and access information. A graph data structure uses linkage relationships to build semantic structures represented as complex data structures stored in a graph database, while tabular and geospatial data are stored in an efficient spatial relational database system. We provide an application using information on species occurrences, their taxonomic classification and climatic datasets. We built a knowledge graph of the Tree of Life embedded in an environmental and geographical grid to perform an analysis on threatened species co-occurring with jaguars (Panthera onca). Conclusions: The Biospytial approach reduces the complexity of joining datasets using multiple tabular relations, while its scalable design eases the problem of merging datasets from different sources. Its modular design makes it possible to distribute several instances simultaneously, allowing fast and efficient handling of big ecological datasets. The provided example demonstrates the engine's capabilities in performing basic graph manipulation, analysis and visualizations of taxonomic groups co-occurring in space. The example shows potential avenues for performing novel ecological analyses, biodiversity syntheses and species distribution models aided by a network of taxonomic and spatial relationships. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Studies of genetic adaptations to high elevations have been largely limited to terrestrial animals. How fish adapt to high-elevation environments is largely unknown. Triplophysa bleekeri, an endemic fish inhabiting high-altitude regions, is an excellent model to investigate the genetic mechanisms of adaptation to the local environment. Here, we assembled a chromosomal genome sequence of T. bleekeri, with a size of ∼628 Mb (contig and scaffold N50 of 3.1 and 22.9 Mb, respectively). We investigated the origin and environmental adaptation of T. bleekeri based on 21,198 protein-coding genes in the genome. Results: Compared with fish species living at low altitudes, gene families associated with lipid metabolism and immune response were significantly expanded in the T. bleekeri genome. Genes involved in DNA repair exhibit positive selection for T. bleekeri, Triplophysa siluroides, and Triplophysa tibetana, indicating that adaptive convergence in Triplophysa species occurred at the positively selected genes. We also analyzed whole-genome variants among samples from 3 populations. The results showed that populations separated by geological and artificial barriers exhibited obvious differences in genetic structures, indicating that gene flow is restricted between populations. Conclusions: These results will help us expand our understanding of environmental adaptation and genetic diversity of T. bleekeri and provide valuable genetic resources for future studies on the evolution and conservation of high-altitude fish species such as T. bleekeri.  © 2020 The Author(s).

While antibiotic treatments help cure infectious diseases in farm animals, the possibility of spreading antibiotic resistance genes into the environment and human microbiomes raises significant concerns. Through long-term evolution, antibiotic resistance genes have mutated, thereby complicating the resistance problems. Results: In this study, we performed deep sequencing of the gut microbiomes of 36 swine and 41 cattle in Korean farms, and metagenomic analysis to understand the diversity and prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes. We found that aminoglycoside, β-lactam, lincosamide, streptogramin, and tetracycline were the prevalent resistance determinants in both swine and cattle. Tetracycline resistance was abundant and prevalent in cattle and swine. Specifically, tetQ, tetW, tetO, tet32, and tet44 were the 5 most abundant and prevalent tetracycline resistance genes. Their prevalence was almost 100% in swine and cattle. While tetQ was similarly abundant in both swine and cattle, tetW was more abundant in swine than in cattle. Aminoglycoside was the second highest abundant resistance determinant in swine, but not in cattle. In particular, ANT(6) and APH(3′′) were the dominant resistance gene families in swine. β-lactam was also an abundant resistance determinant in both swine and cattle. Cfx was the major contributing gene family conferring resistance against β-lactams. Conclusions: Antibiotic resistome was more pervasive in swine than in cattle. Specifically, prevalent antibiotic resistance genes (prevalence >50%) were found more in swine than in cattle. Genomic investigation of specific resistance genes from the gut microbiomes of swine and cattle in this study should provide opportunities to better understand the exchange of antibiotic resistance genes in farm animals. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Begomoviruses, the largest, most damaging and emerging group of plant viruses, infect hundreds of plant species, and new virus species of the group are discovered each year. Begomoviruses are transmitted by members of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci species complex in a persistent-circulative manner. Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is one of the most devastating begomoviruses worldwide and causes major losses in tomato crops, as well as in many agriculturally important plant species. Different B. tabaci populations vary in their virus transmission abilities; however, the causes for these variations are attributed among others to genetic differences among vector populations, as well as to differences in the bacterial symbionts housed within B. tabaci. Results: Here, we performed discovery proteomic analyses in 9 whitefly populations from both Middle East Asia Minor I (MEAM1, formerly known as B biotype) and Mediterranean (MED, formerly known as Q biotype) species. We analysed our proteomic results on the basis of the different TYLCV transmission abilities of the various populations included in the study. The results provide the first comprehensive list of candidate insect and bacterial symbiont (mainly Rickettsia) proteins associated with virus transmission. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that the proteomic signatures of better vector populations differ considerably when compared with less efficient vector populations in the 2 whitefly species tested in this study. While MEAM1 efficient vector populations have a more lenient immune system, the Q efficient vector populations have higher abundance of proteins possibly implicated in virus passage through cells. Both species show a strong link of the facultative symbiont Rickettsia to virus transmission.  © 2020 The Author(s).

Such variability can potentially introduce dataset shifts, a data quality issue when reusing electronic health records (EHRs) for secondary purposes. Temporal data-set shifts can present as trends, as well as abrupt or seasonal changes in the statistical distributions of data over time. The latter are particularly complicated to address in multimodal and highly coded data. These changes, if not delineated, can harm population and data-driven research, such as machine learning. Given that biomedical research repositories are increasingly being populated with large sets of historical data from EHRs, there is a need for specific software methods to help delineate temporal data-set shifts to ensure reliable data reuse. Results: EHRtemporalVariability is an open-source R package and Shiny app designed to explore and identify temporal data-set shifts. EHRtemporalVariability estimates the statistical distributions of coded and numerical data over time; projects their temporal evolution through non-parametric information geometric temporal plots; and enables the exploration of changes in variables through data temporal heat maps. We demonstrate the capability of EHRtemporalVariability to delineate data-set shifts in three impact case studies, one of which is available for reproducibility. Conclusions: EHRtemporalVariability enables the exploration and identification of data-set shifts, contributing to the broad examination and repurposing of large, longitudinal data sets. Our goal is to help ensure reliable data reuse for a wide range of biomedical data users. EHRtemporalVariability is designed for technical users who are programmatically utilizing the R package, as well as users who are not familiar with programming via the Shiny user interface.  © The Author(s) 2020.","Biomedical Research; Data Accuracy; Electronic Health Records; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; electronic health record; geometry; human; information processing; medical information; medical research; population research; priority journal; reproducibility; sample size; temporal analysis; measurement accuracy; medical research; software","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089128975"

Unlike other methods of assembly for diploid genomes, this approach is enhanced, rather than hindered, by the heterozygosity of the individual sequenced. To maximize heterozygosity and simultaneously assemble reference genomes for 2 species, we applied trio binning to an interspecies F1 hybrid of yak (Bos grunniens) and cattle (Bos taurus), 2 species that diverged nearly 5 million years ago. The genomes of both of these species are composed of acrocentric autosomes. Results: We produced the most continuous haplotype-resolved assemblies for a diploid animal yet reported. Both the maternal (yak) and paternal (cattle) assemblies have the largest 2 chromosomes in single haplotigs, and more than one-third of the autosomes similarly lack gaps. The maximum length haplotig produced was 153 Mb without any scaffolding or gap-filling steps and represents the longest haplotig reported for any species. The assemblies are also more complete and accurate than those reported for most other vertebrates, with 97% of mammalian universal single-copy orthologs present. Conclusions: The high heterozygosity inherent to interspecies crosses maximizes the effectiveness of the trio binning method. The interspecies trio binning approach we describe is likely to provide the highest-quality assemblies for any pair of species that can interbreed to produce hybrid offspring that develop to sufficient cell numbers for DNA extraction. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Animals; Cattle; Chromosomes; Genetic Variation; Genome; Haplotypes; Hybridization, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Annotation; article; autosome; cell count; diploidy; DNA extraction; female; haplotype; heterozygosity; male; nonhuman; orthology; progeny; taurine cattle; yak; animal; bovine; chromosome; genetic variation; genetics; genome; haplotype; hybridization; molecular genetics","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082896312"

A current challenge is to predict transcription factor (TF) regulation from single-cell RNA data. Results: Here, we propose a novel approach for predicting gene expression at the single-cell level using cis-regulatory motifs, as well as epigenetic features. We designed a tree-guided multi-task learning framework that considers each cell as a task. Through this framework we were able to explain the single-cell gene expression values using either TF binding affinities or TF ChIP-seq data measured at specific genomic regions. TFs identified using these models could be validated by the literature. Conclusion: Our proposed method allows us to identify distinct TFs that show cell type–specific regulation. This approach is not limited to TFs but can use any type of data that can potentially be used in explaining gene expression at the single-cell level to study factors that drive differentiation or show abnormal regulation in disease.

While they have been extensively studied, state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction algorithms are often unable to preserve the global structures underlying data. Elastic embedding (EE), a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method, has shown promise in revealing low-dimensional intrinsic local and global data structure. However, the current implementation of the EE algorithm lacks scalability to large-scale scRNA-seq data. Results: We present a distributed optimization implementation of the EE algorithm, termed distributed elastic embedding (D-EE). D-EE reveals the low-dimensional intrinsic structures of data with accuracy equal to that of elastic embedding, and it is scalable to large-scale scRNA-seq data. It leverages distributed storage and distributed computation, achieving memory efficiency and high-performance computing simultaneously. In addition, an extended version of D-EE, termed distributed optimization implementation of time-series elastic embedding (D-TSEE), enables the user to visualize large-scale time-series scRNA-seq data by incorporating experimentally temporal information. Results with large-scale scRNA-seq data indicate that D-TSEE can uncover oscillatory gene expression patterns by using experimentally temporal information. Conclusions: D-EE is a distributed dimensionality reduction and visualization tool. Its distributed storage and distributed computation technique allow us to efficiently analyze large-scale single-cell data at the cost of constant time speedup.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) hence expand on genome-wide association studies by taking multiple genes into account when risk models are built. However, PRS only considers the additive effect of individual genes but not epistatic interactions or the combination of individual and interacting drivers. While evidence of epistatic interactions ais found in small datasets, large datasets have not been processed yet owing to the high computational complexity of the search for epistatic interactions. Findings: We have developed VariantSpark, a distributed machine learning framework able to perform association analysis for complex phenotypes that are polygenic and potentially involve a large number of epistatic interactions. Efficient multi-layer parallelization allows VariantSpark to scale to the whole genome of population-scale datasets with 100,000,000 genomic variants and 100,000 samples. Conclusions: Compared with traditional monogenic genome-wide association studies, VariantSpark better identifies genomic variants associated with complex phenotypes.

Proteogenomic data analysis requires integration of disparate 'omic software tools, as well as customized tools to view and interpret results. The flexible Galaxy platform has proven valuable for proteogenomic data analysis. Here, we describe a novel Multi-omics Visualization Platform (MVP) for organizing, visualizing, and exploring proteogenomic results, adding a critically needed tool for data exploration and interpretation. Findings: MVP is built as an HTML Galaxy plug-in, primarily based on JavaScript. Via the Galaxy API, MVP uses SQLite databases as input - a custom data type (mzSQLite) containing MS-based peptide identification information, a variant annotation table, and a coding sequence table. Users can interactively filter identified peptides based on sequence and data quality metrics, view annotated peptide MS data, and visualize protein-level information, along with genomic coordinates. Peptides that pass the user-defined thresholds can be sent back to Galaxy via the API for further analysis; processed data and visualizations can also be saved and shared. MVP leverages the Integrated Genomics Viewer JavaScript framework, enabling interactive visualization of peptides and corresponding transcript and genomic coding information within the MVP interface. Conclusions: MVP provides a powerful, extensible platform for automated, interactive visualization of proteogenomic results within the Galaxy environment, adding a unique and critically needed tool for empowering exploration and interpretation of results.

However, detection of CNVs with whole-exome sequencing (WES) experiments is challenging. Usually, additional experiments have to be performed. Findings: We developed a novel algorithm for somatic CNV calling in matched WES data called “CopyDetective”. Different from other approaches, CNV calling with CopyDetective consists of a 2-step procedure: first, quality analysis is performed, determining individual detection thresholds for every sample. Second, actual CNV calling on the basis of the previously determined thresholds is performed. Our algorithm evaluates the change in variant allele frequency of polymorphisms and reports the fraction of affected cells for every CNV. Analyzing 4 WES data sets (n = 100) we observed superior performance of CopyDetective compared with ExomeCNV, VarScan2, ControlFREEC, ExomeDepth, and CNV-seq. Conclusions: Individual detection thresholds reveal that not every WES data set is equally apt for CNV calling.

Ideally one should model all covariates in unison, but most existing analysis methods for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) perform only univariate regression. Results: We extend and efficiently implement iterative hard thresholding (IHT) for multiple regression, treating all SNPs simultaneously. Our extensions accommodate generalized linear models, prior information on genetic variants, and grouping of variants. In our simulations, IHT recovers up to 30% more true predictors than SNP-by-SNP association testing and exhibits a 2-3 orders of magnitude decrease in false-positive rates compared with lasso regression. We also test IHT on the UK Biobank hypertension phenotypes and the Northern Finland Birth Cohort of 1966 cardiovascular phenotypes. We find that IHT scales to the large datasets of contemporary human genetics and recovers the plausible genetic variants identified by previous studies. Conclusions: Our real data analysis and simulation studies suggest that IHT can (i) recover highly correlated predictors, (ii) avoid over-fitting, (iii) deliver better true-positive and false-positive rates than either marginal testing or lasso regression, (iv) recover unbiased regression coefficients, (v) exploit prior information and group-sparsity, and (vi) be used with biobank-sized datasets.

In recent years single-molecule sequencing techniques generating long-read information have become available and enabled substantial improvement in contig length and genome completeness, especially for large genomes (>100 Mb), although bioinformatic tools for these applications are still limited. Findings: We developed a software tool to close sequence gaps in genome assemblies, TGS-GapCloser, that uses low-depth (∼10×) long single-molecule reads. The algorithm extracts reads that bridge gap regions between 2 contigs within a scaffold, error corrects only the candidate reads, and assigns the best sequence data to each gap. As a demonstration, we used TGS-GapCloser to improve the scaftig NG50 value of 3 human genome assemblies by 24-fold on average with only ∼10× coverage of Oxford Nanopore or Pacific Biosciences reads, covering with sequence data up to 94.8% gaps with 97.7% positive predictive value. These improved assemblies achieve 99.998% (Q46) single-base accuracy with final inserted sequences having 99.97% (Q35) accuracy, despite the high raw error rate of single-molecule reads, enabling high-quality downstream analyses, including up to a 31-fold increase in the scaftig NGA50 and up to 13.1% more complete BUSCO genes. Additionally, we show that even in ultra-large genome assemblies, such as the ginkgo (∼12 Gb), TGS-GapCloser can cover 71.6% of gaps with sequence data. Conclusions: TGS-GapCloser can close gaps in large genome assemblies using raw long reads quickly and cost-effectively. The final assemblies generated by TGS-GapCloser have improved contiguity and completeness while maintaining high accuracy.

Therefore, the understanding of AR mechanisms, evolution, and global distribution is a priority for patient survival. Despite all efforts in the elucidation of AR mechanisms in clinical strains, little is known about its prevalence and evolution in environmental microorganisms. We used 293 metagenomic samples from the TARA Oceans project to detect and quantify environmental antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) using machine learning tools. Results: After manual curation of ARGs, their abundance and distribution in the global ocean are presented. Additionally, the potential of horizontal ARG transfer by plasmids and their correlation with environmental and geographical parameters is shown. A total of 99,205 environmental open reading frames (ORFs) were classified as 1 of 560 different ARGs conferring resistance to 26 antibiotic classes. We found 24,567 ORFs in putative plasmid sequences, suggesting the importance of mobile genetic elements in the dynamics of environmental ARG transmission. Moreover, 4,804 contigs with >=2 putative ARGs were found, including 2 plasmid-like contigs with 5 different ARGs, highlighting the potential presence of multi-resistant microorganisms in the natural ocean environment. Finally, we identified ARGs conferring resistance to some of the most relevant clinical antibiotics, revealing the presence of 15 ARGs similar to mobilized colistin resistance genes (mcr) with high abundance on polar biomes. Of these, 5 are assigned to Psychrobacter, a genus including opportunistic human pathogens. Conclusions: This study uncovers the diversity and abundance of ARGs in the global ocean metagenome. Our results are available on Zenodo in MySQL database dump format, and all the code used for the analyses, including a Jupyter notebook js avaliable on Github.

In such cases, a cloud-based Galaxy virtual instance represents an alternative that equips the user with complete control over the Galaxy instance itself without the burden of the hardware and software infrastructure involved in running and maintaining a Galaxy server. Results: We present Laniakea, a complete software solution to set up a ""Galaxy on-demand"" platform as a service. Building on the INDIGO-DataCloud software stack, Laniakea can be deployed over common cloud architectures usually supported both by public and private e-infrastructures. The user interacts with a Laniakea-based service through a simple front-end that allows a general setup of a Galaxy instance, and then Laniakea takes care of the automatic deployment of the virtual hardware and the software components. At the end of the process, the user gains access with full administrative privileges to a private, production-grade, fully customisable, Galaxy virtual instance and to the underlying virtual machine (VM). Laniakea features deployment of single-server or cluster-backed Galaxy instances, sharing of reference data across multiple instances, data volume encryption, and support for VM image-based, Docker-based, and Ansible recipe-based Galaxy deployments. A Laniakea-based Galaxy on-demand service, named Laniakea@ReCaS, is currently hosted at the ELIXIR-IT ReCaS cloud facility. Conclusions: Laniakea offers to scientific e-infrastructures a complete and easy-to-use software solution to provide a Galaxy on-demand service to their users. Laniakea-based cloud services will help in making Galaxy more accessible to a broader user base by removing most of the burdens involved in deploying and running a Galaxy service. In turn, this will facilitate the adoption of Galaxy in scenarios where classic public instances do not represent an optimal solution. Finally, the implementation of Laniakea can be easily adapted and expanded to support different services and platforms beyond Galaxy. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Cloud Computing; Computational Biology; Software; User-Computer Interface; Workflow; access to information; Article; client server application; cloud computing; data analysis; data processing; priority journal; privacy; software; standard; virtual reality; workflow; biology; cloud computing; computer interface; workflow","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083072108"

This organism may also be used as a suitable model to explore sex chromosome evolution and reproductive development in terms of differentiation of ZW sex chromosomes, ovoviviparity, and specialization of reproductive organs. However, there is a lack of high-quality genomic data for the female G. affinis; hence, this study aimed to generate a chromosome-level genome assembly for it. Results: The chromosome-level genome assembly was constructed using Oxford nanopore sequencing, BioNano, and Hi-C technology. G. affinis genomic DNA sequences containing 217 contigs with an N50 length of 12.9 Mb and 125 scaffolds with an N50 length of 26.5 Mb were obtained by Oxford nanopore and BioNano, respectively, and the 113 scaffolds (90.4% of scaffolds containing 97.9% nucleotide bases) were assembled into 24 chromosomes (pseudo-chromosomes) by Hi-C. The Z and W chromosomes of G. affinis were identified by comparative genomic analysis of female and male G. affinis, and the mechanism of differentiation of the Z and W chromosomes was explored. Combined with transcriptome data from 6 tissues, a total of 23,997 protein-coding genes were predicted and 23,737 (98.9%) genes were functionally annotated. Conclusions: The high-quality female G. affinis reference genome provides a valuable omics resource for future studies of comparative genomics and functional genomics to explore the evolution of Z and W chromosomes and the reproductive developmental biology of G. affinis.  © The Author(s) 2020.","Animals; Cyprinodontiformes; Female; Genome; Genomics; Male; Phylogeny; Sex Chromosomes; genomic DNA; transcriptome; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; chromosome structure; comparative genomics; controlled study; DNA sequence; female; Gambusia; gene expression; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic code; genome; leukocyte differential count; male; morphology; nanopore sequencing; nonhuman; ovoviviparity; priority journal; protein blood level; sex chromosome; sex difference; animal; Cyprinodontiformes; genetics; genomics; phylogeny; sex chromosome","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089981939"

However, the quality of genome assembly and annotation for several macaque species lags behind the human genome effort. Results: To close this gap and enhance functional genomics approaches, we used a combination of de novo linked-read assembly and scaffolding using proximity ligation assay (HiC) to assemble the pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) genome. This combinatorial method yielded large scaffolds at chromosome level with a scaffold N50 of 127.5 Mb; the 23 largest scaffolds covered 90% of the entire genome. This assembly revealed large-scale rearrangements between pig-tailed macaque chromosomes 7, 12, and 13 and human chromosomes 2, 14, and 15. We subsequently annotated the genome using transcriptome and proteomics data from personalized induced pluripotent stem cells derived from the same animal. Reconstruction of the evolutionary tree using whole-genome annotation and orthologous comparisons among 3 macaque species, human, and mouse genomes revealed extensive homology between human and pig-tailed macaques with regards to both pluripotent stem cell genes and innate immune gene pathways. Our results confirm that rhesus and cynomolgus macaques exhibit a closer evolutionary distance to each other than either species exhibits to humans or pig-tailed macaques. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that pig-tailed macaques can serve as an excellent animal model for the study of many human diseases particularly with regards to pluripotency and innate immune pathways. © The Author(s) 2020.

Existing mNGS data analysis tools typically require bioinformatics expertise and access to local server-class hardware resources. For many research laboratories, this presents an obstacle, especially in resource-limited environments. Findings: We present IDseq, an open source cloud-based metagenomics pipeline and service for global pathogen detection and monitoring (https://idseq.net). The IDseq Portal accepts raw mNGS data, performs host and quality filtration steps, then executes an assembly-based alignment pipeline, which results in the assignment of reads and contigs to taxonomic categories. The taxonomic relative abundances are reported and visualized in an easy-to-use web application to facilitate data interpretation and hypothesis generation. Furthermore, IDseq supports environmental background model generation and automatic internal spike-in control recognition, providing statistics that are critical for data interpretation. IDseq was designed with the specific intent of detecting novel pathogens. Here, we benchmark novel virus detection capability using both synthetically evolved viral sequences and real-world samples, including IDseq analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab sample acquired and processed locally in Cambodia from a tourist from Wuhan, China, infected with the recently emergent SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: The IDseq Portal reduces the barrier to entry for mNGS data analysis and enables bench scientists, clinicians, and bioinformaticians to gain insight from mNGS datasets for both known and novel pathogens. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

DrivAER scores annotated gene sets on the basis of their relevance to user-specified outcomes such as pseudotemporal ordering or disease status. DrivAER iteratively evaluates the information content of each gene set with respect to the outcome variable using autoencoders. We benchmark our method using extensive simulation analysis as well as comparison to existing methods for functional interpretation of scRNA-seq data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DrivAER extracts key pathways and transcription factors that regulate complex biological processes from scRNA-seq data.

Optimization of the imaging set-up and data-processing methods results in high-quality images without artifacts due to mosaicking or due to the use of SIM methods. Reconstruction methods based on Bayesian estimation can be used to produce images with a resolution beyond that dictated by the optical system. Findings: Five complete datasets are presented including large panoramic SIM images of human tissues in pathophysiological conditions. Cancers of the prostate, skin, ovary, and breast, as well as tuberculosis of the lung, were imaged using SIM. The samples are available commercially and are standard histological preparations stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Conclusion: The use of fluorescence microscopy is increasing in histopathology. There is a need for methods that reduce artifacts caused by the use of image-stitching methods or optical sectioning methods such as SIM. Stitched SIM images produce results that may be useful for intraoperative histology.

Because rivers are used extensively for anthropogenic purposes (drinking water, recreation, agriculture, and industry), it is essential to understand how these activities affect the composition of river microbial consortia. Recent studies have shown that river metagenomes vary considerably, suggesting that microbial community data should be included in broad-scale river ecosystem models. But such ecogenomic studies have not been applied on a broad ""aquascape""scale, and few if any have applied the newest nanopore technology. Results: We investigated the metagenomes of 11 rivers across 3 continents using MinION nanopore sequencing, a portable platform that could be useful for future global river monitoring. Up to 10 Gb of data per run were generated with average read lengths of 3.4 kb. Diversity and diagnosis of river function potential was accomplished with 0.5-1.0 ⋅ 106 long reads. Our observations for 7 of the 11 rivers conformed to other river-omic findings, and we exposed previously unrecognized microbial biodiversity in the other 4 rivers. Conclusions: Deeper understanding that emerged is that river microbial consortia and the ecological functions they fulfil did not align with geographic location but instead implicated ecological responses of microbes to urban and other anthropogenic effects, and that changes in taxa manifested over a very short geographic space. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Nevertheless, they can be elucidated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation in combination with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-Seq). CLIP-Seq answers questions about the functional role of an RNA-binding protein and its targets by determining binding sites on a nucleotide level and associated sequence and structural binding patterns. In recent years the amount of CLIP-Seq data skyrocketed, urging the need for an automatic data analysis that can deal with different experimental set-ups. However, noncanonical data, new protocols, and a huge variety of tools, especially for peak calling, made it difficult to define a standard. Findings: CLIP-Explorer is a flexible and reproducible data analysis pipeline for iCLIP data that supports for the first time eCLIP, FLASH, and uvCLAP data. Individual steps like peak calling can be changed to adapt to different experimental settings. We validate CLIP-Explorer on eCLIP data, finding similar or nearly identical motifs for various proteins in comparison with other databases. In addition, we detect new sequence motifs for PTBP1 and U2AF2. Finally, we optimize the peak calling with 3 different peak callers on RBFOX2 data, discuss the difficulty of the peak-calling step, and give advice for different experimental set-ups. Conclusion: CLIP-Explorer finally fills the demand for a flexible CLIP-Seq data analysis pipeline that is applicable to the up-to-date CLIP protocols. The article further shows the limitations of current peak-calling algorithms and the importance of a robust peak detection.  © 2020 The Author(s).

Moreover, GALLO allows the graphical visualization of gene and QTL annotation results, data comparison among different grouping factors (e.g., methods, breeds, tissues, statistical models, studies), and QTL enrichment in different livestock species such as cattle, pigs, sheep, and chickens.

The uptake of 10x Genomics datasets has begun to calm this diversity, and the bioinformatics community leans once more towards the large computing requirements and the statistically driven methods needed to process and understand these ever-growing datasets. Results: Here we outline several Galaxy workflows and learning resources for single-cell RNA-sequencing, with the aim of providing a comprehensive analysis environment paired with a thorough user learning experience that bridges the knowledge gap between the computational methods and the underlying cell biology. The Galaxy reproducible bioinformatics framework provides tools, workflows, and trainings that not only enable users to perform 1-click 10x preprocessing but also empower them to demultiplex raw sequencing from custom tagged and full-length sequencing protocols. The downstream analysis supports a range of high-quality interoperable suites separated into common stages of analysis: Inspection, filtering, normalization, confounder removal, and clustering. The teaching resources cover concepts from computer science to cell biology. Access to all resources is provided at the singlecell.usegalaxy.eu portal. Conclusions: The reproducible and training-oriented Galaxy framework provides a sustainable high-performance computing environment for users to run flexible analyses on both 10x and alternative platforms. The tutorials from the Galaxy Training Network along with the frequent training workshops hosted by the Galaxy community provide a means for users to learn, publish, and teach single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. © The Author(s) 2020.","Computational Biology; Ecosystem; RNA; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Software; RNA; access to information; Article; bioinformatics; computer analysis; cytology; genomics; information dissemination; information processing; RNA sequencing; single cell analysis; software; virtual learning environment; biology; ecosystem; sequence analysis; software","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094222133"

Intersectional genetic approaches can increase the number of genetically accessible cells, but the scope and safety of these approaches have not been systematically assessed. A typical intersectional method acts like an ""AND""logic gate by converting the input of 2 or more active, yet unspecific, regulatory elements (REs) into a single cell type specific synthetic output. Results: Here, we systematically assessed the intersectional genetics landscape of the human genome using a subset of cells from a large RE usage atlas (Functional ANnoTation Of the Mammalian genome 5 consortium, FANTOM5) obtained by cap analysis of gene expression sequencing (CAGE-seq). We developed the heuristics and algorithms to retrieve and quality-rank ""AND""gate intersections. Of the 154 primary cell types surveyed, >90% can be distinguished from each other with as few as 3 to 4 active REs, with quantifiable safety and robustness. We call these minimal intersections of active REs with cell-type diagnostic potential ""versatile entry codes""(VEnCodes). Each of the 158 cancer cell types surveyed could also be distinguished from the healthy primary cell types with small VEnCodes, most of which were robust to intra- and interindividual variation. Methods for the cross-validation of CAGE-seq-derived VEnCodes and for the extraction of VEnCodes from pooled single-cell sequencing data are also presented. Conclusions: Our work provides a systematic view of the intersectional genetics landscape in humans and demonstrates the potential of these approaches for future gene delivery technologies.  © The Author(s) 2020.","Animals; Genome; Humans; algorithm; article; cancer cell; classifier; cross validation; enhancer region; extraction; gene control; gene delivery system; gene expression; heuristics; human; human cell; human genome; major clinical study; mammal; nonhuman; primary cell; promoter region; validation process; animal; genome","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089171422"

Selected groups of microbial features provide signatures that characterize host disease states such as cancer or cardio-metabolic diseases. Yet, the current predictive models stemming from machine learning still behave as black boxes and seldom generalize well. Their interpretation is challenging for physicians and biologists, which makes them difficult to trust and use routinely in the physician-patient decision-making process. Novel methods that provide interpretability and biological insight are needed. Here, we introduce ""predomics"", an original machine learning approach inspired by microbial ecosystem interactions that is tailored for metagenomics data. It discovers accurate predictive signatures and provides unprecedented interpretability. The decision provided by the predictive model is based on a simple, yet powerful score computed by adding, subtracting, or dividing cumulative abundance of microbiome measurements. Results: Tested on >100 datasets, we demonstrate that predomics models are simple and highly interpretable. Even with such simplicity, they are at least as accurate as state-of-the-art methods. The family of best models, discovered during the learning process, offers the ability to distil biological information and to decipher the predictability signatures of the studied condition. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we successfully predicted body corpulence and metabolic improvement after bariatric surgery using pre-surgery microbiome data. Conclusions: Predomics is a new algorithm that helps in providing reliable and trustworthy diagnostic decisions in the microbiome field. Predomics is in accord with societal and legal requirements that plead for an explainable artificial intelligence approach in the medical field. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Models, Genetic; Support Vector Machine; algorithm; Article; bariatric surgery; decision making; human; information processing; learning; machine learning; measurement accuracy; metagenomics; nonhuman; obesity; population abundance; prediction; priority journal; scoring system; support vector machine; biological model; genetics; intestine flora; metagenome; metagenomics; procedures","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081609506"

This can be achieved by phasing the genomic variations. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art haplotype phasing is currently a black box in which the accuracy and quality of the reconstructed haplotypes are hard to assess. Findings: Here we present PhaseME, a versatile method to provide insights into and improvement of sample phasing results based on linkage data. We showcase the performance and the importance of PhaseME by comparing phasing information obtained from Pacific Biosciences including both continuous long reads and high-quality consensus reads, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, 10x Genomics, and Illumina sequencing technologies. We found that 10x Genomics and Oxford Nanopore phasing can be significantly improved while retaining a high N50 and completeness of phase blocks. PhaseME generates reports and summary plots to provide insights into phasing performance and correctness. We observed unique phasing issues for each of the sequencing technologies, highlighting the necessity of quality assessments. PhaseME is able to decrease the Hamming error rate significantly by 22.4% on average across all 5 technologies. Additionally, a significant improvement is obtained in the reduction of long switch errors. Especially for high-quality consensus reads, the improvement is 54.6% in return for only a 5% decrease in phase block N50 length. Conclusions: PhaseME is a universal method to assess the phasing quality and accuracy and improves the quality of phasing using linkage information.

Trio binning offers an innovative solution that exploits heterozygosity for assembly. Short, parental reads are used to assign parental origin to long reads from their F1 offspring before assembly, enabling complete haplotype resolution. Trio binning could therefore provide an effective strategy for assembling highly heterozygous genomes, which are traditionally problematic, such as insect genomes. This includes the wood tiger moth (Arctia plantaginis), which is an evolutionary study system for warning colour polymorphism. Findings: We produced a high-quality, haplotype-resolved assembly for Arctia plantaginis through trio binning. We sequenced a same-species family (F1 heterozygosity ∼1.9%) and used parental Illumina reads to bin 99.98% of offspring Pacific Biosciences reads by parental origin, before assembling each haplotype separately and scaffolding with 10X linked reads. Both assemblies are contiguous (mean scaffold N50: 8.2 Mb) and complete (mean BUSCO completeness: 97.3%), with annotations and 31 chromosomes identified through karyotyping. We used the assembly to analyse genome-wide population structure and relationships between 40 wild resequenced individuals from 5 populations across Europe, revealing the Georgian population as the most genetically differentiated with the lowest genetic diversity. Conclusions: We present the first invertebrate genome to be assembled via trio binning. This assembly is one of the highest quality genomes available for Lepidoptera, supporting trio binning as a potent strategy for assembling heterozygous genomes. Using our assembly, we provide genomic insights into the geographic population structure of A. plantaginis.  © The Author(s) 2020.","Animals; Genome; Genomics; Haplotypes; Humans; Moths; Wood; adult; article; chromosome; clinical article; controlled study; Europe; female; genetic association; genetic variability; Georgian (citizen); haplotype; heterozygosity; human; human experiment; insect genome; karyotyping; Lepidoptera; male; nonhuman; population genomics; population structure; progeny; tiger; animal; genome; genomics; haplotype; moth; wood","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089636108"

Next-generation sequencing has enabled the discovery of ITD at single-nucleotide resolution. ITD allele frequency is used in the risk stratification of patients with AML; higher ITD allele frequency is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. However, the ITD allele frequency data are often unavailable to treating physicians and the detection of ITDs with accurate variant allele frequency (VAF) estimation remains challenging for short-read sequencing. Results: Here we present the ScanITD approach, which performs a stepwise seed-and-realignment procedure for ITD detection with accurate VAF prediction. The evaluations on simulated and real data demonstrate that ScanITD outperforms 3 state-of-the-art ITD detectors, especially for VAF estimation. Importantly, ScanITD yields better accuracy than general-purpose structural variation callers for predicting ITD size range duplications.

Frameshift insertions in protein-coding sequences are extremely rare because they disrupt the reading frame. There are a few known examples of their correction through translational frameshifting, a process that enables ribosomes to skip nucleotides during translation to regain proper reading frame. Corrective frameshifting has been proposed to act on the single base pair insertion at position 174 of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 gene (ND3) that has been observed in several turtles and birds. However, the relatively sparse taxonomic representation has hampered our understanding of the evolution of this insertion in vertebrates. Results: Here, we analyzed 87,707 ND3 sequences from 10,309 vertebrate taxa to reveal the evolutionary history of this insertion and its common genomic characteristics. We confirmed that the insertion only appears in turtles and birds and reconstructed that it evolved independently in both groups with complex patterns of gains and losses. The insertion was observed in almost all bird orders but was absent in all members of the diverse Passeriformes. We found strong conservation in the nucleotides surrounding the insertion in both turtles and birds, which implies that the insertion enforces structural constraints that could be involved in its correction.

Chen (Fabaceae) is an International Union for Conservation of Nature red-listed tree. This tree is of high medicinal and commercial value owing to its officinal, insect-proof, durable heartwood. However, there is a lack of genome reference, which has hindered development of studies on the heartwood formation. Findings: We presented the first chromosome-scale genome assembly of D. odorifera obtained on the basis of Illumina paired-end sequencing, Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time sequencing, 10x Genomics linked reads, and Hi-C technology. We assembled 97.68% of the 653.45 Mb D. odorifera genome with scaffold N50 and contig sizes of 56.16 and 5.92 Mb, respectively. Ten super-scaffolds corresponding to the 10 chromosomes were assembled, with the longest scaffold reaching 79.61 Mb. Repetitive elements account for 54.17% of the genome, and 30,310 protein-coding genes were predicted from the genome, of which ∼92.6% were functionally annotated. The phylogenetic tree showed that D. odorifera diverged from the ancestor of Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus trichocarpa and then separated from Glycine max and Cajanus cajan. Conclusions: We sequence and reveal the first chromosome-level de novo genome of D. odorifera. These studies provide valuable genomic resources for the research of heartwood formation in D. odorifera and other timber trees. The high-quality assembled genome can also be used as reference for comparative genomics analysis and future population genetic studies of D. odorifera.  © The Author(s) 2020.","Chromosomes; Dalbergia; Genome; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Phylogeny; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; Dalbergia odorifera; evolution; gene structure; illumina sequencing; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; pigeonpea; plant chromosome; plant genome; Populus trichocarpa; priority journal; SMRT sequencing; soybean; chromosome; Dalbergia; genetics; genome; molecular genetics; phylogeny","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089647636"

A thorough knowledge of the genetic potential of rumen microbes will provide opportunities for improving the sustainability of ruminant production systems. The availability of gene reference catalogs from gut microbiomes has advanced the understanding of the role of the microbiota in health and disease in humans and other mammals. In this work, we established a catalog of reference prokaryote genes from the bovine rumen. Results: Using deep metagenome sequencing we identified 13,825,880 non-redundant prokaryote genes from the bovine rumen. Compared to human, pig, and mouse gut metagenome catalogs, the rumen is larger and richer in functions and microbial species associated with the degradation of plant cell wall material and production of methane. Genes encoding enzymes catalyzing the breakdown of plant polysaccharides showed a particularly high richness that is otherwise impossible to infer from available genomes or shallow metagenomics sequencing. The catalog expands the dataset of carbohydrate-degrading enzymes described in the rumen. Using an independent dataset from a group of 77 cattle fed 4 common dietary regimes, we found that only <0.1% of genes were shared by all animals, which contrast with a large overlap for functions, i.e., 63% for KEGG functions. Different diets induced differences in the relative abundance rather than the presence or absence of genes, which explains the great adaptability of cattle to rapidly adjust to dietary changes. Conclusions: These data bring new insights into functions, carbohydrate-degrading enzymes, and microbes of the rumen to complement the available information on microbial genomes. The catalog is a significant biological resource enabling deeper understanding of phenotypes and biological processes and will be expanded as new data are made available. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Researchers commonly need to build computational workflows that include multiple analytic tools and require incremental development as experimental insights demand tool and parameter modifications. These workflows can produce hundreds to thousands of intermediate files and results that must be integrated for biological insight. Data-centric workflow systems that internally manage computational resources, software, and conditional execution of analysis steps are reshaping the landscape of biological data analysis and empowering researchers to conduct reproducible analyses at scale. Adoption of these tools can facilitate and expedite robust data analysis, but knowledge of these techniques is still lacking. Here, we provide a series of strategies for leveraging workflow systems with structured project, data, and resource management to streamline large-scale biological analysis.

State-of-the-art imputation techniques, including methods based on singular value decomposition and K-nearest neighbors, can be computationally expensive for large data sets and it is difficult to modify these algorithms to handle certain cases not missing at random. Results: In this work, we use a deep-learning framework based on the variational auto-encoder (VAE) for genomic missing value imputation and demonstrate its effectiveness in transcriptome and methylome data analysis. We show that in the vast majority of our testing scenarios, VAE achieves similar or better performances than the most widely used imputation standards, while having a computational advantage at evaluation time. When dealing with data missing not at random (e.g., few values are missing), we develop simple yet effective methodologies to leverage the prior knowledge about missing data. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of varying latent space regularization strength in VAE on the imputation performances and, in this context, show why VAE has a better imputation capacity compared to a regular deterministic auto-encoder. Conclusions: We describe a deep learning imputation framework for transcriptome and methylome data using a VAE and show that it can be a preferable alternative to traditional methods for data imputation, especially in the setting of large-scale data and certain missing-not-at-random scenarios.  © The Author(s) 2020.","Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Genomics; transcriptome; Article; autoencoder; data analysis; data processing; deep learning; DNA methylation; genomics; human; intermethod comparison; mathematical computing; priority journal; RNA sequencing; variational autoencoder; algorithm; cluster analysis","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089170042"

Recent technological advances allow the easy generation of data with hundreds of millions of single-cell data points with >40 parameters, originating from thousands of individual samples. The analysis of that amount of high-dimensional data becomes demanding in both hardware and software of high-performance computational resources. Current software tools often do not scale to the datasets of such size; users are thus forced to downsample the data to bearable sizes, in turn losing accuracy and ability to detect many underlying complex phenomena. Results: We present GigaSOM.jl, a fast and scalable implementation of clustering and dimensionality reduction for flow and mass cytometry data. The implementation of GigaSOM.jl in the high-level and high-performance programming language Julia makes it accessible to the scientific community and allows for efficient handling and processing of datasets with billions of data points using distributed computing infrastructures. We describe the design of GigaSOM.jl, measure its performance and horizontal scaling capability, and showcase the functionality on a large dataset from a recent study. Conclusions: GigaSOM.jl facilitates the use of commonly available high-performance computing resources to process the largest available datasets within minutes, while producing results of the same quality as the current state-of-art software. Measurements indicate that the performance scales to much larger datasets.

However, there exist few computational models that aggregate various bioentities to comprehensively reveal the physical and functional landscape of biological systems. Results: We constructed a molecular association network, which contains 18 edges (relationships) between 8 nodes (bioentities). Based on this, we propose Bioentity2vec, a new method for representing bioentities, which integrates information about the attributes and behaviors of a bioentity. Applying the random forest classifier, we achieved promising performance on 18 relationships, with an area under the curve of 0.9608 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.9572. Conclusions: Our study shows that constructing a network with rich topological and biological information is important for systematic understanding of the biological landscape at the molecular level. Our results show that Bioentity2vec can effectively represent biological entities and provides easily distinguishable information about classification tasks. Our method is also able to simultaneously predict relationships between single types and multiple types, which will accelerate progress in biological experimental research and industrial product development. © The Author(s) 2020.

Genome-wide discovery approaches are needed to fully elucidate their roles in health and disease, but resolving tandem repeat variation accurately remains a challenging task. While traditional mapping-based approaches using short-read data have severe limitations in the size and type of tandem repeats they can resolve, recent third-generation sequencing technologies exhibit substantially higher sequencing error rates, which complicates repeat resolution. Results: We developed TRiCoLOR, a freely available tool for tandem repeat profiling using error-prone long reads from third-generation sequencing technologies. The method can identify repetitive regions in sequencing data without a prior knowledge of their motifs or locations and resolve repeat multiplicity and period size in a haplotype-specific manner. The tool includes methods to interactively visualize the identified repeats and to trace their Mendelian consistency in pedigrees. Conclusions: TRiCoLOR demonstrates excellent performance and improved sensitivity and specificity compared with alternative tools on synthetic data. For real human whole-genome sequencing data, TRiCoLOR achieves high validation rates, suggesting its suitability to identify tandem repeat variation in personal genomes. © The Author(s) 2020.

For instance, deleterious or pathogenic variants are overwhelmed by the sea of neutral variants in the non-coding regions of the genome: thus, the prediction of deleterious variants is a challenging, highly imbalanced classification problem, and classical prediction tools fail to detect the rare pathogenic examples among the huge amount of neutral variants or undergo severe restrictions in managing big genomic data. Results: To overcome these limitations we propose parSMURF, a method that adopts a hyper-ensemble approach and oversampling and undersampling techniques to deal with imbalanced data, and parallel computational techniques to both manage big genomic data and substantially speed up the computation. The synergy between Bayesian optimization techniques and the parallel nature of parSMURF enables efficient and user-friendly automatic tuning of the hyper-parameters of the algorithm, and allows specific learning problems in genomic medicine to be easily fit. Moreover, by using MPI parallel and machine learning ensemble techniques, parSMURF can manage big data by partitioning them across the nodes of a high-performance computing cluster. Results with synthetic data and with single-nucleotide variants associated with Mendelian diseases and with genome-wide association study hits in the non-coding regions of the human genome, involhing millions of examples, show that parSMURF achieves state-of-the-art results and an 80-fold speed-up with respect to the sequential version. Conclusions: parSMURF is a parallel machine learning tool that can be trained to learn different genomic problems, and its multiple levels of parallelization and high scalability allow us to efficiently fit problems characterized by big and imbalanced genomic data.

In this study, we investigate in depth how the parameter space of 10x library preparation and sequencing affects assembly quality, on the basis of both simulated and real libraries. RESULTS: We prepared and sequenced eight 10x libraries with a diverse set of parameters from standard cell lines NA12878 and NA24385 and performed whole-genome assembly on the data. We also developed the simulator LRTK-SIM to follow the workflow of 10x data generation and produce realistic simulated Linked-Read data sets. We found that assembly quality could be improved by increasing the total sequencing coverage (C) and keeping physical coverage of DNA fragments (CF) or read coverage per fragment (CR) within broad ranges. The optimal physical coverage was between 332× and 823× and assembly quality worsened if it increased to >1,000× for a given C. Long DNA fragments could significantly extend phase blocks but decreased contig contiguity. The optimal length-weighted fragment length (W${\mu _{FL}}$) was ∼50-150 kb. When broadly optimal parameters were used for library preparation and sequencing, ∼80% of the genome was assembled in a diploid state. CONCLUSIONS: The Linked-Read libraries we generated and the parameter space we identified provide theoretical considerations and practical guidelines for personal genome assemblies based on 10x Linked-Read sequencing. © The Author(s) 2019.

This method has also been used frequently in scaffolding nucleotide sequences obtained by de novo genome sequencing and assembly, in which the number of resultant sequences rarely converges to the chromosome number. Despite its prevalent use, the sample preparation methods for Hi-C have not been intensively discussed, especially from the standpoint of genome scaffolding. Results: To gain insight into the best practice of Hi-C scaffolding, we performed a multifaceted methodological comparison using vertebrate samples and optimized various factors during sample preparation, sequencing, and computation. As a result, we identified several key factors that helped improve Hi-C scaffolding, including the choice and preparation of tissues, library preparation conditions, the choice of restriction enzyme(s), and the choice of scaffolding program and its usage. Conclusions: This study provides the first comparison of multiple sample preparation kits/protocols and computational programs for Hi-C scaffolding by an academic third party.

Specifically, drought is one of the major abiotic stresses that affect and limit Tibetan barley growth. Osmotic stress is often simultaneously accompanied by drought conditions. Thus, to improve crop yield, it is critical to explore the molecular mechanism governing the responses of hull-less barley to osmotic/drought stress conditions. Findings: In this study, we used quantitative proteomics by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry to investigate protein abundance changes in tolerant (XL) and sensitive (DQ) cultivars. A total of 6,921 proteins were identified and quantified in all samples. Two distinct strategies based on pairwise and time-course comparisons were utilized in the comprehensive analysis of differentially abundant proteins. Further functional analysis of differentially abundant proteins revealed that some hormone metabolism-associated and phytohormone abscisic acid-induced genes are primarily affected by osmotic stress. Enhanced regulation of reactive oxygen species (may promote the tolerance of hull-less barley under osmotic stress. Moreover, we found that some regulators, such as GRF, PR10, MAPK, and AMPK, were centrally positioned in the gene regulatory network, suggesting that they may have a dominant role in the osmotic stress response of Tibetan barley.

To translate this resulting state into a causal relationship with a subset of regulatory features, many experiments deploy an array of laboratory assays from multiple modalities. Often, each of these resulting datasets is large, heterogeneous, and noisy. Thus, it is non-trivial to unify these complex datasets into an interpretable phenotype. Although recent methods address this problem with varying degrees of success, they are constrained by their scopes or limitations. Therefore, an important gap in the field is the lack of a universal data harmonizer with the capability to arbitrarily integrate multi-modal datasets. Results: In this review, we perform a critical analysis of methods with the explicit aim of harmonizing data, as opposed to case-specific integration. This revealed that matrix factorization, latent variable analysis, and deep learning are potent strategies. Finally, we describe the properties of an ideal universal data harmonization framework. Conclusions: A sufficiently advanced universal harmonizer has major medical implications, such as (i) identifying dysregulated biological pathways responsible for a disease is a powerful diagnostic tool; (2) investigating these pathways further allows the biological community to better understand a disease’s mechanisms; and (3) precision medicine also benefits from developments in this area, particularly in the context of the growing field of selective epigenome editing, which can suppress or induce a desired phenotype. © The Author(s) 2020.","Computational Biology; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenomics; Gene Expression Regulation; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Machine Learning; Software; bioinformatics; data integration; data science; deep learning; epigenetics; gene activity; gene control; gene editing; human; machine learning; personalized medicine; phenotype; priority journal; Review; biology; epigenetics; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; high throughput sequencing; procedures; software","Oxford University Press","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086624029"

The sample selected for sequencing is a double haploid derived from the same ""Bartlett"" reference pear that was previously sequenced. Sequencing of di-haploid plants makes assembly more tractable in highly heterozygous species such as P. communis. Findings: A total of 496.9 Mb corresponding to 97% of the estimated genome size were assembled into 494 scaffolds. Hi-C data and a high-density genetic map allowed us to anchor and orient 87% of the sequence on the 17 pear chromosomes. Approximately 50% (247 Mb) of the genome consists of repetitive sequences. Gene annotation confirmed the presence of 37,445 protein-coding genes, which is 13% fewer than previously predicted. Conclusions: We showed that the use of a doubled-haploid plant is an effective solution to the problems presented by high levels of heterozygosity and duplication for the generation of high-quality genome assemblies.

While many studies have exploited public resources such as RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data in The Cancer Genome Atlas to study lncRNAs in cancer, it is crucial to choose the optimal method for accurate expression quantification. Results: In this study, we compared the performance of pseudoalignment methods Kallisto and Salmon, alignment-based transcript quantification method RSEM, and alignment-based gene quantification methods HTSeq and featureCounts, in combination with read aligners STAR, Subread, and HISAT2, in lncRNA quantification, by applying them to both un-stranded and stranded RNA-Seq datasets. Full transcriptome annotation, including protein-coding and non-coding RNAs, greatly improves the specificity of lncRNA expression quantification. Pseudoalignment methods and RSEM outperform HTSeq and featureCounts for lncRNA quantification at both sample-and gene-level comparison, regardless of RNA-Seq protocol type, choice of aligners, and transcriptome annotation. Pseudoalignment methods and RSEM detect more lncRNAs and correlate highly with simulated ground truth. On the contrary, HTSeq and featureCounts often underestimate lncRNA expression. Antisense lncRNAs are poorly quantified by alignment-based gene quantification methods, which can be improved using stranded protocols and pseudoalignment methods. Conclusions: Considering the consistency with ground truth and computational resources, pseudoalignment methods Kallisto or Salmon in combination with full transcriptome annotation is our recommended strategy for RNA-Seq analysis for lncRNAs. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The Chinese tapertail, or Japanese grenadier anchovy, Coilia nasus, is a valuable migratory fish of high economic importance and special migratory dimorphism (with certain individuals as non-migratory residents). Results: In this study, an 870.0-Mb high-quality genome was assembled by the combination of Illumina and Pacific Biosciences sequencing. Approximately 812.1 Mb of scaffolds were linked to 24 chromosomes using a high-density genetic map from a family of 104 full siblings and their parents. In addition, population sequencing of 96 representative individuals from diverse areas along the putative migration path identified 150 candidate genes, which are mainly enriched in 3 Ca2+-related pathways. Based on integrative genomic and transcriptomic analyses, we determined that the 3 Ca2+-related pathways are critical for promotion of migratory adaption. A large number of molecular markers were also identified, which distinguished migratory individuals and non-migratory freshwater residents. Conclusions: We assembled a chromosome-level genome for the Chinese tapertail anchovy. The genome provided a valuable genetic resource for understanding of migratory adaption and population genetics and will benefit the aquaculture and management of this economically important fish. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

However, most studies focus on model systems and do not enforce FAIR data management principles. Here we study the H3K27me3 epigenome and associated transcriptome of Brassica rapa, an important vegetable cultivated worldwide. Findings: We performed H3K27me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing and transcriptomic analysis by 3′-end RNA sequencing from B. rapa leaves and inflorescences. To analyze these data we developed a Reproducible Epigenomic Analysis pipeline using Galaxy and Jupyter, packaged into Docker images to facilitate transparency and reuse. We found that H3K27me3 covers roughly one-third of all B. rapa protein-coding genes and its presence correlates with low transcript levels. The comparative analysis between leaves and inflorescences suggested that the expression of various floral regulatory genes during development depends on H3K27me3. To demonstrate the importance of H3K27me3 for B. rapa development, we characterized a mutant line deficient in the H3K27 methyltransferase activity. We found that braA.clf mutant plants presented pleiotropic alterations, e.g., curly leaves due to increased expression and reduced H3K27me3 levels at AGAMOUS-like loci. Conclusions: We characterized the epigenetic mark H3K27me3 at genome-wide levels and provide genetic evidence for its relevance in B. rapa development. Our work reveals the epigenomic landscape of H3K27me3 in B. rapa and provides novel genomics datasets and bioinformatics analytical resources.

Assigning reliable taxon labels to genomes is key and often a prerequisite for downstream analyses. Findings: We introduce CAMITAX, a scalable and reproducible workflow for the taxonomic labelling of microbial genomes recovered from isolates, single cells, and metagenomes. CAMITAX combines genome distance-, 16S ribosomal RNA gene-, and gene homology-based taxonomic assignments with phylogenetic placement. It uses Nextflow to orchestrate reference databases and software containers and thus combines ease of installation and use with computational reproducibility. We evaluated the method on several hundred metagenome-assembled genomes with high-quality taxonomic annotations from the TARA Oceans project, and we show that the ensemble classification method in CAMITAX improved on all individual methods across tested ranks.

Consequently, a large variety of tools have been developed to perform homology classification across genomes of different species. However, when applied to large genomic data sets, these tools require high memory and CPU usage, typically available only in computational clusters. Findings: Here we present a new graph-based orthology analysis tool, SwiftOrtho, which is optimized for speed and memory usage when applied to large-scale data. SwiftOrtho uses long k-mers to speed up homology search, while using a reduced amino acid alphabet and spaced seeds to compensate for the loss of sensitivity due to long k-mers. In addition, it uses an affinity propagation algorithm to reduce the memory usage when clustering large-scale orthology relationships into orthologous groups. In our tests, SwiftOrtho was the only tool that completed orthology analysis of proteins from 1,760 bacterial genomes on a computer with only 4 GB RAM. Using various standard orthology data sets, we also show that SwiftOrtho has a high accuracy.

The elusiveness of the species makes it difficult to study. Thus, having a genome assembled for this deep-sea-dwelling species will allow several pending evolutionary questions to be unlocked. Findings: We present a draft genome assembly that includes 200 Gb of Illumina reads, 4 Gb of Moleculo synthetic long reads, and 108 Gb of Chicago libraries, with a final size matching the estimated genome size of 2.7 Gb, and a scaffold N50 of 4.8 Mb. We also present an alternative assembly including 27 Gb raw reads generated using the Pacific Biosciences platform. In addition, we sequenced the proteome of the same individual and RNA from 3 different tissue types from 3 other species of squid (Onychoteuthis banksii, Dosidicus gigas, and Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis) to assist genome annotation. We annotated 33,406 protein-coding genes supported by evidence, and the genome completeness estimated by BUSCO reached 92%. Repetitive regions cover 49.17% of the genome. Conclusions: This annotated draft genome of A. dux provides a critical resource to investigate the unique traits of this species, including its gigantism and key adaptations to deep-sea environments. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

For many diseases, such as neurological disorders, this stratification problem translates into a complex problem of clustering multivariate and relatively short time series because (i) these diseases are multifactorial and not well described by single clinical outcome variables and (ii) disease progression needs to be monitored over time. Additionally, clinical data often additionally are hindered by the presence of many missing values, further complicating any clustering attempts. FINDINGS: The problem of clustering multivariate short time series with many missing values is generally not well addressed in the literature. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based method to address this issue, variational deep embedding with recurrence (VaDER). VaDER relies on a Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder framework, which is further extended to (i) model multivariate time series and (ii) directly deal with missing values. We validated VaDER by accurately recovering clusters from simulated and benchmark data with known ground truth clustering, while varying the degree of missingness. We then used VaDER to successfully stratify patients with Alzheimer disease and patients with Parkinson disease into subgroups characterized by clinically divergent disease progression profiles. Additional analyses demonstrated that these clinical differences reflected known underlying aspects of Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. CONCLUSIONS: We believe our results show that VaDER can be of great value for future efforts in patient stratification, and multivariate time-series clustering in general. © The Author(s) 2019.

GDPR's accountability principle requires institutions, projects, and data hubs to document their data processings and demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. In response to this requirement, we see the emergence of commercial data-mapping tools, and institutions creating GDPR data register with such tools. One shortcoming of this approach is the genericity of tools, and their process-based model not capturing the project-based, collaborative nature of data processing in biomedical research. Findings: We have developed a software tool to allow research institutions to comply with the GDPR accountability requirement and map the sometimes very complex data flows in biomedical research. By analysing the transparency and record-keeping obligations of each GDPR principle, we observe that our tool effectively meets the accountability requirement. Conclusions: The GDPR is bringing data protection to center stage in research data management, necessitating dedicated tools, personnel, and processes. Our tool, DAISY, is tailored specifically for biomedical research and can help institutions in tackling the documentation challenge brought about by the GDPR. DAISY is made available as a free and open source tool on Github.

However, looking at specific genes requires bespoke coding for which wet-lab biologists or clinicians are not trained. This leads to high demands on bioinformaticians, who may lack insight into the specific biological problem. To bridge this gap, we developed a tool for mapping and quantification of methylation differences at candidate genomic features of interest, without using coding. Findings: We generated the workflow ""CandiMeth"" (Candidate Methylation) in the web-based environment Galaxy. CandiMeth takes as input any table listing differences in methylation generated by either ChAMP or RnBeads and maps these to the human genome. A simple interface then allows the user to query the data using lists of gene names. CandiMeth generates (i) tracks in the popular UCSC Genome Browser with an intuitive visual indicator of where differences in methylation occur between samples or groups of samples and (ii) tables containing quantitative data on the candidate regions, allowing interpretation of significance. In addition to genes and promoters, CandiMeth can analyse methylation differences at long and short interspersed nuclear elements. Cross-comparison to other open-resource genomic data at UCSC facilitates interpretation of the biological significance of the data and the design of wet-lab assays to further explore methylation changes and their consequences for the candidate genes.

This bottleneck limits advancements in understanding plant genomes and the development of improved, high-yielding crop varieties. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate the application of deep learning on proximal imaging from a mobile field vehicle to directly estimate plant morphology and developmental stages in wheat under field conditions. We developed and trained a convolutional neural network with image datasets labeled from expert visual scores and used this ""breeder-trained"" network to classify wheat morphology and developmental stages. For both morphological (awned) and phenological (flowering time) traits, we demonstrate high heritability and very high accuracy against the ""ground-truth"" values from visual scoring. Using the traits predicted by the network, we tested genotype-to-phenotype association using the deep learning phenotypes and uncovered novel epistatic interactions for flowering time. Enabled by the time-series high-throughput phenotyping, we describe a new phenotype as the rate of flowering and show heritable genetic control for this trait. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a field-based high-throughput phenotyping approach using deep learning that can directly measure morphological and developmental phenotypes in genetic populations from field-based imaging. The deep learning approach presented here gives a conceptual advancement in high-throughput plant phenotyping because it can potentially estimate any trait in any plant species for which the combination of breeder scores and high-resolution images can be obtained, capturing the expert knowledge from breeders, geneticists, pathologists, and physiologists to train the networks. © The Author(s) 2019.

However, efficient feature extraction and quantification from image data remains a bottleneck that needs to be addressed. Advances in sensor technology have led to the increasing use of imaging to monitor and measure a range of plants including the model Arabidopsis thaliana. These extensive datasets contain diverse trait information, but feature extraction is often still implemented using approaches requiring substantial manual input. Results: The computational detection and segmentation of individual fruits from images is a challenging task, for which we have developed DeepPod, a patch-based 2-phase deep learning framework. The associated manual annotation task is simple and cost-effective without the need for detailed segmentation or bounding boxes. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used for classifying different parts of the plant inflorescence, including the tip, base, and body of the siliques and the stem inflorescence. In a post-processing step, different parts of the same silique are joined together for silique detection and localization, whilst taking into account possible overlapping among the siliques. The proposed framework is further validated on a separate test dataset of 2,408 images. Comparisons of the CNN-based prediction with manual counting (R2 = 0.90) showed the desired capability of methods for estimating silique number. Conclusions: The DeepPod framework provides a rapid and accurate estimate of fruit number in a model system widely used by biologists to investigate many fundemental processes underlying growth and reproduction. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Arabidopsis; Deep Learning; Fruit; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Software; Arabidopsis; article; biologist; convolutional neural network; deep learning; feature extraction; fruit; image analysis; inflorescence; nonhuman; phenotype; plant stem; plant yield; prediction; reproduction; silique; Arabidopsis; biological model; fruit; genetics; growth, development and aging; quantitative trait; software; biologist; human; reproduction","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081043193"

Segmentation and feature extraction of plant roots from images presents a significant computer vision challenge. Root images contain complicated structures, variations in size, background, occlusion, clutter and variation in lighting conditions. We present a new image analysis approach that provides fully automatic extraction of complex root system architectures from a range of plant species in varied imaging set-ups. Driven by modern deep-learning approaches, RootNav 2.0 replaces previously manual and semi-automatic feature extraction with an extremely deep multi-task convolutional neural network architecture. The network also locates seeds, first order and second order root tips to drive a search algorithm seeking optimal paths throughout the image, extracting accurate architectures without user interaction. Results: We develop and train a novel deep network architecture to explicitly combine local pixel information with global scene information in order to accurately segment small root features across high-resolution images. The proposed method was evaluated on images of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from a seedling assay. Compared with semi-automatic analysis via the original RootNav tool, the proposed method demonstrated comparable accuracy, with a 10-fold increase in speed. The network was able to adapt to different plant species via transfer learning, offering similar accuracy when transferred to an Arabidopsis thaliana plate assay. A final instance of transfer learning, to images of Brassica napus from a hydroponic assay, still demonstrated good accuracy despite many fewer training images. Conclusions: We present RootNav 2.0, a new approach to root image analysis driven by a deep neural network. The tool can be adapted to new image domains with a reduced number of images, and offers substantial speed improvements over semi-automatic and manual approaches. The tool outputs root architectures in the widely accepted RSML standard, for which numerous analysis packages exist (http://rootsystemml.github.io/), as well as segmentation masks compatible with other automated measurement tools. The tool will provide researchers with the ability to analyse root systems at larget scales than ever before, at a time when large scale genomic studies have made this more important than ever. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Computationally driven data-intensive experiments using workflows enable automation, scaling, adaptation, and provenance support. However, there are still several challenges associated with the effective sharing, publication, and reproducibility of such workflows due to the incomplete capture of provenance and lack of interoperability between different technical (software) platforms. Results: Based on best-practice recommendations identified from the literature on workflow design, sharing, and publishing, we define a hierarchical provenance framework to achieve uniformity in provenance and support comprehensive and fully re-executable workflows equipped with domain-specific information. To realize this framework, we present CWLProv, a standard-based format to represent any workflow-based computational analysis to produce workflow output artefacts that satisfy the various levels of provenance. We use open source community-driven standards, interoperable workflow definitions in Common Workflow Language (CWL), structured provenance representation using the W3C PROV model, and resource aggregation and sharing as workflow-centric research objects generated along with the final outputs of a given workflow enactment. We demonstrate the utility of this approach through a practical implementation of CWLProv and evaluation using real-life genomic workflows developed by independent groups. Conclusions: The underlying principles of the standards utilized by CWLProv enable semantically rich and executable research objects that capture computational workflows with retrospective provenance such that any platform supporting CWL will be able to understand the analysis, reuse the methods for partial reruns, or reproduce the analysis to validate the published findings. © 2019 The Author(s).","Genomics; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Software; Workflow; Article; bioinformatics; clinical practice; data interoperability; data processing; health care utilization; human; implementation science; metadata; priority journal; standardization; workflow; genomics; software; theoretical model","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074416835"

The MinION device can sequence native DNA and RNA in real time, providing an opportunity to compare the utility of DNA and RNA for prediction of antibiotic susceptibility. However, the effectiveness of bacterial direct RNA sequencing and base-calling has not previously been investigated. This study interrogated the genome and transcriptome of 4 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) K. pneumoniae clinical isolates; however, further antimicrobial susceptibility testing identified 3 isolates as pandrug-resistant (PDR). Results: The majority of acquired resistance (≥75%) resided on plasmids including several megaplasmids (≥100 kb). DNA sequencing detected most resistance genes (≥70%) within 2 hours of sequencing. Neural network-based base-calling of direct RNA achieved up to 86% identity rate, although ≤23% of reads could be aligned. Direct RNA sequencing (with ∼6 times slower pore translocation) was able to identify (within 10 hours) ≥35% of resistance genes, including those associated with resistance to aminoglycosides, β-lactams, trimethoprim, and sulphonamide and also quinolones, rifampicin, fosfomycin, and phenicol in some isolates. Direct RNA sequencing also identified the presence of operons containing up to 3 resistance genes. Polymyxin-resistant isolates showed a heightened transcription of phoPQ (≥2-fold) and the pmrHFIJKLM operon (≥8-fold). Expression levels estimated from direct RNA sequencing displayed strong correlation (Pearson: 0.86) compared to quantitative real-time PCR across 11 resistance genes. Conclusion: Overall, MinION sequencing rapidly detected the XDR/PDR K. pneumoniae resistome, and direct RNA sequencing provided accurate estimation of expression levels of these genes. © The Author(s) 2020.

These analyses often incorporate gene network properties to account for differential contributions of each gene. We extend this concept further-defining gene contributions based on biophysical properties-by leveraging mathematical models of biology to predict the effects of genetic perturbations on a particular downstream function. Results: We present a method that combines gene weights from model predictions and gene ranks from genome-wide association studies into a weighted gene-set test. We demonstrate in simulation how such a method can improve statistical power. To this effect, we identify a gene set, weighted by model-predicted contributions to intracellular calcium ion concentration, that is significantly related to bipolar disorder in a small dataset (P = 0.04; n = 544). We reproduce this finding using publicly available summary data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (P = 1.7 × 10−4; n = 41,653). By contrast, an approach using a general calcium signaling pathway did not detect a significant association with bipolar disorder (P = 0.08). The weighted gene-set approach based on intracellular calcium ion concentration did not detect a significant relationship with schizophrenia (P = 0.09; n = 65,967) or major depression disorder (P = 0.30; n = 500,199). Conclusions: Together, these findings show how incorporating math biology into gene-set analyses might help to identify biological functions that underlie certain polygenic disorders. © The Author(s) 2020.

They offer biological context in which to integrate, analyze, and interpret omic measurements, but their large scale and extensive connectivity present unique challenges. While it is practical to simplify these networks by placing constraints on compartments and hubs, it is unclear how these simplifications alter the structure of metabolic networks and the interpretation of metabolomic experiments. Results: We curated and adapted the latest systemic model of human metabolism and developed customizable tools to define metabolic networks with and without compartmentalization in subcellular organelles and with or without inclusion of prolific metabolite hubs. Compartmentalization made networks larger, less dense, and more modular, whereas hubs made networks larger, more dense, and less modular. When present, these hubs also dominated shortest paths in the network, yet their exclusion exposed the subtler prominence of other metabolites that are typically more relevant to metabolomic experiments. We applied the non-compartmental network without metabolite hubs in a retrospective, exploratory analysis of metabolomic measurements from 5 studies on human tissues. Network clusters identified individual reactions that might experience differential regulation between experimental conditions, several of which were not apparent in the original publications. Conclusions: Exclusion of specific metabolite hubs exposes modularity in both compartmental and non-compartmental metabolic networks, improving detection of relevant clusters in omic measurements. Better computational detection of metabolic network clusters in large data sets has potential to identify differential regulation of individual genes, transcripts, and proteins. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Kalanchoë fedtschenkoi is an obligate CAM model featuring a relatively small genome and easy stable transformation. However, the molecular responses to light quality and intensity in CAM plants remain understudied. Results: Here we present a genome-wide expression atlas of K. fedtschenkoi plants grown under 12 h/12 h photoperiod with different light quality (blue, red, far-red, white light) and intensity (0, 150, 440, and 1,000 μmol m-2 s-1) based on RNA sequencing performed for mature leaf samples collected at dawn (2 h before the light period) and dusk (2 h before the dark period). An eFP web browser was created for easy access of the gene expression data. Based on the expression atlas, we constructed a light-responsive co-expression network to reveal the potential regulatory relationships in K. fedtschenkoi. Measurements of leaf titratable acidity, soluble sugar, and starch turnover provided metabolic indicators of the magnitude of CAM under the different light treatments and were used to provide biological context for the expression dataset. Furthermore, CAM-related subnetworks were highlighted to showcase genes relevant to CAM pathway, circadian clock, and stomatal movement. In comparison with white light, monochrome blue/red/far-red light treatments repressed the expression of several CAM-related genes at dusk, along with a major reduction in acid accumulation. Increasing light intensity from an intermediate level (440 μmol m-2 s-1) of white light to a high light treatment (1,000 μmol m-2 s-1) increased expression of several genes involved in dark CO2 fixation and malate transport at dawn, along with an increase in organic acid accumulation. Conclusions: This study provides a useful genomics resource for investigating the molecular mechanism underlying the light regulation of physiology and metabolism in CAM plants. Our results support the hypothesis that both light intensity and light quality can modulate the CAM pathway through regulation of CAM-related genes in K. fedtschenkoi. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Crassulacean Acid Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Kalanchoe; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Sunlight; Transcriptome; carboxylic acid; starch; sugar; plant protein; transcriptome; acidity; Article; carbon dioxide fixation; circadian rhythm; comparative study; Crassulacean acid metabolism plant; gene expression; genetic association; genome-wide association study; Kalanchoe; Kalanchoe fedtschenkoi; light exposure; light intensity; light quality; nonhuman; photoperiodicity; photosynthesis; phototherapy; plant growth; plant leaf; plant physiology; plant stoma; priority journal; RNA sequencing; web browser; white light; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; radiation response; sunlight","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081529269"

Owing to its voracious appetite, wide environmental adaptability, high growth rate, and reproductive capacity, it has become an invasive species across the world, mainly in Southeast Asia, Japan, the western Pacific islands, and China. This pest can damage agricultural crops and is an intermediate host of many parasites that can threaten human health. However, genomic information of A. fulica remains limited, hindering genetic and genomic studies for invasion control and management of the species. Findings: Using a k-mer-based method, we estimated the A. fulica genome size to be 2.12 Gb, with a high repeat content up to 71%. Roughly 101.6 Gb genomic long-read data of A. fulica were generated from the Pacific Biosciences sequencing platform and assembled to produce a first A. fulica genome of 1.85 Gb with a contig N50 length of 726 kb. Using contact information from the Hi-C sequencing data, we successfully anchored 99.32% contig sequences into 31 chromosomes, leading to the final contig and scaffold N50 length of 721 kb and 59.6 Mb, respectively. The continuity, completeness, and accuracy were evaluated by genome comparison with other mollusk genomes, BUSCO assessment, and genomic read mapping. A total of 23,726 protein-coding genes were predicted from the assembled genome, among which 96.34% of the genes were functionally annotated. The phylogenetic analysis using whole-genome protein-coding genes revealed that A. fulica separated from a common ancestor with Biomphalaria glabrata ∼182 million years ago. Conclusion: To our knowledge, the A. fulica genome is the first terrestrial mollusk genome published to date. The chromosome sequence of A. fulica will provide the research community with a valuable resource for population genetics and environmental adaptation studies for the species, as well as investigations of the chromosome-level of evolution within mollusks. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

However, the communication between users and BCI systems through artificial matching is a critical issue. Recently, BCIs have been developed to adopt intuitive decoding, which is the key to solving several problems such as a small number of classes and manually matching BCI commands with device control. Unfortunately, the advances in this area have been slow owing to the lack of large and uniform datasets. This study provides a large intuitive dataset for 11 different upper extremity movement tasks obtained during multiple recording sessions. The dataset includes 60-channel electroencephalography, 7-channel electromyography, and 4-channel electro-oculography of 25 healthy participants collected over 3-day sessions for a total of 82,500 trials across all the participants. Findings: We validated our dataset via neurophysiological analysis. We observed clear sensorimotor de-/activation and spatial distribution related to real-movement and motor imagery, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated the consistency of the dataset by evaluating the classification performance of each session using a baseline machine learning method. Conclusions: The dataset includes the data of multiple recording sessions, various classes within the single upper extremity, and multimodal signals. This work can be used to (i) compare the brain activities associated with real movement and imagination, (ii) improve the decoding performance, and (iii) analyze the differences among recording sessions. Hence, this study, as a Data Note, has focused on collecting data required for further advances in the BCI technology. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

As domestic geese breeds derive from both the swan goose (Anser cygnoides) and the graylag goose (Anser anser), we selected a female Tianfu goose for genome sequencing. We generated a chromosome-level goose genome assembly by adopting a hybrid de novo assembly approach that combined Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time sequencing, high-throughput chromatin conformation capture mapping, and Illumina short-read sequencing. Findings: We generated a 1.11-Gb goose genome with contig and scaffold N50 values of 1.85 and 33.12 Mb, respectively. The assembly contains 39 pseudo-chromosomes (2n = 78) accounting for ∼88.36% of the goose genome. Compared with previous goose assemblies, our assembly has more continuity, completeness, and accuracy; the annotation of core eukaryotic genes and universal single-copy orthologs has also been improved. We have identified 17,568 protein-coding genes and a repeat content of 8.67% (96.57 Mb) in this genome assembly. We also explored the spatial organization of chromatin and gene expression in the goose liver tissues, in terms of inter-pseudo-chromosomal interaction patterns, compartments, topologically associating domains, and promoter-enhancer interactions. Conclusions: We present the first chromosome-level assembly of the goose genome. This will be a valuable resource for future genetic and genomic studies on geese. © The Author(s) 2020.

However, most previous performance evaluations of SNP calling have been restricted to eukaryotic (human) data. Additionally, bacterial SNP calling requires choosing an appropriate reference genome to align reads to, which, together with the bioinformatic pipeline, affects the accuracy and completeness of a set of SNP calls obtained. This study evaluates the performance of 209 SNP-calling pipelines using a combination of simulated data from 254 strains of 10 clinically common bacteria and real data from environmentally sourced and genomically diverse isolates within the genera Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, and Klebsiella. Results: We evaluated the performance of 209 SNP-calling pipelines, aligning reads to genomes of the same or a divergent strain. Irrespective of pipeline, a principal determinant of reliable SNP calling was reference genome selection. Across multiple taxa, there was a strong inverse relationship between pipeline sensitivity and precision, and the Mash distance (a proxy for average nucleotide divergence) between reads and reference genome. The effect was especially pronounced for diverse, recombinogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli but less dominant for clonal species such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Conclusions: The accuracy of SNP calling for a given species is compromised by increasing intra-species diversity. When reads were aligned to the same genome from which they were sequenced, among the highest-performing pipelines was Novoalign/GATK. By contrast, when reads were aligned to particularly divergent genomes, the highest-performing pipelines often used the aligners NextGenMap or SMALT, and/or the variant callers LoFreq, mpileup, or Strelka. © The Author(s) 2020.

Although the ELIXIR Core Data Resources and other established infrastructures provide comprehensive and long-term stable services and platforms for FAIR data management, a large quantity of research data is still hidden or at risk of getting lost. Currently, high-throughput plant genomics and phenomics technologies are producing research data in abundance, the storage of which is not covered by established core databases. This concerns the data volume, e.g., time series of images or high-resolution hyper-spectral data; the quality of data formatting and annotation, e.g., with regard to structure and annotation specifications of core databases; uncovered data domains; or organizational constraints prohibiting primary data storage outside institional boundaries. Results: To share these potentially dark data in a FAIR way and master these challenges the ELIXIR Germany/de.NBI service Plant Genomic and Phenomics Research Data Repository (PGP) implements a “bring the infrastructure to the data” approach, which allows research data to be kept in place and wrapped in a FAIR-aware software infrastructure. This article presents new features of the e!DAL infrastructure software and the PGP repository as a best practice on how to easily set up FAIR-compliant and intuitive research data services. Furthermore, the integration of the ELIXIR Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure (AAI) and data discovery services are introduced as means to lower technical barriers and to increase the visibility of research data. Conclusion: The e!DAL software matured to a powerful and FAIR-compliant infrastructure, while keeping the focus on flexible setup and integration into existing infrastructures and into the daily research process. © The Author(s) 2020.

However, there are few studies examining the relative abundance of microbial communities at the species level along the human respiratory tract. Findings: Bronchoalveolar lavage, throat swab, mouth rinse, and nasal swab samples were collected from 5 participants. Bacterial ribosomal operons were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION to determine the relative abundance of bacterial species in 4 compartments along the respiratory tract. More than 1.8 million raw operon reads were obtained from the participants with ∼600,000 rRNA reads passing quality assurance/quality control (70-95% identify; >1,200 bp alignment) by Discontiguous MegaBLAST against the EZ BioCloud 16S rRNA gene database. Nearly 3,600 bacterial species were detected overall (>750 bacterial species within the 5 dominant phyla: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria. The relative abundance of bacterial species along the respiratory tract indicated that most microbes (95%) were being passively transported from outside into the lung. However, a small percentage (<5%) of bacterial species were at higher abundance within the lavage samples. The most abundant lung-enriched bacterial species were Veillonella dispar and Veillonella atypica while the most abundant mouth-associated bacterial species were Streptococcus infantis and Streptococcus mitis. Conclusions: Most bacteria detected in lower respiratory samples do not seem to colonize the lung. However, >100 bacterial species were found to be enriched in bronchoalveolar lavage samples (compared to mouth/nose) and may play a substantial role in lung health. © The Author(s) 2020.

Its wing color consists of both pigmentary colored scales (black, reddish) and structural colored scales (iridescent blue or green dust). A high-quality reference genome of P. bianor is an important foundation for investigating iridescent color evolution, phylogeography, and the evolution of swallowtail butterflies. Findings: We obtained a chromosome-level de novo genome assembly of the highly heterozygous P. bianor using long Pacific Biosciences sequencing reads and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture technology. The final assembly is 421.52 Mb on 30 chromosomes (29 autosomes and 1 Z sex chromosome) with 13.12 Mb scaffold N50. In total, 15,375 protein-coding genes and 233.09 Mb of repetitive sequences were identified. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that P. bianor separated from a common ancestor of swallowtails ∼23.69-36.04 million years ago. Demographic history suggested that the population expansion of this species from the last interglacial period to the last glacial maximum possibly resulted from its decreased natural enemies and its adaptation to climate change during the glacial period.

To ensure the wide usability of the produced data beyond an individual project, rich and systematic annotation of the underlying experiments is crucial. Findings: We first developed an annotation structure that captures the overall experimental design as well as the relevant details of the steps from the biological sample to the library preparation, the sequencing procedure, and the sequencing and processed files. Through various design features, such as controlled vocabularies and different field requirements, we ensured a high annotation quality, comparability, and ease of annotation. The structure can be easily adapted to a large variety of species. We then implemented the annotation strategy in a user-hosted web platform with data import, query, and export functionality.

The draft reference genome (Sscrofa10.2) of a purebred Duroc female pig established using older clone-based sequencing methods was incomplete, and unresolved redundancies, short-range order and orientation errors, and associated misassembled genes limited its utility. Results: We present 2 annotated highly contiguous chromosome-level genome assemblies created with more recent long-read technologies and a whole-genome shotgun strategy, 1 for the same Duroc female (Sscrofa11.1) and 1 for an outbred, composite-breed male (USMARCv1.0). Both assemblies are of substantially higher (>90-fold) continuity and accuracy than Sscrofa10.2. Conclusions: These highly contiguous assemblies plus annotation of a further 11 short-read assemblies provide an unprecedented view of the genetic make-up of this important agricultural and biomedical model species. We propose that the improved Duroc assembly (Sscrofa11.1) become the reference genome for genomic research in pigs. © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.

The secretion of wax, and other unusual features of scale insects, is thought to be an adaptation to their change from an ancestral ground-dwelling lifestyle to a sedentary lifestyle on the higher parts of plants. As well as helping to improve its economic value, studies of E. pela might also help to explain the adaptation of scale insects. However, no genomic data are currently available for E. pela. Findings: To assemble the E. pela genome, 303.92 Gb of data were generated using Illumina and Pacific Biosciences sequencing, producing 277.22 Gb of clean data for assembly. The assembled genome size was 0.66 Gb, with 1,979 scaffolds and a scaffold N50 of 735 kb. The guanine + cytosine content was 33.80%. A total of 12,022 protein-coding genes were predicted, with a mean coding sequence length of 1,370 bp. Twenty-six fatty acyl-CoA reductase genes and 35 acyltransferase genes were identified. Evolutionary analysis revealed that E. pela and aphids formed a sister group and split ∼241.1 million years ago. There were 214 expanded gene families and 2,219 contracted gene families in E. pela. Conclusion: We present the first genome sequence from the Coccidae family. These results will help to increase our understanding of the evolution of unique features in scale insects, and provide important genetic information for further research. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Phylogenetic analyses indicate that D. oleifera is closely related to Diospyros kaki Thunb. and could be used as a model plant for studies of D. kaki. Therefore, development of genomic resources of D. oleifera will facilitate auxiliary assembly of the hexaploid persimmon genome and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of important traits. Findings: The D. oleifera genome was assembled with 443.6 Gb of raw reads using the Pacific Bioscience Sequel and Illumina HiSeq X Ten platforms. The final draft genome was ∼812.3 Mb and had a high level of continuity with N50 of 3.36 Mb. Fifteen scaffolds corresponding to the 15 chromosomes were assembled to a final size of 721.5 Mb using 332 scaffolds, accounting for 88.81% of the genome. Repeat sequences accounted for 54.8% of the genome. By de novo sequencing and analysis of homology with other plant species, 30,530 protein-coding genes with an average transcript size of 7,105.40 bp were annotated; of these, 28,580 protein-coding genes (93.61%) had conserved functional motifs or terms. In addition, 171 candidate genes involved in tannin synthesis and deastringency in persimmon were identified; of these chalcone synthase (CHS) genes were expanded in the D. oleifera genome compared with Diospyros lotus, Camellia sinensis, and Vitis vinifera. Moreover, 186 positively selected genes were identified, including chalcone isomerase (CHI) gene, a key enzyme in the flavonoid-anthocyanin pathway. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that the split of D. oleifera and D. lotus likely occurred 9.0 million years ago. In addition to the ancient γevent, a second whole-genome duplication event occurred in D. oleifera and D. lotus. Conclusions: We generated a high-quality chromosome-level draft genome for D. oleifera, which will facilitate assembly of the hexaploid persimmon genome and further studies of major economic traits in the genus Diospyros. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

While often convincing in terms of predictive performance, the underlying models are in general not straightforward to interpret, the interplay between the actual genetic determinant and its translation as k-mers being generally hard to decipher. Results: We propose a simple and computationally efficient strategy allowing one to cope with the high correlation inherent to k-mer-based representations in supervised machine learning models, leading to concise and easily interpretable signatures. We demonstrate the benefit of this approach on the task of predicting the antibiotic resistance profile of a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain from its genome, where our method leads to signatures defined as weighted linear combinations of genetic elements that can easily be identified as genuine antibiotic resistance determinants, with state-of-the-art predictive performance. Conclusions: By enhancing the interpretability of genomic k-mer-based antibiotic resistance prediction models, our approach improves their clinical utility and hence will facilitate their adoption in routine diagnostics by clinicians and microbiologists. While antibiotic resistance was the motivating application, the method is generic and can be transposed to any other bacterial trait.

However, despite SCC4 plants having features that are valuable in engineering higher photosynthetic efficiencies in agriculturally important C3 species such as rice, there are no reported sequenced SCC4 plant genomes, limiting our understanding of the mechanisms involved in, and evolution of, SCC4 photosynthesis. Findings: Using Illumina and Pacific Biosciences sequencing platforms, we generated ∼202 Gb of clean genomic DNA sequences having a 433-fold coverage based on the 467 Mb estimated genome size of S. aralocaspica. The final genome assembly was 452 Mb, consisting of 4,033 scaffolds, with a scaffold N50 length of 1.83 Mb. We annotated 29,604 protein-coding genes using Evidence Modeler based on the gene information from ab initio predictions, homology levels with known genes, and RNA sequencing-based transcriptome evidence. We also annotated noncoding genes, including 1,651 long noncoding RNAs, 21 microRNAs, 382 transfer RNAs, 88 small nuclear RNAs, and 325 ribosomal RNAs.

Findings: Draft de novo reference genome assemblies were generated using a combination of long and short sequencing reads. For each species, the PromethION platform was used to generate 30-45× sequence coverage, and the Illumina platform was used to generate 50-160× sequence coverage. Illumina-only assemblies were fragmented with high numbers of contigs, while ONT-only assemblies were error prone with low BUSCO scores. The highest N50 values, ranging from 0.4 to 2.7 Mb, were from assemblies generated using a combination of short- and long-read data. BUSCO scores were consistently >90% complete using the Eukaryota database. Conclusions: High-quality genomes can be obtained from a combination of using short-read Illumina data to polish assemblies generated with long-read ONT data.

This has led to an explosive growth in sequencing data produced worldwide. As the amount of data increases, so does the need for automated solutions for data processing and analysis. The concept of workflows has gained favour in the bioinformatics community, but there is little in the scientific literature describing end-to-end automation systems. Arteria is an automation system that aims at providing a solution to the data-related operational challenges that face sequencing core facilities. Findings: Arteria is built on existing open source technologies, with a modular design allowing for a community-driven effort to create plug-and-play micro-services. In this article we describe the system, elaborate on the underlying conceptual framework, and present an example implementation. Arteria can be reduced to 3 conceptual levels: orchestration (using an event-based model of automation), process (the steps involved in processing sequencing data, modelled as workflows), and execution (using a series of RESTful micro-services). This creates a system that is both flexible and scalable. Arteria-based systems have been successfully deployed at 3 sequencing core facilities. The Arteria Project code, written largely in Python, is available as open source software, and more information can be found at https://arteria-project.github.io/. Conclusions: We describe the Arteria system and the underlying conceptual framework, demonstrating how this model can be used to automate data handling and analysis in the context of a sequencing core facility. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

A classical toxicogenomic study consists in testing the effects of a compound at different dose levels and different time points. The main challenge consists in identifying the gene alteration patterns that are correlated to doses and time points. The majority of existing methods for toxicogenomics data analysis allow the study of the molecular alteration after the exposure (or treatment) at each time point individually. However, this kind of analysis cannot identify dynamic (time-dependent) events of dose responsiveness. Results: We propose TinderMIX, an approach that simultaneously models the effects of time and dose on the transcriptome to investigate the course of molecular alterations exerted in response to the exposure. Starting from gene log fold-change, TinderMIX fits different integrated time and dose models to each gene, selects the optimal one, and computes its time and dose effect map; then a user-selected threshold is applied to identify the responsive area on each map and verify whether the gene shows a dynamic (time-dependent) and dose-dependent response; eventually, responsive genes are labelled according to the integrated time and dose point of departure. Conclusions: To showcase the TinderMIX method, we analysed 2 drugs from the Open TG-GATEs dataset, namely, cyclosporin A and thioacetamide.We first identified the dynamic dose-dependent mechanism of action of each drug and compared them. Our analysis highlights that different time- and dose-integrated point of departure recapitulates the toxicity potential of the compounds as well as their dynamic dose-dependent mechanism of action. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

The ploidy, hybridity, and size of the genome, estimated to have >10 Gb, pose a challenge for sequencing. Results: Here we present a gene space assembly of SP80-3280, including 373,869 putative genes and their potential regulatory regions. The alignment of single-copy genes in diploid grasses to the putative genes indicates that we could resolve 2-6 (up to 15) putative homo(eo)logs that are 99.1% identical within their coding sequences. Dissimilarities increase in their regulatory regions, and gene promoter analysis shows differences in regulatory elements within gene families that are expressed in a species-specific manner. We exemplify these differences for sucrose synthase (SuSy) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 2 gene families central to carbon partitioning. SP80-3280 has particular regulatory elements involved in sucrose synthesis not found in the ancestor Saccharum spontaneum. PAL regulatory elements are found in co-expressed genes related to fiber synthesis within gene networks defined during plant growth and maturation. Comparison with sorghum reveals predominantly bi-allelic variations in sugarcane, consistent with the formation of 2 ""subgenomes"" after their divergence ∼3.8-4.6 million years ago and reveals single-nucleotide variants that may underlie their differences. Conclusions: This assembly represents a large step towards a whole-genome assembly of a commercial sugarcane cultivar. It includes a rich diversity of genes and homo(eo)logous resolution for a representative fraction of the gene space, relevant to improve biomass and food production. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

However, the ability to differentiate between cell groups could be affected by clustering. This interdependency often creates a bottleneck in the analysis pipeline, requiring researchers to repeat these 2 steps multiple times by setting different clustering parameters to identify a set of cell groups that are more differentiated and biologically relevant. Findings: To accelerate this process, we have developed IKAP-An algorithm to identify major cell groups and improve differentiating cell groups by systematically tuning parameters for clustering. We demonstrate that, with default parameters, IKAP successfully identifies major cell types such as T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and monocytes in 2 peripheral blood mononuclear cell datasets and recovers major cell types in a previously published mouse cortex dataset. These major cell groups identified by IKAP present more distinguishing DE genes compared with cell groups generated by different combinations of clustering parameters. We further show that cell subtypes can be identified by recursively applying IKAP within identified major cell types, thereby delineating cell identities in a multi-layered ontology. Conclusions: By tuning the clustering parameters to identify major cell groups, IKAP greatly improves the automation of single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis to produce distinguishing DE genes and refine cell ontology using single-cell RNA-sequencing data. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Yet, on the cell population level, a subset of genes traditionally referred to as housekeeping genes (HKGs) are found to be stably expressed in different cell and tissue types. It is therefore critical to question whether stably expressed genes (SEGs) can be identified on the single-cell level, and if so, how can their expression stability be assessed? We have previously proposed a computational framework for ranking expression stability of genes in single cells for scRNA-seq data normalization and integration. In this study, we perform detailed evaluation and characterization of SEGs derived from this framework. Results: Here, we show that gene expression stability indices derived from the early human and mouse development scRNA-seq datasets and the ""Mouse Atlas"" dataset are reproducible and conserved across species. We demonstrate that SEGs identified from single cells based on their stability indices are considerably more stable than HKGs defined previously from cell populations across diverse biological systems. Our analyses indicate that SEGs are inherently more stable at the single-cell level and their characteristics reminiscent of HKGs, suggesting their potential role in sustaining essential functions in individual cells. Conclusions: SEGs identified in this study have immediate utility both for understanding variation and stability of single-cell transcriptomes and for practical applications such as scRNA-seq data normalization. Our framework for calculating gene stability index, ""scSEGIndex,"" is incorporated into the scMerge Bioconductor R package (https://sydneybiox.github.io/scMerge/reference/scSEGIndex.html) and can be used for identifying genes with stable expression in scRNA-seq datasets. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Results: This study applied X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT) to acquire 3D structures of the corollas of clade Corytholoma and extracted a set of 415 3D landmarks from each specimen. By applying the geometric morphometrics (GM) to the landmarks, the first 4 principal components (PCs) in the 3D shape and 3D form analyses, respectively, accounted for 87.86% and 96.34% of the total variance. The centroid sizes of the corollas only accounted for 5.46% of the corolla shape variation, suggesting that the evolutionary allometry was weak. The 4 morphological traits corresponding to the 4 shape PCs were defined as tube curvature, lobe area, tube dilation, and lobe recurvation. Tube curvature and tube dilation were strongly associated with the pollination type and contained phylogenetic signals in clade Corytholoma. The landmarks were further used to reconstruct corolla shapes at the ancestral states.

Repetitive sequences can be co-opted into a variety of functions and thus provide a source for evolutionary novelty. However, comprehensively detecting ancestral repeats that align between species is difficult because considering all repeat-overlapping seeds in alignment methods that rely on the seed-and-extend heuristic results in prohibitively high runtimes. RESULTS: Here, we show that ignoring repeat-overlapping alignment seeds when aligning entire genomes misses numerous alignments between repetitive elements. We present a tool, RepeatFiller, that improves genome alignments by incorporating previously undetected local alignments between repetitive sequences. By applying RepeatFiller to genome alignments between human and 20 other representative mammals, we uncover between 22 and 84 Mb of previously undetected alignments that mostly overlap transposable elements. We further show that the increased alignment coverage improves the annotation of conserved non-exonic elements, both by discovering numerous novel transposon-derived elements that evolve under constraint and by removing thousands of elements that are not under constraint in placental mammals. CONCLUSIONS: RepeatFiller contributes to comprehensively aligning repetitive genomic regions, which facilitates studying transposon co-option and genome evolution.

To address this challenge, workflow management systems, such as Watchdog, have been developed to support scientists in the (semi-)automated execution of large analysis workflows. Implementation: Here, we present Watchdog 2.0, which implements new developments for module creation, reusability, and documentation and for reproducibility of analyses and workflow execution. Developments include a graphical user interface for semi-automatic module creation from software help pages, sharing repositories for modules and workflows, and a standardized module documentation format. The latter allows generation of a customized reference book of public and user-specific modules. Furthermore, extensive logging of workflow execution, module and software versions, and explicit support for package managers and container virtualization now ensures reproducibility of results. A step-by-step analysis protocol generated from the log file may, e.g., serve as a draft of a manuscript methods section. Finally, 2 new execution modes were implemented. One allows resuming workflow execution after interruption or modification without rerunning successfully executed tasks not affected by changes. The second one allows detaching and reattaching to workflow execution on a local computer while tasks continue running on computer clusters. Conclusions: Watchdog 2.0 provides several new developments that we believe to be of benefit for large-scale bioinformatics analysis and that are not completely covered by other competing workflow management systems.

The jellyfish Rhopilema esculentum is an important fishery resource in China. However, the genome resource of R. esculentum has not been reported to date. Findings: In this study, we constructed a chromosome-level genome assembly of R. esculentum using Pacific Biosciences, Illumina, and Hi-C sequencing technologies. The final genome assembly was ∼275.42 Mb, with a contig N50 length of 1.13 Mb. Using Hi-C technology to identify the contacts among contigs, 260.17 Mb (94.46%) of the assembled genome were anchored onto 21 pseudochromosomes with a scaffold N50 of 12.97 Mb. We identified 17,219 protein-coding genes, with an average CDS length of 1,575 bp. The genome-wide phylogenetic analysis indicated that R. esculentum might have evolved more slowly than the other scyphozoan species used in this study. In addition, 127 toxin-like genes were identified, and 1 toxin-related “hub” was found by a genomic survey. Conclusions: We have generated a chromosome-level genome assembly of R. esculentum that could provide a valuable genomic background for studying the biology and pharmacology of jellyfish, as well as the evolutionary history of Cnidaria. © The Author(s) 2020.

With the rapid increase in newly sequenced archaeal and bacterial genomes, manual identification of CRISPR-Cas systems is no longer viable. Thus, an automated approach is required for advancing our understanding of the evolution and diversity of these systems and for finding new candidates for genome engineering in eukaryotic models. Results: We introduce CRISPRcasIdentifier, a new machine learning-based tool that combines regression and classification models for the prediction of potentially missing proteins in instances of CRISPR-Cas systems and the prediction of their respective subtypes. In contrast to other available tools, CRISPRcasIdentifier can both detect cas genes and extract potential association rules that reveal functional modules for CRISPR-Cas systems. In our experimental benchmark on the most recently published and comprehensive CRISPR-Cas system dataset, CRISPRcasIdentifier was compared with recent and state-of-the-art tools. According to the experimental results, CRISPRcasIdentifier presented the best Cas protein identification and subtype classification performance. Conclusions: Overall, our tool greatly extends the classification of CRISPR cassettes and, for the first time, predicts missing Cas proteins and association rules between Cas proteins. Additionally, we investigated the properties of CRISPR subtypes. The proposed tool relies not only on the knowledge of manual CRISPR annotation but also on models trained using machine learning.  © The Author(s) 2020.","Algorithms; Archaea; Bacteria; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Computational Biology; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Genome, Archaeal; Genome, Bacterial; Genomics; Machine Learning; Workflow; article; CRISPR Cas system; machine learning; prediction; protein analysis; algorithm; archaeal genome; archaeon; bacterial genome; bacterium; biology; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; genetics; genomics; machine learning; procedures; workflow","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086700524"

One of the most popular and convenient representations of genetic information is the allele frequency spectrum (AFS), the distribution of allele frequencies in populations. The joint AFS is commonly used to reconstruct the demographic history of multiple populations, and several methods based on diffusion approximation (e.g., ai) and ordinary differential equations (e.g., moments) have been developed and applied for demographic inference. These methods provide an opportunity to simulate AFS under a variety of researcher-specified demographic models and to estimate the best model and associated parameters using likelihood-based local optimizations. However, there are no known algorithms to perform global searches of demographic models with a given AFS. Results: Here, we introduce a new method that implements a global search using a genetic algorithm for the automatic and unsupervised inference of demographic history from joint AFS data. Our method is implemented in the software GADMA (Genetic Algorithm for Demographic Model Analysis, https://github.com/ctlab/GADMA). Conclusions: We demonstrate the performance of GADMA by applying it to sequence data from humans and non-model organisms and show that it is able to automatically infer a demographic model close to or even better than the one that was previously obtained manually. Moreover, GADMA is able to infer multiple demographic models at different local optima close to the global one, providing a larger set of possible scenarios to further explore demographic history. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Algorithms; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Frequency; Humans; Models, Genetic; Population; Software; article; demography; gene frequency; genetic algorithm; genomics; human; population genetics; software; algorithm; biological model; genetics; molecular evolution; population; software","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081069554"

Spreng is one of the important plant resources involved in the production of agarwood in China. The agarwood resin collected from wounded Aquilaria trees has been used in Asia for aromatic or medicinal purposes from ancient times, although the mechanism underlying the formation of agarwood still remains poorly understood owing to a lack of accurate and high-quality genetic information. Findings: We report the genomic architecture of A. sinensis by using an integrated strategy combining Nanopore, Illumina, and Hi-C sequencing. The final genome was ∼726.5 Mb in size, which reached a high level of continuity and a contig N50 of 1.1 Mb. We combined Hi-C data with the genome assembly to generate chromosome-level scaffolds. Eight super-scaffolds corresponding to the 8 chromosomes were assembled to a final size of 716.6 Mb, with a scaffold N50 of 88.78 Mb using 1,862 contigs. BUSCO evaluation reveals that the genome completeness reached 95.27%. The repeat sequences accounted for 59.13%, and 29,203 protein-coding genes were annotated in the genome. According to phylogenetic analysis using single-copy orthologous genes, we found that A. sinensis is closely related to Gossypium hirsutum and Theobroma cacao from the Malvales order, and A. sinensis diverged from their common ancestor ∼53.18-84.37 million years ago. Conclusions: Here, we present the first chromosome-level genome assembly and gene annotation of A. sinensis.

As a result, long-read sequencing platforms are becoming more popular. In this respect, the Oxford Nanopore Technologies-based long-read sequencing “nanopore” platform is becoming a widely used tool with a broad range of applications and end-users. However, the need to explore and manipulate the complex data generated by long-read sequencing platforms necessitates accompanying specialized bioinformatics platforms and tools to process the long-read data correctly. Importantly, such tools should additionally help democratize bioinformatics analysis by enabling easy access and ease-of-use solutions for researchers. Results: The Galaxy platform provides a user-friendly interface to computational command line-based tools, handles the software dependencies, and provides refined workflows. The users do not have to possess programming experience or extended computer skills. The interface enables researchers to perform powerful bioinformatics analysis, including the assembly and analysis of short- or long-read sequence data. The newly developed “NanoGalaxy” is a Galaxy-based toolkit for analysing long-read sequencing data, which is suitable for diverse applications, including de novo genome assembly from genomic, metagenomic, and plasmid sequence reads. Conclusions: A range of best-practice tools and workflows for long-read sequence genome assembly has been integrated into a NanoGalaxy platform to facilitate easy access and use of bioinformatics tools for researchers.

Long-read sequencing technologies may be used to generate more complete and contiguous genome assemblies than alternate technologies; however, long-read methods have historically had greater input DNA requirements and higher costs than next-generation sequencing, which are barriers to their use on many samples. Here, we present a 2.3 Gb de novo genome assembly of a field-collected adult female spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) using a single Pacific Biosciences SMRT Cell. The spotted lanternfly is an invasive species recently discovered in the northeastern United States that threatens to damage economically important crop plants in the region. Results: The DNA from 1 individual was used to make 1 standard, size-selected library with an average DNA fragment size of ∼20 kb. The library was run on 1 Sequel II SMRT Cell 8M, generating a total of 132 Gb of long-read sequences, of which 82 Gb were from unique library molecules, representing ∼36× coverage of the genome. The assembly had high contiguity (contig N50 length = 1.5 Mb), completeness, and sequence level accuracy as estimated by conserved gene set analysis (96.8% of conserved genes both complete and without frame shift errors). Furthermore, it was possible to segregate more than half of the diploid genome into the 2 separate haplotypes. The assembly also recovered 2 microbial symbiont genomes known to be associated with L. delicatula, each microbial genome being assembled into a single contig. Conclusions: We demonstrate that field-collected arthropods can be used for the rapid generation of high-quality genome assemblies, an attractive approach for projects on emerging invasive species, disease vectors, or conservation efforts of endangered species. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

It is thought to have been domesticated in Africa from its wild relative, Solanum anguivi. S. aethiopicum has been routinely used as a source of disease resistance genes for several Solanaceae crops, including Solanum melongena. A lack of genomic resources has meant that breeding of S. aethiopicum has lagged behind other vegetable crops. Results: We assembled a 1.02-Gb draft genome of S. aethiopicum, which contained predominantly repetitive sequences (78.9%). We annotated 37,681 gene models, including 34,906 protein-coding genes. Expansion of disease resistance genes was observed via 2 rounds of amplification of long terminal repeat retrotransposons, which may have occurred ∼1.25 and 3.5 million years ago, respectively. By resequencing 65 S. aethiopicum and S. anguivi genotypes, 18,614,838 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified, of which 34,171 were located within disease resistance genes. Analysis of domestication and demographic history revealed active selection for genes involved in drought tolerance in both ""Gilo"" and ""Shum"" groups. A pan-genome of S. aethiopicum was assembled, containing 51,351 protein-coding genes; 7,069 of these genes were missing from the reference genome. Conclusions: The genome sequence of S. aethiopicum enhances our understanding of its biotic and abiotic resistance. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified are immediately available for use by breeders. The information provided here will accelerate selection and breeding of the African eggplant, as well as other crops within the Solanaceae family. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

High-performance computational facilities are capable of processing considerable volumes of data, yet often lack an easy-to-use interface to guide the user in supervising and adjusting bioinformatics analysis via a tablet or smartphone. Results: To address this gap we proposed Telescope, a novel tool that interfaces with high-performance computational clusters to deliver an intuitive user interface for controlling and monitoring bioinformatics analyses in real-time. By leveraging last generation technology now ubiquitous to most researchers (such as smartphones), Telescope delivers a friendly user experience and manages conectivity and encryption under the hood. Conclusions: Telescope helps to mitigate the digital divide between wet and computational laboratories in contemporary biology.

With the increase in treatment options, risk-adapted therapy is becoming more and more important. Survival analysis is commonly applied to study progression or other events of interest and stratify the risk of patients. Results: In this study, we present the current state-of-the-art model for MM prognosis and the molecular biomarker set for stratification: the winning algorithm in the 2017 Multiple Myeloma DREAM Challenge, Sub-Challenge 3. Specifically, we built a non-parametric complete hazard ranking model to map the right-censored data into a linear space, where commonplace machine learning techniques, such as Gaussian process regression and random forests, can play their roles. Our model integrated both the gene expression profile and clinical features to predict the progression of MM. Compared with conventional models, such as Cox model and random survival forests, our model achieved higher accuracy in 3 within-cohort predictions. In addition, it showed robust predictive power in cross-cohort validations. Key molecular signatures related to MM progression were identified from our model, which may function as the core determinants of MM progression and provide important guidance for future research and clinical practice. Functional enrichment analysis and mammalian gene-gene interaction network revealed crucial biological processes and pathways involved in MM progression. The model is dockerized and publicly available at https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11459638. Both data and reproducible code are included in the docker. Conclusions: We present the current state-of-the-art prognostic model for MM integrating gene expression and clinical features validated in an independent test set. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

They share a volant common ancestor with Procellariiformes close to the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (66 million years ago) and subsequently lost the ability to fly but enhanced their diving capabilities. With ∼20 species among 6 genera, penguins range from the tropical Galápagos Islands to the oceanic temperate forests of New Zealand, the rocky coastlines of the sub-Antarctic islands, and the sea ice around Antarctica. To inhabit such diverse and extreme environments, penguins evolved many physiological and morphological adaptations. However, they are also highly sensitive to climate change. Therefore, penguins provide an exciting target system for understanding the evolutionary processes of speciation, adaptation, and demography. Genomic data are an emerging resource for addressing questions about such processes. Results: Here we present a novel dataset of 19 high-coverage genomes that, together with 2 previously published genomes, encompass all extant penguin species. We also present a well-supported phylogeny to clarify the relationships among penguins. In contrast to recent studies, our results demonstrate that the genus Aptenodytes is basal and sister to all other extant penguin genera, providing intriguing new insights into the adaptation of penguins to Antarctica. As such, our dataset provides a novel resource for understanding the evolutionary history of penguins as a clade, as well as the fine-scale relationships of individual penguin lineages. Against this background, we introduce a major consortium of international scientists dedicated to studying these genomes. Moreover, we highlight emerging issues regarding ensuring legal and respectful indigenous consultation, particularly for genomic data originating from New Zealand Taonga species. Conclusions: We believe that our dataset and project will be important for understanding evolution, increasing cultural heritage and guiding the conservation of this iconic southern hemisphere species assemblage. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

However, little research has been conducted on J. sigillata at the molecular level, which hinders understanding of its evolution, speciation, and synthesis of secondary metabolites, as well as its wide adaptability to its plateau environment. To address these issues, a high-quality reference genome of J. sigillata would be useful. Findings: To construct a high-quality reference genome for J. sigillata, we first generated 38.0 Gb short reads and 66.31 Gb long reads using Illumina and Nanopore sequencing platforms, respectively. The sequencing data were assembled into a 536.50-Mb genome assembly with a contig N50 length of 4.31 Mb. Additionally, we applied BioNano technology to identify contacts among contigs, which were then used to assemble contigs into scaffolds, resulting in a genome assembly with scaffold N50 length of 16.43 Mb and contig N50 length of 4.34 Mb. To obtain a chromosome-level genome assembly, we constructed 1 Hi-C library and sequenced 79.97 Gb raw reads using the Illumina HiSeq platform. We anchored ∼93% of the scaffold sequences into 16 chromosomes and evaluated the quality of our assembly using the high contact frequency heat map. Repetitive elements account for 50.06% of the genome, and 30,387 protein-coding genes were predicted from the genome, of which 99.8% have been functionally annotated. The genome-wide phylogenetic tree indicated an estimated divergence time between J. sigillata and Juglans regia of 49 million years ago on the basis of single-copy orthologous genes. Conclusions: We provide the first chromosome-level genome for J. sigillata. It will lay a valuable foundation for future research on the genetic improvement of J. sigillata. © The Author(s) 2020.

However, studies on chromatin architecture in perennial woody plants and on the function of chromatin organization in sex determination have not been reported. Results: Here, we produced a chromosome-scale de novo genome assembly of the woody plant Jatropha curcas with a total length of 379.5 Mb and a scaffold N50 of 30.7 Mb using Pacific Biosciences long reads combined with genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technology. Based on this high-quality reference genome, we detected chromatin architecture differences between monoecious and gynoecious inflorescence buds of Jatropha. Differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in the changed A/B compartments and topologically associated domain regions and occurred preferentially in differential contact regions between monoecious and gynoecious inflorescence buds. Twelve differentially expressed genes related to flower development or hormone synthesis displayed significantly different genomic interaction patterns in monoecious and gynoecious inflorescence buds. These results demonstrate that chromatin organization participates in the regulation of gene transcription during the process of sex differentiation in Jatropha. Conclusions: We have revealed the features of chromatin architecture in perennial woody plants and investigated the possible function of chromatin organization in Jatropha sex differentiation. These findings will facilitate understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of sex determination in higher plants. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

Simultaneously, soybean populations, which comprise diverse subpopulations, have developed their own adaptive characteristics enhancing fitness, resistance, agronomic traits, and morphological features. The genetic traits underlying these characteristics play a fundamental role in improving other soybean populations. Results: This study focused on identifying the selection signatures and adaptive characteristics in soybean populations. A core set of 245 accessions (112 wild-type, 79 landrace, and 54 improvement soybeans) selected from 4,234 soybean accessions was re-sequenced. Their genomic architectures were examined according to the domestication and improvement, and accessions were then classified into 3 wild-type, 2 landrace, and 2 improvement subgroups based on various population analyses. Selection and gene set enrichment analyses revealed that the landrace subgroups have selection signals for soybean-cyst nematode HG type 0 and seed development with germination, and that the improvement subgroups have selection signals for plant development with viability and seed development with embryo development, respectively. The adaptive characteristic for soybean-cyst nematode was partially underpinned by multiple resistance accessions, and the characteristics related to seed development were supported by our phenotypic findings for seed weights. Furthermore, their adaptive characteristics were also confirmed as genome-based evidence, and unique genomic regions that exhibit distinct selection and selective sweep patterns were revealed for 13 candidate genes. Conclusions: Although our findings require further biological validation, they provide valuable information about soybean breeding strategies and present new options for breeders seeking donor lines to improve soybean populations. © 2019 The Author(s).

Together with Tetracentron sinense, the family is unique in having secondary xylem without vessel elements, long considered to be a primitive character also found in Amborella and Winteraceae. Recent studies however have shown that Trochodendraceae belong to basal eudicots and demonstrate that this represents an evolutionary reversal for the group. Trochodendron aralioides is widespread in cultivation and popular for use in gardens and parks. FINDINGS: We assembled the T. aralioides genome using a total of 679.56 Gb of clean reads that were generated using both Pacific Biosciences and Illumina short-reads in combination with 10XGenomics and Hi-C data. Nineteen scaffolds corresponding to 19 chromosomes were assembled to a final size of 1.614 Gb with a scaffold N50 of 73.37 Mb in addition to 1,534 contigs. Repeat sequences accounted for 64.226% of the genome, and 35,328 protein-coding genes with an average of 5.09 exons per gene were annotated using de novo, RNA-sequencing, and homology-based approaches. According to a phylogenetic analysis of protein-coding genes, T. aralioides diverged in a basal position relative to core eudicots, ∼121.8-125.8 million years ago. CONCLUSIONS: Trochodendron aralioides is the first chromosome-scale genome assembled in the order Trochodendrales. It represents the largest genome assembled to date in the basal eudicot grade, as well as the closest order relative to the core-eudicots, as the position of Buxales remains unresolved. This genome will support further studies of wood morphology and floral evolution, and will be an essential resource for understanding rapid changes that took place at the base of the Eudicot tree. Finally, it can further genome-assisted improvement for cultivation and conservation efforts of the wheel tree. © The Author(s) 2019.

Paragonimiasis is acquired from infected undercooked crustaceans and primarily affects the lungs but often causes lesions elsewhere including the brain. The disease is easily mistaken for tuberculosis owing to similar pulmonary symptoms, and accordingly, diagnostics are in demand. Results: We assembled, annotated, and compared draft genomes of 4 prevalent and distinct Paragonimus species: Paragonimus miyazakii, Paragonimus westermani, Paragonimus kellicotti, and Paragonimus heterotremus. Genomes ranged from 697 to 923 Mb, included 12,072-12,853 genes, and were 71.6-90.1% complete according to BUSCO. Orthologous group analysis spanning 21 species (lung, liver, and blood flukes, additional platyhelminths, and hosts) provided insights into lung fluke biology. We identified 256 lung fluke-specific and conserved orthologous groups with consistent transcriptional adult-stage Paragonimus expression profiles and enriched for iron acquisition, immune modulation, and other parasite functions. Previously identified Paragonimus diagnostic antigens were matched to genes, providing an opportunity to optimize and ensure pan-Paragonimus reactivity for diagnostic assays. Conclusions: This report provides advances in molecular understanding of Paragonimus and underpins future studies into the biology, evolution, and pathogenesis of Paragonimus and related foodborne flukes. We anticipate that these novel genomic and transcriptomic resources will be invaluable for future lung fluke research. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

Currently, little genomic information for E. pauciflora is available. Here, we sequentially assemble the genome of Eucalyptus pauciflora with different methods, and combine multiple existing and novel approaches to help to select the best genome assembly. Findings: We generated high coverage of long- (Nanopore, 174×) and short- (Illumina, 228×) read data from a single E. pauciflora individual and compared assemblies from 5 assemblers (Canu, SMARTdenovo, Flye, Marvel, and MaSuRCA) with different read lengths (1 and 35 kb minimum read length). A key component of our approach is to keep a randomly selected collection of ∼10% of both long and short reads separated from the assemblies to use as a validation set for assessing assemblies. Using this validation set along with a range of existing tools, we compared the assemblies in 8 ways: contig N50, BUSCO scores, LAI (long terminal repeat assembly index) scores, assembly ploidy, base-level error rate, CGAL (computing genome assembly likelihoods) scores, structural variation, and genome sequence similarity. Our result showed that MaSuRCA generated the best assembly, which is 594.87 Mb in size, with a contig N50 of 3.23 Mb, and an estimated error rate of ∼0.006 errors per base. Conclusions: We report a draft genome of E. pauciflora, which will be a valuable resource for further genomic studies of eucalypts. The approaches for assessing and comparing genomes should help in assessing and choosing among many potential genome assemblies from a single dataset. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

This leads to duplication of effort, increased costs, and suboptimal annotation quality. One way to address these issues is to encourage the adoption of annotation standards and technological solutions that enable the sharing of biological knowledge and tools for genome and proteome annotation. Results: Here we demonstrate one approach to generate portable genome and proteome annotation pipelines that users can run without recourse to custom software. This proof of concept uses our own rule-based annotation pipeline HAMAP, which provides functional annotation for protein sequences to the same depth and quality as UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards Resource Description Framework (RDF) and SPARQL (a recursive acronym for the SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language). We translate complex HAMAP rules into the W3C standard SPARQL 1.1 syntax, and then apply them to protein sequences in RDF format using freely available SPARQL engines. This approach supports the generation of annotation that is identical to that generated by our own in-house pipeline, using standard, off-the-shelf solutions, and is applicable to any genome or proteome annotation pipeline. Conclusions: HAMAP SPARQL rules are freely available for download from the HAMAP FTP site, ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/hamap/sparql/, under the CC-BY-ND 4.0 license. The annotations generated by the rules are under the CC-BY 4.0 license.

To examine the evolutionary history of green plants in a phylogenomic framework, the 1KP project sequenced >1,000 transcriptomes across the Viridiplantae. The 1KP project provided a unique opportunity to study the distribution and occurrence of WGDs across the green plants. As an accompaniment to the capstone publication, this article provides expanded methodological details, results validation, and descriptions of newly released datasets that will aid researchers who wish to use the extended data generated by the 1KP project. Results: In the 1KP capstone analyses, we used a total evidence approach that combined inferences of WGDs from Ks and phylogenomic methods to infer and place 244 putative ancient WGDs across the Viridiplantae. Here, we provide an expanded explanation of our approach by describing our methodology and walk-through examples. We also evaluated the consistency of our WGD inferences by comparing them to evidence from published syntenic analyses of plant genome assemblies. We find that our inferences are consistent with whole-genome synteny analyses and our total evidence approach may minimize the false-positive rate throughout the dataset. Conclusions: We release 383,679 nuclear gene family phylogenies and 2,306 gene age distributions with Ks plots from the 1KP capstone paper.

Results: Chromosome-Scale Assembler (CSA) is a novel computationally highly efficient bioinformatics pipeline that fills this gap. CSA integrates information from scaffolded assemblies (e.g., Hi-C or 10X Genomics) or even from diverged reference genomes into the assembly process. As CSA performs automated assembly of chromosome-sized scaffolds, we benchmark its performance against state-of-the-art reference genomes, i.e., conventionally built in a laborious fashion using multiple separate assembly tools and manual curation. CSA increases the contig lengths using scaffolding, local re-assembly, and gap closing. On certain datasets, initial contig N50 may be increased up to 4.5-fold. For smaller vertebrate genomes, chromosome-scale assemblies can be achieved within 12 h using low-cost, high-end desktop computers. Mammalian genomes can be processed within 16 h on compute-servers. Using diverged reference genomes for fish, birds, and mammals, we demonstrate that CSA calculates chromosome-scale assemblies from long-read data and genome comparisons alone. Even contig-level draft assemblies of diverged genomes are helpful for reconstructing chromosome-scale sequences. CSA is also capable of assembling ultra-long reads.

Being at the interface of proteomics/metabolomics and imaging, the acquired datasets are large and complex and often analyzed with proprietary software or in-house scripts, which hinders reproducibility. Open source software solutions that enable reproducible data analysis often require programming skills and are therefore not accessible to many mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) researchers. Findings: We have integrated 18 dedicated mass spectrometry imaging tools into the Galaxy framework to allow accessible, reproducible, and transparent data analysis. Our tools are based on Cardinal, MALDIquant, and scikit-image and enable all major MSI analysis steps such as quality control, visualization, preprocessing, statistical analysis, and image co-registration. Furthermore, we created hands-on training material for use cases in proteomics and metabolomics. To demonstrate the utility of our tools, we re-analyzed a publicly available N-linked glycan imaging dataset. By providing the entire analysis history online, we highlight how the Galaxy framework fosters transparent and reproducible research. Conclusion: The Galaxy framework has emerged as a powerful analysis platform for the analysis of MSI data with ease of use and access, together with high levels of reproducibility and transparency. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Clustering RNA sequences with common sequence and structure is an essential step towards studying RNA function. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques, experimental and genomic data are expanding to complement the predictive methods. However, the existing methods do not effectively utilize and cope with the immense amount of data becoming available. Results: Hundreds of thousands of non-coding RNAs have been detected; however, their annotation is lagging behind. Here we present GraphClust2, a comprehensive approach for scalable clustering of RNAs based on sequence and structural similarities. GraphClust2 bridges the gap between high-throughput sequencing and structural RNA analysis and provides an integrative solution by incorporating diverse experimental and genomic data in an accessible manner via the Galaxy framework. GraphClust2 can efficiently cluster and annotate large datasets of RNAs and supports structure-probing data. We demonstrate that the annotation performance of clustering functional RNAs can be considerably improved. Furthermore, an off-the-shelf procedure is introduced for identifying locally conserved structure candidates in long RNAs. We suggest the presence and the sparseness of phylogenetically conserved local structures for a collection of long non-coding RNAs. Conclusions: By clustering data from 2 cross-linking immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of GraphClust2 for motif discovery under the presence of biological and methodological biases. Finally, we uncover prominent targets of double-stranded RNA binding protein Roquin-1, such as BCOR's 3′ untranslated region that contains multiple binding stem-loops that are evolutionary conserved. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Some weeds have morphological features similar to crops, making them difficult to discriminate.

Opening and closing morphological operators were applied to filter noise in plant images. The images at 4 stages of growth were collected using a testbed system. Mask-based local binary pattern features were combined with filtered features and a coefficient k. The classification of crops and weeds was achieved using support vector machine with radial basis function kernel. By investigating optimal parameters, this method reached a classification accuracy of 98.63% with 4 classes in the ""bccr-segset"" dataset published online in comparison with an accuracy of 91.85% attained by a previously reported method.

A key factor that affects the power of comparative analyses is the number of species included in a genome alignment. Results: To utilize the increased number of sequenced genomes and to provide an accessible resource for genomic studies, we generated a mammalian genome alignment comprising 120 species. We used this alignment and the CESAR method to provide protein-coding gene annotations for 119 non-human mammals. Furthermore, we illustrate the utility of this alignment by 2 exemplary analyses. First, we quantified how variable ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are among placental mammals. Leveraging the high taxonomic coverage in our alignment, we estimate that UCEs contain on average 4.7%-15.6% variable alignment columns. Furthermore, we show that the center regions of UCEs are generally most constrained. Second, we identified enhancer sequences that are only conserved in placental mammals. We found that these enhancers are significantly associated with placenta-related genes, suggesting that some of these enhancers may be involved in the evolution of placental mammal-specific aspects of the placenta.

Advances in whole genome sequencing technologies have led to a vast expansion in the amount of bacterial genomes deposited in public databases. There is a pressing need for software solutions which are able to cluster, catalogue and characterise genes, or other features, in increasingly large genomic datasets. Results: Here we present a pangenomics toolbox, PIRATE (Pangenome Iterative Refinement and Threshold Evaluation), which identifies and classifies orthologous gene families in bacterial pangenomes over a wide range of sequence similarity thresholds. PIRATE builds upon recent scalable software developments to allow for the rapid interrogation of thousands of isolates. PIRATE clusters genes (or other annotated features) over a wide range of amino acid or nucleotide identity thresholds and uses the clustering information to rapidly identify paralogous gene families and putative fission/fusion events. Furthermore, PIRATE orders the pangenome using a directed graph, provides a measure of allelic variation, and estimates sequence divergence for each gene family. Conclusions: We demonstrate that PIRATE scales linearly with both number of samples and computation resources, allowing for analysis of large genomic datasets, and compares favorably to other popular tools. PIRATE provides a robust framework for analysing bacterial pangenomes, from largely clonal to panmictic species. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

However, there are few published SSVEP datasets for brain-computer interface. In this study, we obtained a new SSVEP dataset based on measurements from 30 participants, performed on 2 days; our dataset complements existing SSVEP datasets: (i) multi-band SSVEP datasets are provided, and all 3 possible frequency bands (low, middle, and high) were used for SSVEP stimulation; (ii) multi-day datasets are included; and (iii) the EEG datasets include simultaneously obtained physiological measurements, such as respiration, electrocardiography, electromyography, and head motion (accelerator). FINDINGS: To validate our dataset, we estimated the spectral powers and classification performance for the EEG (SSVEP) datasets and created an example plot to visualize the physiological time-series data. Strong SSVEP responses were observed at stimulation frequencies, and the mean classification performance of the middle frequency band was significantly higher than the low- and high-frequency bands. Other physiological data also showed reasonable results. CONCLUSIONS: Our multi-band, multi-day SSVEP datasets can be used to optimize stimulation frequencies because they enable simultaneous investigation of the characteristics of the SSVEPs evoked in each of the 3 frequency bands, and solve session-to-session (day-to-day) transfer problems by enabling investigation of the non-stationarity of SSVEPs measured on different days. Additionally, auxiliary physiological data can be used to explore the relationship between SSVEP characteristics and physiological conditions, providing useful information for optimizing experimental paradigms to achieve high performance. © The Author(s) 2019.

Distinguished from other blowflies, Aldrichina grahami has some unique biological characteristics and is a species of forensic importance. Its development rate, pattern, and life cycle can provide valuable information for the estimation of the minimum postmortem interval. Findings: Herein we provide a chromosome-level genome assembly of A. grahami that was generated by Pacific BioSciences sequencing platform and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technology. A total of 50.15 Gb clean reads of the A. grahami genome were generated. FALCON and Wtdbg were used to construct the genome of A. grahami, resulting in an assembly of 600 Mb and 1,604 contigs with an N50 size of 1.93 Mb. We predicted 12,823 protein-coding genes, 99.8% of which was functionally annotated on the basis of the de novo genome (SRA: PRJNA513084) and transcriptome (SRA: SRX5207346) of A. grahami. According to the co-analysis with 11 other insect species, clustering and phylogenetic reconstruction of gene families were performed. Using Hi-C sequencing, a chromosome-level assembly of 6 chromosomes was generated with scaffold N50 of 104.7 Mb. Of these scaffolds, 96.4% were anchored to the total A. grahami genome contig bases. Conclusions: The present study provides a robust genome reference for A. grahami that supplements vital genetic information for nonhuman forensic genomics and facilitates the future research of A. grahami and other necrophagous blowfly species used in forensic medicine.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Animals; Calliphoridae; Chromosomes, Insect; Female; Forensic Genetics; Genome, Insect; Male; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Transcriptome; transcriptome; transcriptome; adult; Aldrichina grahami; animal tissue; Article; Calliphoridae; chromosome conformation capture; contig mapping; controlled study; criminalistics; female; forensic entomology; gene cluster; gene sequence; genome analysis; genome size; human; human tissue; insect chromosome; male; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; species comparison; animal; Calliphoridae; forensic genetics; genetics; insect chromosome; insect genome; molecular genetics; procedures","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082034106"

While it promises unparalleled insights into the genetic content of the biological samples studied, conclusions drawn are at risk from biases inherent to the DNA sequencing methods, including inaccurate abundance estimates as a function of genomic guanine-cytosine (GC) contents. Results: We explored such GC biases across many commonly used platforms in experiments sequencing multiple genomes (with mean GC contents ranging from 28.9% to 62.4%) and metagenomes. GC bias profiles varied among different library preparation protocols and sequencing platforms. We found that our workflows using MiSeq and NextSeq were hindered by major GC biases, with problems becoming increasingly severe outside the 45-65% GC range, leading to a falsely low coverage in GC-rich and especially GC-poor sequences, where genomic windows with 30% GC content had >10-fold less coverage than windows close to 50% GC content. We also showed that GC content correlates tightly with coverage biases. The PacBio and HiSeq platforms also evidenced similar profiles of GC biases to each other, which were distinct from those seen in the MiSeq and NextSeq workflows. The Oxford Nanopore workflow was not afflicted by GC bias. Conclusions: These findings indicate potential sources of difficulty, arising from GC biases, in genome sequencing that could be pre-emptively addressed with methodological optimizations provided that the GC biases inherent to the relevant workflow are understood. Furthermore, it is recommended that a more critical approach be taken in quantitative abundance estimates in metagenomic studies.

The composition of the various cell types making up the microenvironment can significantly affect the way in which the immune system activates cancer rejection mechanisms. Understanding the cross-Talk signals between immune cells and cancer cells is of fundamental importance for the identification of immuno-oncology therapeutic targets. Results: We present a novel method, single-cell Tumor-Host Interaction tool (scTHI), to identify significantly activated ligand-receptor interactions across clusters of cells from single-cell RNA sequencing data. We apply our approach to uncover the ligand-receptor interactions in glioma using 6 publicly available human glioma datasets encompassing 57,060 gene expression profiles from 71 patients. By leveraging this large-scale collection we show that unexpected cross-Talk partners are highly conserved across different datasets in the majority of the tumor samples. This suggests that shared cross-Talk mechanisms exist in glioma. Conclusions: Our results provide a complete map of the active tumor-host interaction pairs in glioma that can be therapeutically exploited to reduce the immunosuppressive action of the microenvironment in brain tumor. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

Because of its low cost, robust databases, and established bioinformatic workflows, sequencing of 16S/18S/ITS ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicons, which provides a marker of choice for phylogenetic studies, has become ubiquitous. Many established end-to-end bioinformatic pipelines are available to perform short amplicon sequence data analysis. These pipelines suit a general audience, but few options exist for more specialized users who are experienced in code scripting, Linux-based systems, and high-performance computing (HPC) environments. For such an audience, existing pipelines can be limiting to fully leverage modern HPC capabilities and perform tweaking and optimization operations. Moreover, a wealth of stand-alone software packages that perform specific targeted bioinformatic tasks are increasingly accessible, and finding a way to easily integrate these applications in a pipeline is critical to the evolution of bioinformatic methodologies. Results: Here we describe AmpliconTagger, a short rRNA marker gene amplicon pipeline coded in a Python framework that enables fine tuning and integration of virtually any potential rRNA gene amplicon bioinformatic procedure. It is designed to work within an HPC environment, supporting a complex network of job dependencies with a smart-restart mechanism in case of job failure or parameter modifications. As proof of concept, we present end results obtained with AmpliconTagger using 16S, 18S, ITS rRNA short gene amplicons and Pacific Biosciences long-read amplicon data types as input. Conclusions: Using a selection of published algorithms for generating operational taxonomic units and amplicon sequence variants and for computing downstream taxonomic summaries and diversity metrics, we demonstrate the performance and versatility of our pipeline for systematic analyses of amplicon sequence data. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Results: In this study, we describe the demographic events and selective pressures of buffalo by analyzing 121 whole genomes (98 newly reported) from 25 swamp and river buffalo breeds. Both uniparental and biparental markers were investigated to provide the final scenario. The ancestors of swamp and river buffalo diverged ∼0.23 million years ago and then experienced independent demographic histories. They were domesticated in different regions, the swamp buffalo at the border between southwest China and southeast Asia, while the river buffalo in south Asia. The domestic stocks migrated to other regions and further differentiated, as testified by (at least) 2 ancestral components identified in each subspecies. Different signals of selective pressures were also detected in these 2 types of buffalo. The swamp buffalo, historically used as a draft animal, shows selection signatures in genes associated with the nervous system, while in river dairy breeds, genes under selection are related to heat stress and immunity. Conclusions: Our findings substantially expand the catalogue of genetic variants in buffalo and reveal new insights into the evolutionary history and distinct selective pressures in river and swamp buffalo. © The Author(s) 2020.

A number of tools designed to quickly align a large volume of sequences are already available. However, most existing tools lack explicit guarantees about their output. They also do not support searching genome assemblies, such as the human genome assembly GRCh38, that include primary and alternate sequences and placement information for alternate sequences to primary sequences in the assembly. Findings: This paper describes SRPRISM (Single Read Paired Read Indel Substitution Minimizer), an alignment tool for aligning reads without splices. SRPRISM has features not available in most tools, such as (i) support for searching genome assemblies with alternate sequences, (ii) partial alignment of reads with a specified region of reads to be included in the alignment, (iii) choice of ranking schemes for alignments, and (iv) explicit criteria for search sensitivity. We compare the performance of SRPRISM to GEM, Kart, STAR, BWA-MEM, Bowtie2, Hobbes, and Yara using benchmark sets for paired and single reads of lengths 100 and 250 bp generated using DWGSIM. SRPRISM found the best results for most benchmark sets with error rate of up to ∼2.5% and GEM performed best for higher error rates. SRPRISM was also more sensitive than other tools even when sensitivity was reduced to improve run time performance. Conclusions: We present SRPRISM as a flexible read mapping tool that provides explicit guarantees on results. © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.

It blossoms in the winter and ripens in the early summer. The genome of loquat has to date not been published, which limits the study of molecular biology in this cultivated species. Here, we used the third-generation sequencing technology of Nanopore and Hi-C technology to sequence the genome of Eriobotrya. Findings: We generated 100.10 Gb of long reads using Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies. Three types of Illumina high-throughput sequencing data, including genome short reads (47.42 Gb), transcriptome short reads (11.06 Gb), and Hi-C short reads (67.25 Gb), were also generated to help construct the loquat genome. All data were assembled into a 760.1-Mb genome assembly. The contigs were mapped to chromosomes by using Hi-C technology based on the contacts between contigs, and then a genome was assembled exhibiting 17 chromosomes and a scaffold N50 length of 39.7 Mb. A total of 45,743 protein-coding genes were annotated in the Eriobotrya genome, and we investigated the phylogenetic relationships between the Eriobotrya and 6 other Rosaceae species. Eriobotrya shows a close relationship with Malus and Pyrus, with the divergence time of Eriobotrya and Malus being 6.76 million years ago. Furthermore, chromosome rearrangement was found in Eriobotrya and Malus. Conclusions: We constructed the first high-quality chromosome-level Eriobotrya genome using Illumina, Nanopore, and Hi-C technologies. This work provides a valuable reference genome for molecular studies of the loquat and provides new insight into chromosome evolution in this species. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Plant; Eriobotrya; Genome, Plant; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Nanopore Sequencing; Phylogeny; Whole Genome Sequencing; transcriptome; Article; chromosome rearrangement; contig mapping; Eriobotrya; gene structure; genetic variability; genome size; illumina sequencing; loquat; Malus; molecular evolution; nanopore sequencing; nonhuman; phylogeny; plant chromosome; plant genome; priority journal; Pyrus; Rosaceae; chromosomal mapping; classification; genetics; molecular genetics; plant chromosome; whole genome sequencing","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081529518"

It mediates the interaction between an organism and its environment from multiple important aspects. However, the physicochemical basis of color coding has not been explored completely, and how color perception is integrated with other sensory input, typically odor, is unclear. Results: Here, we developed an artificial intelligence platform to train algorithms for distinguishing color and odor based on the large-scale physicochemical features of 1,267 and 598 structurally diverse molecules, respectively. The predictive accuracies achieved using the random forest and deep belief network for the prediction of color were 100% and 95.23% ± 0.40% (mean ± SD), respectively. The predictive accuracies achieved using the random forest and deep belief network for the prediction of odor were 93.40% ± 0.31% and 94.75% ± 0.44% (mean ± SD), respectively. Twenty-four physicochemical features were sufficient for the accurate prediction of color, while 39 physicochemical features were sufficient for the accurate prediction of odor. A positive correlation between the color-coding and odor-coding properties of the molecules was predicted. A group of descriptors was found to interlink prominently in color and odor perceptions. Conclusions: Our random forest model and deep belief network accurately predicted the colors and odors of structurally diverse molecules. These findings extend our understanding of the molecular and structural basis of color vision and reveal the interrelationship between color and odor perceptions in nature. © The Author(s) 2020.

These tools depend upon the Bos taurus reference genome (UMD3.1.1), which was created using now-outdated technologies and is hindered by a variety of deficiencies and inaccuracies. Results: We present the new reference genome for cattle, ARS-UCD1.2, based on the same animal as the original to facilitate transfer and interpretation of results obtained from the earlier version, but applying a combination of modern technologies in a de novo assembly to increase continuity, accuracy, and completeness. The assembly includes 2.7 Gb and is >250× more continuous than the original assembly, with contig N50 >25 Mb and L50 of 32. We also greatly expanded supporting RNA-based data for annotation that identifies 30,396 total genes (21,039 protein coding). The new reference assembly is accessible in annotated form for public use. Conclusions: We demonstrate that improved continuity of assembled sequence warrants the adoption of ARS-UCD1.2 as the new cattle reference genome and that increased assembly accuracy will benefit future research on this species.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.","Animals; Breeding; Cattle; Genome; Genomics; Polymorphism, Genetic; Reference Standards; RNA-Seq; Sequence Analysis, DNA; animal tissue; Article; genome; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; priority journal; RNA sequencing; taurine cattle; animal; bovine; breeding; DNA sequence; genetic polymorphism; genetics; genomics; procedures; standard","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082088552"

These species diverged ∼7.5 million years ago, making this rather young genus an interesting system to study a wide range of questions including the process of speciation, ecological adaptation, and adaptive radiation. Results: Here we present a high-quality genome assembly of the bat hawkmoth Hyles vespertilio, the first reference genome of a member of the Hyles genus. We generated 51× Pacific Biosciences long reads with an average read length of 8.9 kb. Pacific Biosciences reads longer than 4 kb were assembled into contigs, resulting in a 651.4-Mb assembly consisting of 530 contigs with an N50 value of 7.5 Mb. The circular mitochondrial contig has a length of 15,303 bp. The H. vespertilio genome is very repeat-rich and exhibits a higher repeat content (50.3%) than other Bombycoidea species such as Bombyx mori (45.7%) and Manduca sexta (27.5%). We developed a comprehensive gene annotation workflow to obtain consensus gene models from different evidence including gene projections, protein homology, transcriptome data, and ab initio predictions. The resulting gene annotation is highly complete with 94.5% of BUSCO genes being completely present, which is higher than the BUSCO completeness of the B. mori (92.2%) and M. sexta (90%) annotations. Conclusions: Our gene annotation strategy has general applicability to other genomes, and the H. vespertilio genome provides a valuable molecular resource to study a range of questions in this genus, including phylogeny, incomplete lineage sorting, speciation, and hybridization.

For de novo assembly, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) are the favorite options. However, PacBio's SMRT sequencing is expensive for a full human genome assembly and costs more than $40,000 US for 30× coverage as of 2019. ONT PromethION sequencing, on the other hand, is 1/12 the price of PacBio for the same coverage. This study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of ONT PromethION and PacBio's SMRT sequencing in relation to the quality. Findings: We performed whole-genome de novo assemblies and comparison to construct an improved version of KOREF, the Korean reference genome, using sequencing data produced by PromethION and PacBio. With PromethION, an assembly using sequenced reads with 64× coverage (193 Gb, 3 flowcell sequencing) resulted in 3,725 contigs with N50s of 16.7 Mb and a total genome length of 2.8 Gb. It was comparable to a KOREF assembly constructed using PacBio at 62× coverage (188 Gb, 2,695 contigs, and N50s of 17.9 Mb). When we applied Hi-C-derived long-range mapping data, an even higher quality assembly for the 64× coverage was achieved, resulting in 3,179 scaffolds with an N50 of 56.4 Mb. Conclusion: The pore-based PromethION approach provided a high-quality chromosome-scale human genome assembly at a low cost with long maximum contig and scaffold lengths and was more cost-effective than PacBio at comparable quality measurements. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

A cornerstone of NGS is the quantification of RNA or DNA presence as counts. However, these counts are not counts per se: their magnitude is determined arbitrarily by the sequencing depth, not by the input material. Consequently, counts must undergo normalization prior to use. Conventional normalization methods require a set of assumptions: they assume that the majority of features are unchanged and that all environments under study have the same carrying capacity for nucleotide synthesis. These assumptions are often untestable and may not hold when heterogeneous samples are compared. Results: Methods developed within the field of compositional data analysis offer a general solution that is assumption-free and valid for all data. Herein, we synthesize the extant literature to provide a concise guide on how to apply compositional data analysis to NGS count data. Conclusions: In highlighting the limitations of total library size, effective library size, and spike-in normalizations, we propose the log-ratio transformation as a general solution to answer the question, ""Relative to some important activity of the cell, what is changing?"" © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

From genome structure to population dynamics, many applications involve the use of genetic variants. The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies led to such a flood of data that the daily work of scientists is often more focused on data management than data analysis. This mass of genotyping data poses several computational challenges in terms of storage, search, sharing, analysis, and visualization. While existing tools try to solve these challenges, few of them offer a comprehensive and scalable solution. Results: Gigwa v2 is an easy-to-use, species-agnostic web application for managing and exploring high-density genotyping data. It can handle multiple databases and may be installed on a local computer or deployed as an online data portal. It supports various standard import and export formats, provides advanced filtering options, and offers means to visualize density charts or push selected data into various stand-alone or online tools. It implements 2 standard RESTful application programming interfaces, GA4GH, which is health-oriented, and BrAPI, which is breeding-oriented, thus offering wide possibilities of interaction with third-party applications. The project home page provides a list of live instances allowing users to test the system on public data (or reasonably sized user-provided data). Conclusions: This new version of Gigwa provides a more intuitive and more powerful way to explore large amounts of genotyping data by offering a scalable solution to search for genotype patterns, functional annotations, or more complex filtering. Furthermore, its user-friendliness and interoperability make it widely accessible to the life science community. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

Current barcoding protocols often rely on short amplicon sequences, which yield accurate identification of biological entities in a community but provide limited phylogenetic resolution across broad taxonomic scales. However, the phylogenetic structure of communities is an essential component of biodiversity. Consequently, a barcoding approach is required that unites robust taxonomic assignment power and high phylogenetic utility. A possible solution is offered by sequencing long ribosomal DNA (rDNA) amplicons on the MinION platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Findings: Using a dataset of various animal and plant species, with a focus on arthropods, we assemble a pipeline for long rDNA barcode analysis and introduce a new software (MiniBar) to demultiplex dual indexed Nanopore reads. We find excellent phylogenetic and taxonomic resolution offered by long rDNA sequences across broad taxonomic scales. We highlight the simplicity of our approach by field barcoding with a miniaturized, mobile laboratory in a remote rainforest. We also test the utility of long rDNA amplicons for analysis of community diversity through metabarcoding and find that they recover highly skewed diversity estimates. Conclusions: Sequencing dual indexed, long rDNA amplicons on the MinION platform is a straightforward, cost-effective, portable, and universal approach for eukaryote DNA barcoding. Although bulk community analyses using long-amplicon approaches may introduce biases, the long rDNA amplicons approach signifies a powerful tool for enabling the accurate recovery of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity across biological communities. © The Author(s) 2019.

Respiratory metagenomic analysis demands a comprehensive microbial gene catalogue, which will significantly advance our understanding of host-microorganism interactions. Results: We collected 334 respiratory microbial samples from 171 healthy children and 76 children with pneumonia. The respiratory microbial gene catalogue we established comprised 2.25 million non-redundant microbial genes, covering 90.52% of prevalent genes. The major oropharyngeal microbial species found in healthy children were Prevotella and Streptococcus. In children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP), oropharyngeal microbial diversity and associated gene numbers decreased compared with those of healthy children. The concurrence network of oropharyngeal microorganisms in patients predominantly featured Staphylococcus spp. and M. pneumoniae. Functional orthologues, which are associated with the metabolism of various lipids, membrane transport, and signal transduction, accumulated in the oropharyngeal microbiome of children with pneumonia. Several antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factor genes were identified in the genomes of M. pneumoniae and 13 other microorganisms reconstructed via metagenomic data. Although the common macrolide/β-lactam resistance genes were not identified in the assembled M. pneumoniae genome, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (A2063G) related to macrolide resistance was identified in a 23S ribosomal RNA gene. Conclusions: The results of this study will facilitate exploration of unknown microbial components and host-microorganism interactions in studies of the respiratory microbiome. They will also yield further insights into the microbial aetiology of MPP. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Along with software packaged in containers, the standardized workflow descriptors Common Workflow Language (CWL) enable data to be easily analyzed on multiple computing environments. These technologies accelerate the use of on-demand cloud computing platforms, which can be scaled according to the quantity of data. However, to optimize the time and budgetary restraints of cloud usage, users must select a suitable instance type that corresponds to the resource requirements of their workflows. Results: We developed CWL-metrics, a utility tool for cwltool (the reference implementation of CWL), to collect runtime metrics of Docker containers and workflow metadata to analyze workflow resource requirements. To demonstrate the use of this tool, we analyzed 7 transcriptome quantification workflows on 6 instance types. The results revealed that choice of instance type can deliver lower financial costs and faster execution times using the required amount of computational resources. Conclusions: CWL-metrics can generate a summary of resource requirements for workflow executions, which can help users to optimize their use of cloud computing by selecting appropriate instances. The runtime metrics data generated by CWL-metrics can also help users to share workflows between different workflow management frameworks. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

However, the best approaches for analysis of long-read metagenomic data are unknown. Additionally, rigorous evaluation of bioinformatics tools is hindered by a lack of long-read data from validated samples with known composition. Findings: We sequenced 2 commercially available mock communities containing 10 microbial species (ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standards) with Oxford Nanopore GridION and PromethION. Both communities and the 10 individual species isolates were also sequenced with Illumina technology. We generated 14 and 16 gigabase pairs from 2 GridION flowcells and 150 and 153 gigabase pairs from 2 PromethION flowcells for the evenly distributed and log-distributed communities, respectively. Read length N50 ranged between 5.3 and 5.4 kilobase pairs over the 4 sequencing runs. Basecalls and corresponding signal data are made available (4.2 TB in total). Alignment to Illumina-sequenced isolates demonstrated the expected microbial species at anticipated abundances, with the limit of detection for the lowest abundance species below 50 cells (GridION). De novo assembly of metagenomes recovered long contiguous sequences without the need for pre-processing techniques such as binning. Conclusions: We present ultra-deep, long-read nanopore datasets from a well-defined mock community. These datasets will be useful for those developing bioinformatics methods for long-read metagenomics and for the validation and comparison of current laboratory and software pipelines. © The Author(s) 2019.

In particular, for non-model organisms and in the absence of an appropriate reference genome, RNA-Seq is used to reconstruct the transcriptome de novo. Although the de novo transcriptome assembly of non-model organisms has been on the rise recently and new tools are frequently developing, there is still a knowledge gap about which assembly software should be used to build a comprehensive de novo assembly. Results: Here, we present a large-scale comparative study in which 10 de novo assembly tools are applied to 9 RNA-Seq data sets spanning different kingdoms of life. Overall, we built >200 single assemblies and evaluated their performance on a combination of 20 biological-based and reference-free metrics. Our study is accompanied by a comprehensive and extensible Electronic Supplement that summarizes all data sets, assembly execution instructions, and evaluation results. Trinity, SPAdes, and Trans-ABySS, followed by Bridger and SOAPdenovo-Trans, generally outperformed the other tools compared. Moreover, we observed species-specific differences in the performance of each assembler. No tool delivered the best results for all data sets. Conclusions: We recommend a careful choice and normalization of evaluation metrics to select the best assembling results as a critical step in the reconstruction of a comprehensive de novo transcriptome assembly. © The Author(s) 2019.

In addition to causing direct damage by removing photoassimilates, R. maidis transmits several destructive maize viruses, including maize yellow dwarf virus, barley yellow dwarf virus, sugarcane mosaic virus, and cucumber mosaic virus. Findings: The genome of a parthenogenetically reproducing R. maidis clone was assembled with a combination of Pacific Biosciences (207-fold coverage) and Illumina (83-fold coverage) sequencing. The 689 assembled contigs, which have an N50 size of 9.0 megabases (Mb) and a low level of heterozygosity, were clustered using Phase Genomics Hi-C interaction maps. Consistent with the commonly observed 2n = 8 karyotype of R. maidis, most of the contigs (473 spanning 321 Mb) were successfully oriented into 4 scaffolds. The genome assembly captured the full length of 95.8% of the core eukaryotic genes, indicating that it is highly complete. Repetitive sequences accounted for 21.2% of the assembly, and a total of 17,629 protein-coding genes were predicted with integrated evidence from ab initio and homology-based gene predictions and transcriptome sequences generated with both Pacific Biosciences and Illumina. An analysis of likely horizontally transferred genes identified 2 from bacteria, 7 from fungi, 2 from protozoa, and 9 from algae. Repeat elements, transposons, and genes encoding likely detoxification enzymes (cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferases, carboxylesterases, uridine diphosphate-glucosyltransferases, and ABC transporters) were identified in the genome sequence. Other than Buchnera aphidicola (642,929 base pairs, 602 genes), no endosymbiont bacteria were found in R. maidis. Conclusions: A high-quality R. maidis genome was assembled at the chromosome level. This genome sequence will enable further research related to ecological interactions, virus transmission, pesticide resistance, and other aspects of R. maidis biology. It also serves as a valuable resource for comparative investigation of other aphid species. © The Author(s) 2019.

Moreover, sequence data can fail to map uniquely to the reference genome, making it difficult to unambiguously assign variation. Resequencing using target capture enables sequencing of large numbers of individuals at high coverage to reliably identify variants associated with important agronomic traits. Previous studies have implemented complementary DNA/exon or gene-based probe sets in which the promoter and intron sequence is largely missing alongside newly characterized genes from the recent improved reference sequences. Results: We present and validate 2 gold standard capture probe sets for hexaploid bread wheat, a gene and a putative promoter capture, which are designed using recently developed genome sequence and annotation resources. The captures can be combined or used independently. We demonstrate that the capture probe sets effectively enrich the high-confidence genes and putative promoter regions that were identified in the genome alongside a large proportion of the low-confidence genes and associated promoters. Finally, we demonstrate successful sample multiplexing that allows generation of adequate sequence coverage for single-nucleotide polymorphism calling while significantly reducing cost per sample for gene and putative promoter capture. Conclusions: We show that a capture design employing an ""island strategy"" can enable analysis of the large gene/putative promoter space of wheat with only 2 × 160 Mbp probe sets. Furthermore, these assays extend the regions of the wheat genome that are amenable to analyses beyond its exome, providing tools for detailed characterization of these regulatory regions in large populations. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

They provide platforms for studying molecular and developmental mechanisms involved in the formation of the basic bilaterian body plan, whole-body regeneration, and symbiosis with photosynthetic microalgae. Because genomic information is essential for future research on acoel biology, we sequenced and assembled the nuclear genome of an acoel, Praesagittifera naikaiensis. Findings: To avoid sequence contamination derived from symbiotic microalgae, DNA was extracted from embryos that were free of algae. More than 290x sequencing coverage was achieved using a combination of Illumina (paired-end and mate-pair libraries) and PacBio sequencing. RNA sequencing and Iso-Seq data from embryos, larvae, and adults were also obtained. First, a preliminary ∼17-kilobase pair (kb) mitochondrial genome was assembled, which was deleted from the nuclear sequence assembly. As a result, a draft nuclear genome assembly was ∼656 Mb in length, with a scaffold N50 of 117 kb and a contig N50 of 57 kb . Although ∼70% of the assembled sequences were likely composed of repetitive sequences that include DNA transposons and retrotransposons, the draft genome was estimated to contain 22,143 protein-coding genes, ∼99% of which were substantiated by corresponding transcripts. We could not find horizontally transferred microalgal genes in the acoel genome. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs analyses indicated that 77% of the conserved single-copy genes were complete. Pfam domain analyses provided a basic set of gene families for transcription factors and signaling molecules. Conclusions: Our present sequencing and assembly of the P. naikaiensis nuclear genome are comparable to those of other metazoan genomes, providing basic information for future studies of genic and genomic attributes of this animal group.

Yet, little evidence has been reported in characterizing the gut microbiota shift in atrial fibrillation. Methods: We include the result of the global alterations that occur in the intestinal microbiota in a cohort of 50 patients with atrial fibrillation and 50 matched controls based on a strategy of metagenomic and metabolomic analyses. Results: The alterations include a dramatic elevation in microbial diversity and a specific perturbation of gut microbiota composition. Overgrowth of Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, as well as reduction of Faecalibacterium, Alistipes, Oscillibacter, and Bilophila were detected in patients with atrial fibrillation. A gut microbial function imbalance and correlated metabolic pattern changes were observed with atrial fibrillation in both fecal and serum samples. The differential gut microbiome signatures could be used to identify patients with atrial fibrillation. Conclusions: Our findings characterize the disordered gut microbiota and microbial metabolite profiles in atrial fibrillation. Further research could determine whether intervention strategies targeting intestinal microbiome composition might be useful to counteract the progression of atrial fibrillation. © 2019 The Author(s).","Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Atrial Fibrillation; Bacteria; Feces; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Male; Metabolomics; Metagenomics; Middle Aged; Serum; adult; aged; Alistipes; Article; atrial fibrillation; bacterial overgrowth; bacterium; bacterium detection; Bilophila; blood sampling; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease course; dysbiosis; Enterococcus; Faecalibacterium; feces; female; human; intestine flora; male; metabolism; metabolomics; metagenomics; microbial diversity; Oscillibacter; pathogenesis; priority journal; Ruminococcus; species composition; Streptococcus; Asian continental ancestry group; atrial fibrillation; chemistry; genetics; microbiology; middle aged; serum","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067290735"

However, the isoform and posttranslational modification states of proteins are lost when converting input and pathways into gene-centric lists. Findings: Based on the Reactome knowledge base, we built a network of protein-protein interactions accounting for the documented isoform and modification statuses of proteins. We then implemented a command line application called PathwayMatcher (github.com/PathwayAnalysisPlatform/PathwayMatcher) to query this network. PathwayMatcher supports multiple types of omics data as input and outputs the possibly affected biochemical reactions, subnetworks, and pathways. Conclusions: PathwayMatcher enables refining the network representation of pathways by including proteoforms defined as protein isoforms with posttranslational modifications. The specificity of pathway analyses is hence adapted to different levels of granularity, and it becomes possible to distinguish interactions between different forms of the same protein. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Results: The draft assembly was obtained using short (Illumina) and long (PaciBio and Nanopore) sequencing reads. Our de novo assembly (1.36 Gb), which represents 80% of the genome size estimated by flow cytometry (1.7 Gb), is constituted by a high fraction of interspersed repetitive elements (53.8%). The assembly completeness, using BUSCO and core eukaryotic genes, ranges from 90% to 96%. Functional annotations based on both ab initio and evidence-based information (including D. silvatica RNA sequencing) yielded a total of 48,619 protein-coding sequences, of which 36,398 (74.9%) have the molecular hallmark of known protein domains, or sequence similarity with Swiss-Prot sequences. The D. silvatica assembly is the first representative of the superfamily Dysderoidea, and just the second available genome of Synspermiata, one of the major evolutionary lineages of the ""true spiders"" (Araneomorphae). Conclusions: Dysderoids, which are known for their numerous instances of adaptation to underground environments, include some of the few examples of trophic specialization within spiders and are excellent models for the study of cryptic female choice. This resource will be therefore useful as a starting point to study fundamental evolutionary and functional questions, including the molecular bases of the adaptation to extreme environments and ecological shifts, as well of the origin and evolution of relevant spider traits, such as the venom and silk. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

However, each of the >100 such managers uses its own way to describe pipelines, leading to difficulty porting workflows to different environments and therefore poor reproducibility of computational studies. For this reason, the Common Workflow Language (CWL) was recently introduced as a specification for platform-independent workflow description, and work began to transition existing pipelines and workflow managers to CWL. Findings: Herein, we present CWL-Airflow, a package that adds support for CWL to the Apache Airflow pipeline manager. CWL-Airflow uses CWL version 1.0 specification and can run workflows on stand-alone MacOS/Linux servers, on clusters, or on a variety of cloud platforms. A sample CWL pipeline for processing of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data is provided.

Seeds of yellowhorn are rich in oil containing unsaturated long-chain fatty acids that have been used for producing edible oil and nervonic acid capsules. However, the lack of a high-quality genome sequence hampers the understanding of its evolution and gene functions. Findings: In this study, a whole genome of yellowhorn was sequenced and assembled by integration of Illumina sequencing, Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time sequencing, 10X Genomics linked reads, Bionano optical maps, and Hi-C. The yellowhorn genome assembly was 439.97 Mb, which comprised 15 pseudo-chromosomes covering 95.42% (419.84 Mb) of the assembled genome. The repetitive fractions accounted for 56.39% of the yellowhorn genome. The genome contained 21,059 protein-coding genes. Of them, 18,503 (87.86%) genes were found to be functionally annotated with ≥1 ""annotation"" term by searching against other databases. Transcriptomic analysis showed that 341, 135, 125, 113, and 100 genes were specifically expressed in hermaphrodite flower, staminate flower, young fruit, leaf, and shoot, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that yellowhorn and Dimocarpus longan diverged from their most recent common ancestor ∼46 million years ago. Conclusions: The availability and subsequent annotation of the yellowhorn genome, as well as the identification of tissue-specific functional genes, provides a valuable reference for plant comparative genomics, evolutionary studies, and molecular design breeding. © 2019 The Author(s).

Often, these regulatory roles are a direct by-product of their close sequence homology to protein-coding genes. Novel pseudogene-gene (PGG) functional associations can be identified through the integration of biomedical data, such as sequence homology, functional pathways, gene expression, pseudogene expression, and microRNA expression. However, not all of the information has been integrated, and almost all previous pseudogene studies relied on 1:1 pseudogene–parent gene relationships without leveraging other homologous genes/pseudogenes. Results: We produce PGG families that expand beyond the current 1:1 paradigm. First, we construct expansive PGG databases by (i) CUDAlign graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated local alignment of all pseudogenes to gene families (totaling 1.6 billion individual local alignments and >40,000 GPU hours) and (ii) BLAST-based assignment of pseudogenes to gene families. Second, we create an open-source web application (PseudoFuN [Pseudogene Functional Networks]) to search for integrative functional relationships of sequence homology, microRNA expression, gene expression, pseudogene expression, and gene ontology. We produce four “flavors” of CUDAlign-based databases (>462,000,000 PGG pairwise alignments and 133,770 PGG families) that can be queried and downloaded using PseudoFuN. These databases are consistent with previous 1:1 PGG annotation and also are much more powerful including millions of de novo PGG associations. For example, we find multiple known (e.g., miR-20a-PTEN-PTENP1) and novel (e.g., miR-375-SOX15-PPP4R1L) microRNA-gene-pseudogene associations in prostate cancer. PseudoFuN provides a “one stop shop” for identifying and visualizing thousands of potential regulatory relationships related to pseudogenes in The Cancer Genome Atlas cancers. Conclusions: Thousands of new PGG associations can be explored in the context of microRNA-gene-pseudogene co-expression and differential expression with a simple-to-use online tool by bioinformaticians and oncologists alike. © The Author(s) 2018.

The most commonly used approach infers the methylation state of a given genomic region on the basis of the amount of nucleotide mis-incorporations observed at CpG dinucleotide sites. However, this approach overlooks a number of confounding factors, including the presence of sequencing errors and true variants. The scale and distribution of the inferred methylation measurements are also variable across samples, precluding direct comparisons. Findings: Here, we present DamMet, an open-source software program retrieving maximum likelihood estimates of regional CpG methylation levels from ancient DNA sequencing data. It builds on a novel statistical model of post-mortem DNA damage for dinucleotides, accounting for sequencing errors, genotypes, and differential post-mortem cytosine deamination rates at both methylated and unmethylated sites. To validate DamMet, we extended gargammel, a sequence simulator for ancient DNA data, by introducing methylation-dependent features of post-mortem DNA decay. This new simulator provides direct validation of DamMet predictions. Additionally, the methylation levels inferred by DamMet were found to be correlated to those inferred by epiPALEOMIX and both on par and directly comparable to those measured from whole-genome bisulphite sequencing experiments of fresh tissues. Conclusions: DamMet provides genuine estimates for local DNA methylation levels in ancient individual genomes.

In recent years, alternative splicing has been used as a prognosis biomarker, a therapy response biomarker, and even as a therapeutic target. Next-generation RNA sequencing has an unprecedented potential to measure the transcriptome. However, due to the complexity of dealing with isoforms, the scientific community has not sufficiently exploited this valuable resource in precision medicine. Findings: We present TranscriptAchilles, the first large-scale tool to predict transcript biomarkers associated with gene essentiality in cancer. This application integrates 412 loss-of-function RNA interference screens of >17,000 genes, together with their corresponding whole-transcriptome expression profiling. Using this tool, we have studied which are the cancer subtypes for which alternative splicing plays a significant role to state gene essentiality. In addition, we include a case study of renal cell carcinoma that shows the biological soundness of the results. The databases, the source code, and a guide to build the platform within a Docker container are available at GitLab. The application is also available online.

This often-destructive method is not suitable for studying mold fossils, which are voids left in host rocks due to dissolution of the original organism in post-depositional processes. Findings: Microcomputed tomography (μCT) scan data of 24 fossiliferous rock samples revealed thousands of Paleozoic echinoderms. Digitally”stitching” together individually μCT scanned rock samples within three-dimensional (3D) space allows for quantifiable taphonomic data on a fossil echinoderm-rich obrution deposit from the Devonian (Emsian) of South Africa. Here, we provide a brief step-by-step guide on creating, segmenting, and ultimately combining sections of richly fossiliferous beds to create virtual models suited for the quantitative and qualitative taphonomic analyses of fossil invertebrate assemblages. Conclusions: Visualizing the internal features of fossiliferous beds in 3D is an invaluable taphonomic tool for analyzing delicate fossils, accounting for all specimens irrespective of their preservation stages and with minimal damage. This technique is particularly useful for analyzing fossiliferous deposits with mold fossils that prove to be difficult to study with traditional methods, because the method relies on the large density contrast between the mold and host rock. © The Author(s) 2018.

However, in the field these stresses usually occur together because reduced transpirational cooling under drought conditions results in increased plant tissue temperature. In addition, environmental stresses are usually transient and the ability to efficiently recover from stress may be at least as important for overall stress tolerance as the direct stress response itself. Nevertheless, nothing is known about recovery mechanisms after drought and heat stress in rice under field conditions. Results: We have used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to elucidate the metabolic responses of flag leaves, flowering spikelets, and developing seeds from 3 rice cultivars differing in their drought and heat tolerance to rewatering after stress in the field. Within 60 hours after rewatering, many stress-responsive metabolites returned to their control levels, although recovery was not complete. In addition, control plants showed developmental differences that were revealed by metabolite profiles during 60 hours of post-stress sampling, in particular in developing seeds. Correlation analysis identified several metabolites as marker candidates for the stability of grain yield or quality under conditions of combined drought and heat stress. Conclusions: The rewatering responses of stressed plants seemed to be a combination of the reversal of stress effects and reinitiation of development after stress relief. The identified potential markers can be useful in efforts to breed stress-tolerant rice germplasm to ensure food availability under changing climate conditions. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

By exploiting next-generation sequencing technology, the QTL mapping accuracy can be improved significantly, providing a valuable means to annotate new genetic variants.

Single-cell sequencing applications have spread from conventional RNA sequencing to epigenomics, e.g., ATAC-seq. Many related algorithms and tools have been developed, but few computational workflows provide analysis flexibility while also achieving functional (i.e., information about the data and the tools used are saved as metadata) and computational reproducibility (i.e., a real image of the computational environment used to generate the data is stored) through a user-friendly environment. Findings: rCASC is a modular workflow providing an integrated analysis environment (from count generation to cell subpopulation identification) exploiting Docker containerization to achieve both functional and computational reproducibility in data analysis. Hence, rCASC provides preprocessing tools to remove low-quality cells and/or specific bias, e.g., cell cycle. Subpopulation discovery can instead be achieved using different clustering techniques based on different distance metrics. Cluster quality is then estimated through the new metric ""cell stability score"" (CSS), which describes the stability of a cell in a cluster as a consequence of a perturbation induced by removing a random set of cells from the cell population. CSS provides better cluster robustness information than the silhouette metric. Moreover, rCASC's tools can identify cluster-specific gene signatures. Conclusions: rCASC is a modular workflow with new features that could help researchers define cell subpopulations and detect subpopulation-specific markers. It uses Docker for ease of installation and to achieve a computation-reproducible analysis. A Java GUI is provided to welcome users without computational skills in R. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

It was included in a programme for rescuing the most threatened species in China, focusing on ""plant species with extremely small populations (PSESP)"". Findings: We generated 64, 94, and 110 Gb of raw DNA sequences and obtained a chromosome-level genome assembly of A. yangbiense through a combination of Pacific Biosciences Single-molecule Real-time, Illumina HiSeq X, and Hi-C mapping, respectively. The final genome assembly is ∼666 Mb, with 13 chromosomes covering ∼97% of the genome and scaffold N50 sizes of 45 Mb. Further, BUSCO analysis recovered 95.5% complete BUSCO genes. The total number of repetitive elements account for 68.0% of the A. yangbiense genome. Genome annotation generated 28,320 protein-coding genes, assisted by a combination of prediction and transcriptome sequencing. In addition, a nearly 1:1 orthology ratio of dot plots of longer syntenic blocks revealed a similar evolutionary history between A. yangbiense and grape, indicating that the genome has not undergone a whole-genome duplication event after the core eudicot common hexaploidization.

Our workflow utilizes tools and platforms used for development and distribution of successive versions of an open source software program, including version control, GitHub, and semantic versioning, and applies these to the analogous process of developing successive versions of an open source dataset.

The eastern yellow robin (EYR) is an endemic Australian songbird inferred to have experienced climate-driven sex-biased selection and is a prominent model for studying mitochondrial-nuclear interactions in the wild. However, the lack of an EYR reference genome containing both sex chromosomes (in birds, a female bearing Z and W chromosomes) limits efforts to understand the mechanisms of these processes. Here, we assemble the genome for a female EYR and use low-depth (10×) genome resequencing data from 19 individuals of known sex to identify chromosome fragments with sex-specific inheritance. Findings: MaSuRCA hybrid assembly using Nanopore and Illumina reads generated a 1.22-Gb EYR genome in 20,702 scaffolds (94.2% BUSCO completeness). Scaffolds were tested for W-linked (female-only) inheritance using a k-mer approach, and for Z-linked inheritance using median read-depth test in male and female reads (read-depths must indicate haploid female and diploid male representation). This resulted in 2,372 W-linked scaffolds (total length: 97,872,282 bp, N50: 81,931 bp) and 586 Z-linked scaffolds (total length: 121,817,358 bp, N50: 551,641 bp). Anchoring of the sex-linked EYR scaffolds to the reference genome of a female zebra finch revealed 2 categories of sex-linked genomic regions. First, 653 W-linked scaffolds (25.7 Mb) were anchored to the W sex chromosome and 215 Z-linked scaffolds (74.4 Mb) to the Z. Second, 1,138 W-linked scaffolds (70.9 Mb) and 179 Z-linked scaffolds (51.0 Mb) were anchored to a large section (coordinates ∼5 to ∼60 Mb) of zebra finch chromosome 1A. The first ∼5 Mb and last ∼14 Mb of the reference chromosome 1A had only autosomally behaving EYR scaffolds mapping to them. Conclusions: We report a female (W chromosome-containing) EYR genome and provide genomic evidence for a neo-sex (neo-W and neo-Z) chromosome system in the EYR, involving most of a large chromosome (1A) previously only reported to be autosomal in passerines. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Efforts to study their population genetics, breeding, cultivation, and stock enrichment have been somewhat hindered by the lack of a reference genome. Herein, we report the complete genome sequence of S. broughtonii, a first reference genome of the family Arcidae. Findings: A total of 75.79 Gb clean data were generated with the Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore platforms, which represented approximately 86× coverage of the S. broughtonii genome. De novo assembly of these long reads resulted in an 884.5-Mb genome, with a contig N50 of 1.80 Mb and scaffold N50 of 45.00 Mb. Genome Hi-C scaffolding resulted in 19 chromosomes containing 99.35% of bases in the assembled genome. Genome annotation revealed that nearly half of the genome (46.1%) is composed of repeated sequences, while 24,045 protein-coding genes were predicted and 84.7% of them were annotated. Conclusions: We report here a chromosomal-level assembly of the S. broughtonii genome based on long-read sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding. The genomic data can serve as a reference for the family Arcidae and will provide a valuable resource for the scientific community and aquaculture sector. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Substantial efforts are now devoted to biobank projects to collect large genetic and phenotypic data, providing unprecedented opportunity for genetic discovery and applications. To process the large-scale data provided by such biobank resources, highly efficient and scalable methods and software are required. Results: Here we introduce PRSice-2, an efficient and scalable software program for automating and simplifying PRS analyses on large-scale data. PRSice-2 handles both genotyped and imputed data, provides empirical association P-values free from inflation due to overfitting, supports different inheritance models, and can evaluate multiple continuous and binary target traits simultaneously. We demonstrate that PRSice-2 is dramatically faster and more memory-efficient than PRSice-1 and alternative PRS software, LDpred and lassosum, while having comparable predictive power. Conclusion: PRSice-2's combination of efficiency and power will be increasingly important as data sizes grow and as the applications of PRS become more sophisticated, e.g., when incorporated into high-dimensional or gene set-based analyses.

Remarkably, almost nothing is known about the genomics of this iconic radiation. There are 41 species in 16 genera currently recognized within the birds-of-paradise family (Paradisaeidae), most of which are endemic to the island of New Guinea. In this study, we sequenced genomes of representatives from all five major clades within this family to characterize genomic changes that may have played a role in the evolution of the group’s extensive phenotypic diversity. We found genes important for coloration, morphology, and feather and eye development to be under positive selection. In birds-of-paradise with complex lekking systems and strong sexual dimorphism, the core birds-of-paradise, we found Gene Ontology categories for “startle response” and “olfactory receptor activity” to be enriched among the gene families expanding significantly faster compared to the other birds in our study. Furthermore, we found novel families of retrovirus-like retrotransposons active in all three de novo genomes since the early diversification of the birds-of-paradise group, which might have played a role in the evolution of this fascinating group of birds. © The Author(s) 2019.

They are important foundation species that create coral ""forests,"" which provide unique niches and 3-dimensional living space for other organisms. The octocoral genus Renilla inhabits sandy, continental shelves in the subtropical and tropical Atlantic and eastern Pacific Oceans. Renilla is especially interesting because it produces secondary metabolites for defense, exhibits bioluminescence, and produces a luciferase that is widely used in dual-reporter assays in molecular biology. Although several anthozoan genomes are currently available, the majority of these are hexacorals. Here, we present a de novo assembly of an azooxanthellate shallow-water octocoral, Renilla muelleri. Findings: We generated a hybrid de novo assembly using MaSuRCA v.3.2.6. The final assembly included 4,825 scaffolds and a haploid genome size of 172 megabases (Mb). A BUSCO assessment found 88% of metazoan orthologs present in the genome. An Augustus ab initio gene prediction found 23,660 genes, of which 66% (15,635) had detectable similarity to annotated genes from the starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, or to the Uniprot database. Although the R. muelleri genome may be smaller (172 Mb minimum size) than other publicly available coral genomes (256-448 Mb), the R. muelleri genome is similar to other coral genomes in terms of the number of complete metazoan BUSCOs and predicted gene models. Conclusions: The R. muelleri hybrid genome provides a novel resource for researchers to investigate the evolution of genes and gene families within Octocorallia and more widely across Anthozoa. It will be a key resource for future comparative genomics with other corals and for understanding the genomic basis of coral diversity. © The Author(s) 2019.

Results: For the Illumina workflow, the time from DNA extraction to availability of results was ∼40 hours, whereas with the ONT workflow serotyping and Shiga toxin subtyping variant identification were available within 7 hours. After optimization of the ONT variant filtering, on average 95% of the discrepant positions between the technologies were accounted for by methylated positions found in the described 5-methylcytosine motif sequences, CC(A/T)GG. Of the few discrepant variants (6 and 7 difference for the 2 isolates) identified by the 2 technologies, it is likely that both methodologies contain false calls. Conclusions: Despite these discrepancies, Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technology sequences from the same case were placed on the same phylogenetic location against a dense reference database of STEC O157:H7 genomes sequenced using the Illumina workflow. Robust single-nucleotide polymorphism typing using MinION-based variant calling is possible, and we provide evidence that the 2 technologies can be used interchangeably to type STEC O157:H7 in a public health setting. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

With its extreme size and height, the giraffe's unique anatomical and physiological adaptations have long been of interest to diverse research fields. Giraffes are also critical to ecosystems of sub-Saharan Africa, with their long neck serving as a conduit to food sources not shared by other herbivores. Although the genome of a Masai giraffe has been sequenced, the assembly was highly fragmented and suboptimal for genome analysis. Herein we report an improved giraffe genome assembly to facilitate evolutionary analysis of the giraffe and other ruminant genomes. Findings: Using SOAPdenovo2 and 170 Gbp of Illumina paired-end and mate-pair reads, we generated a 2.6-Gbp male Masai giraffe genome assembly, with a scaffold N50 of 3 Mbp. The incorporation of 114.6 Gbp of Chicago library sequencing data resulted in a HiRise SOAPdenovo + Chicago assembly with an N50 of 48 Mbp and containing 95% of expected genes according to BUSCO analysis. Using the Reference-Assisted Chromosome Assembly tool, we were able to order and orient scaffolds into 42 predicted chromosome fragments (PCFs). Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we placed 153 cattle bacterial artificial chromosomes onto giraffe metaphase spreads to assess and assign the PCFs on 14 giraffe autosomes and the X chromosome resulting in the final assembly with an N50 of 177.94 Mbp. In this assembly, 21,621 protein-coding genes were identified using both de novo and homology-based predictions. Conclusions: We have produced the first chromosome-scale genome assembly for a Giraffidae species. This assembly provides a valuable resource for the study of artiodactyl evolution and for understanding the molecular basis of the unique adaptive traits of giraffes. In addition, the assembly will provide a powerful resource to assist conservation efforts of Masai giraffe, whose population size has declined by 52% in recent years. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

While reference-based tools are widely used in various transcriptomic studies, their application is limited to the organisms with finished and well-annotated genomes. De novo transcriptome reconstruction from short reads remains an open challenging problem, which is complicated by the varying expression levels across different genes, alternative splicing, and paralogous genes. Results: Herein we describe the novel transcriptome assembler rnaSPAdes, which has been developed on top of the SPAdes genome assembler and explores computational parallels between assembly of transcriptomes and single-cell genomes. We also present quality assessment reports for rnaSPAdes assemblies, compare it with modern transcriptome assembly tools using several evaluation approaches on various RNA-sequencing datasets, and briefly highlight strong and weak points of different assemblers. Conclusions: Based on the performed comparison between different assembly methods, we infer that it is not possible to detect the absolute leader according to all quality metrics and all used datasets. However, rnaSPAdes typically outperforms other assemblers by such important property as the number of assembled genes and isoforms, and at the same time has higher accuracy statistics on average comparing to the closest competitors. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

In particular, for beginners, the barrier to entry in bioinformatics software development is high, especially if they want to adopt good programming practices. Even experienced developers do not always follow best practices. This results in the proliferation of poorer-quality bioinformatics software, leading to limited scalability and inefficient use of resources; lack of reproducibility, usability, adaptability, and interoperability; and erroneous or inaccurate results. Findings: We have developed Bionitio, a tool that automates the process of starting new bioinformatics software projects following recommended best practices. With a single command, the user can create a new well-structured project in 1 of 12 programming languages. The resulting software is functional, carrying out a prototypical bioinformatics task, and thus serves as both a working example and a template for building new tools. Key features include command-line argument parsing, error handling, progress logging, defined exit status values, a test suite, a version number, standardized building and packaging, user documentation, code documentation, a standard open source software license, software revision control, and containerization. Conclusions: Bionitio serves as a learning aid for beginner-to-intermediate bioinformatics programmers and provides an excellent starting point for new projects. This helps developers adopt good programming practices from the beginning of a project and encourages high-quality tools to be developed more rapidly. This also benefits users because tools are more easily installed and consistent in their usage.

We present a co-designed lab workflow and bioinformatic pipeline to mitigate the 2 most important risks of environmental DNA use: sample contamination and taxonomic misassignment. These risks arise from the need for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to detect the trace amounts of DNA combined with the necessity of using short target regions due to DNA degradation. Findings: Our high-throughput workflow minimizes these risks via a 4-step strategy: (i) technical replication with 2 PCR replicates and 2 extraction replicates; (ii) using multi-markers (12S,16S,CytB); (iii) a ""twin-tagging,"" 2-step PCR protocol; and (iv) use of the probabilistic taxonomic assignment method PROTAX, which can account for incomplete reference databases. Because annotation errors in the reference sequences can result in taxonomic misassignment, we supply a protocol for curating sequence datasets. For some taxonomic groups and some markers, curation resulted in >50% of sequences being deleted from public reference databases, owing to (i) limited overlap between our target amplicon and reference sequences, (ii) mislabelling of reference sequences, and (iii) redundancy. Finally, we provide a bioinformatic pipeline to process amplicons and conduct PROTAX assignment and tested it on an invertebrate-derived DNA dataset from 1,532 leeches from Sabah, Malaysia. Twin-tagging allowed us to detect and exclude sequences with non-matching tags. The smallest DNA fragment (16S) amplified most frequently for all samples but was less powerful for discriminating at species rank. Using a stringent and lax acceptance criterion we found 162 (stringent) and 190 (lax) vertebrate detections of 95 (stringent) and 109 (lax) leech samples. Conclusions: Our metabarcoding workflow should help research groups increase the robustness of their results and therefore facilitate wider use of environmental and invertebrate-derived DNA, which is turning into a valuable source of ecological and conservation information on tetrapods. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

A handful of kiwifruit species have been domesticated, among which Actinidia eriantha is increasingly favored in breeding owing to its superior commercial traits. Recently, elite cultivars from A. eriantha have been successfully selected and further studies on their biology and breeding potential require genomic information, which is currently unavailable. Findings: We assembled a chromosome-scale genome sequence of A. eriantha cultivar White using single-molecular sequencing and chromatin interaction map-based scaffolding. The assembly has a total size of 690.6 megabases and an N50 of 21.7 megabases. Approximately 99% of the assembly were in 29 pseudomolecules corresponding to the 29 kiwifruit chromosomes. Forty-three percent of the A. eriantha genome are repetitive sequences, and the non-repetitive part encodes 42,988 protein-coding genes, of which 39,075 have homologues from other plant species or protein domains. The divergence time between A. eriantha and its close relative Actinidia chinensis is estimated to be 3.3 million years, and after diversification, 1,727 and 1,506 gene families are expanded and contracted in A. eriantha, respectively. Conclusions: We provide a high-quality reference genome for kiwifruit A. eriantha. This chromosome-scale genome assembly is substantially better than 2 published kiwifruit assemblies from A. chinensis in terms of genome contiguity and completeness. The availability of the A. eriantha genome provides a valuable resource for facilitating kiwifruit breeding and studies of kiwifruit biology. © The Author(s) 2019.

However, the genome information for this species has not yet to be sequenced and published. Here, we analyzed the entire genome of a parthenogenetic female aphid colony using Pacific Biosciences long-read sequencing and Hi-C data to generate chromosome-length scaffolds and a highly contiguous genome assembly. Results: The final draft genome assembly from 33.88 Gb of raw data was ∼397.90 Mb in size, with a 2.05 Mb contig N50. Nine chromosomes were further assembled based on Hi-C data to a 377.19 Mb final size with a 36.26 Mb scaffold N50. The identified repeat sequences accounted for 26.41% of the genome, and 16,006 protein-coding genes were annotated. According to the phylogenetic analysis, S. miscanthi is closely related to Acyrthosiphon pisum, with S. miscanthi diverging from their common ancestor ∼25.0-44.9 million years ago. Conclusions: We generated a high-quality draft of the S. miscanthi genome. This genome assembly should help promote research on the lifestyle and feeding specificity of aphids and their interactions with each other and species at other trophic levels. It can serve as a resource for accelerating genome-assisted improvements in insecticide-resistant management and environmentally safe aphid management. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

While the technology has brought with it better transcript coverage and quantification, there remain considerable barriers to entry for the computational biologist to analyse large data sets. There is a real need for a repository of uniformly processed RNA-seq data that is easy to use. Findings: To address these obstacles, we developed Digital Expression Explorer 2 (DEE2), a web-based repository of RNA-seq data in the form of gene-level and transcript-level expression counts. DEE2 contains >5.3 trillion assigned reads from 580,000 RNA-seq data sets including species Escherichia coli, yeast, Arabidopsis, worm, fruit fly, zebrafish, rat, mouse, and human. Base-space sequence data downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive underwent quality control prior to transcriptome and genome mapping using open-source tools. Uniform data processing methods ensure consistency across experiments, facilitating fast and reproducible meta-analyses. Conclusions: The web interface allows users to quickly identify data sets of interest using accession number and keyword searches. The data can also be accessed programmatically using a specifically designed R package. We demonstrate that DEE2 data are compatible with statistical packages such as edgeR or DESeq.

The bottom-dwelling Eocene ancestor of Antarctic notothenioid fishes survived polar marine glaciation and underwent adaptive radiation, forming >120 species that fill all water column niches today. Genome-wide changes enabling physiological adaptations and the rapid expansion of the Antarctic notothenioids remain poorly understood. Results: We sequenced and compared 2 notothenioid genomes - the cold-adapted and neutrally buoyant Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni and the basal Patagonian robalo Eleginops maclovinus, representing the temperate ancestor. We detected >200 protein gene families that had expanded and thousands of genes that had evolved faster in the toothfish, with diverse cold-relevant functions including stress response, lipid metabolism, protein homeostasis, and freeze resistance. Besides antifreeze glycoprotein, an eggshell protein had functionally diversified to aid in cellular freezing resistance. Genomic and transcriptomic comparisons revealed proliferation of selcys-transfer RNA genes and broad transcriptional upregulation across anti-oxidative selenoproteins, signifying their prominent role in mitigating oxidative stress in the oxygen-rich Southern Ocean. We found expansion of transposable elements, temporally correlated to Antarctic notothenioid diversification. Additionally, the toothfish exhibited remarkable shifts in genetic programs towards enhanced fat cell differentiation and lipid storage, and promotion of chondrogenesis while inhibiting osteogenesis in bone development, collectively contributing to the achievement of neutral buoyancy and pelagicism. Conclusions: Our study revealed a comprehensive landscape of evolutionary changes essential for Antarctic notothenioid cold adaptation and ecological expansion. The 2 genomes are valuable resources for further exploration of mechanisms underlying the spectacular notothenioid radiation in the coldest marine environment. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Although a genome assembly for R. roxellana is available, it is incomplete and fragmented because it was constructed using short-read sequencing technology. Thus, important information such as genome structural variation and repeat sequences may be absent. Findings: To obtain a high-quality chromosomal assembly for R. roxellana qinlingensis, we used 5 methods: Pacific Bioscience single-molecule real-time sequencing, Illumina paired-end sequencing, BioNano optical maps, 10X Genomics link-reads, and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture. The assembled genome was ∼3.04 Gb, with a contig N50 of 5.72 Mb and a scaffold N50 of 144.56 Mb. This represented a 100-fold improvement over the previously published genome. In the new genome, 22,497 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 22,053 were functionally annotated. Gene family analysis showed that 993 and 2,745 gene families were expanded and contracted, respectively. The reconstructed phylogeny recovered a close relationship between R. rollexana and Macaca mulatta, and these 2 species diverged ∼13.4 million years ago. Conclusion: We constructed a high-quality genome assembly of the Qinling golden snub-nosed monkey; it had superior continuity and accuracy, which might be useful for future genetic studies in this species and as a new standard reference genome for colobine primates.

Despite the prevalence of transcriptomic studies, the effects of using different workflows, or ""pipelines,"" on the resulting assemblies are poorly understood. Here, a pipeline was programmatically automated and used to assemble and annotate raw transcriptomic short-read data collected as part of the Marine Microbial Eukaryotic Transcriptome Sequencing Project. The resulting transcriptome assemblies were evaluated and compared against assemblies that were previously generated with a different pipeline developed by the National Center for Genome Research. Results: New transcriptome assemblies contained the majority of previous contigs as well as new content. On average, 7.8% of the annotated contigs in the new assemblies were novel gene names not found in the previous assemblies. Taxonomic trends were observed in the assembly metrics. Assemblies from the Dinoflagellata showed a higher number of contigs and unique k-mers than transcriptomes from other phyla, while assemblies from Ciliophora had a lower percentage of open reading frames compared to other phyla. Conclusions: Given current bioinformatics approaches, there is no single ""best"" reference transcriptome for a particular set of raw data. As the optimum transcriptome is a moving target, improving (or not) with new tools and approaches, automated and programmable pipelines are invaluable for managing the computationally intensive tasks required for re-processing large sets of samples with revised pipelines and ensuring a common evaluation workflow is applied to all samples. Thus, re-assembling existing data with new tools using automated and programmable pipelines may yield more accurate identification of taxon-specific trends across samples in addition to novel and useful products for the community. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

In African trypanosomes, hemoparasites of humans and animals, this is complicated by variant antigen repertoires containing hundreds of genes subject to various degrees of sequence recombination. Findings: We introduce Variant Antigen Profiler (VAPPER), a tool that allows automated analysis of the variant surface glycoprotein repertoires of the most prevalent livestock African trypanosomes. VAPPER produces variant antigen profiles for any isolate of the veterinary pathogens Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax from genomic and transcriptomic sequencing data and delivers publication-ready figures that show how the queried isolate compares with a database of existing strains. VAPPER is implemented in Python. It can be installed to a local Galaxy instance from the ToolShed (https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/) or locally on a Linux platform via the command line (https://github.com/PGB-LIV/VAPPER). The documentation, requirements, examples, and test data are provided in the Github repository. Conclusion: By establishing two different, yet comparable methodologies, our approach is the first to allow large-scale analysis of African trypanosome variant antigens, large multi-copy gene families that are otherwise refractory to high-throughput analysis. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Monitoring studies of sardine populations report an alarming decrease in stocks due to overfishing and environmental change, which has resulted in historically low captures along the Iberian Atlantic coast. Important biological and ecological features such as population diversity, structure, and migratory patterns can be addressed with the development and use of genomics resources. Findings: The genome of a single female individual was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq X Ten 10x Genomics linked reads, generating 113.8 gigabase pairs of data. Three draft genomes were assembled: 2 haploid genomes with a total size of 935 megabase pairs (N50 103 kilobase pairs) each, and a consensus genome of total size 950 megabase pairs (N50 97 kilobase pairs). The genome completeness assessment captured 84% of Actinopterygii Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs. To obtain a more complete analysis, the transcriptomes of 11 tissues were sequenced to aid the functional annotation of the genome, resulting in 40,777 genes predicted. Variant calling on nearly half of the haplotype genome resulted in the identification of >2.3 million phased single-nucleotide polymorphisms with heterozygous loci. Conclusions: A draft genome was obtained, despite a high level of sequence repeats and heterozygosity, which are expected genome characteristics of a wild sardine. The reference sardine genome and respective variant data will be a cornerstone resource of ongoing population genomics studies to be integrated into future sardine stock assessment modelling to better manage this valuable resource. © The Author(s) 2019.

However, under field conditions, these 2 stresses rarely occur separately. Under well-watered conditions, plants avoid heat stress by transpirational cooling, while this is not possible under drought conditions. Although investigating combined drought and heat stress is clearly more agronomically relevant than analyzing the effects of the single stresses, only a few studies of this stress combination, in particular under field conditions, have been published. Results: Three rice cultivars differing in drought and heat tolerance were grown in the field under control and drought conditions in 3 consecutive years. Drought was applied either during flowering or during early grain filling and resulted in simultaneous heat stress, leading to reduced grain yield and quality. Analysis by gas chromatography−mass spectrometry showed distinct metabolic profiles for the 3 investigated organs (flag leaves, flowering spikelets, developing seeds). The metabolic stress responses of the plants also strongly differed between cultivars and organs. Correlation analysis identified potential metabolic markers for grain yield and quality under combined drought and heat stress from both stress-regulated metabolites and from metabolites with constitutive differences between the cultivars. Conclusions: Gas chromatography−mass spectrometry resolved metabolic responses to combined drought and heat stress in different organs of field-grown rice. The metabolite profiles can be used to identify potential marker metabolites for yield stability and grain quality that are expected to improve breeding efforts towards developing rice cultivars that are resilient to climate change. © The Author(s) 2019.

Findings: ascend is an R package comprising tools designed to simplify and streamline the preliminary analysis of scRNA-seq data, while addressing the statistical challenges of scRNA-seq analysis and enabling flexible integration with genomics packages and native R functions, including fast parallel computation and efficient memory management. The package incorporates both novel and established methods to provide a framework to perform cell and gene filtering, quality control, normalization, dimension reduction, clustering, differential expression, and a wide range of visualization functions. Conclusions: ascend is designed to work with scRNA-seq data generated by any high-throughput platform and includes functions to convert data objects between software packages.

However, the lack of a high-quality reference genome has hindered the association of phenotypic traits with their genetic basis in this important mosquito. Findings: Here we present a new high-quality A. funestus reference genome (AfunF3) assembled using 240?coverage of long-read single-molecule sequencing for contigging, combined with 100× coverage of short-read Hi-C data for chromosome scaffolding. The assembled contigs total 446 Mbp of sequence and contain substantial duplication due to alternative alleles present in the sequenced pool of mosquitos from the FUMOZ colony. Using alignment and depth-of-coverage information, these contigs were deduplicated to a 211 Mbp primary assembly, which is closer to the expected haploid genome size of 250 Mbp. This primary assembly consists of 1,053 contigs organized into 3 chromosome-scale scaffolds with an N50 contig size of 632 kbp and an N50 scaffold size of 93.811 Mbp, representing a 100-fold improvement in continuity versus the current reference assembly, AfunF1.

The discovery of SVs based on short DNA sequence reads from next-generation DNA sequence methods is error-prone, with low sensitivity and high false discovery rates. These shortcomings can be partially overcome with extensive orthogonal validation methods or use of long reads, but the current cost precludes their application for routine clinical diagnostics. In contrast, SV genotyping of known sites of SV occurrence is relatively robust and therefore offers a cost-effective clinical diagnostic tool with potentially few false-positive and false-negative results, even when applied to short-read DNA sequence data. Results: We assess 5 state-of-the-art SV genotyping software methods, applied to short-read sequence data. The methods are characterized on the basis of their ability to genotype different SV types, spanning different size ranges. Furthermore, we analyze their ability to parse different VCF file subformats and assess their reliance on specific metadata. We compare the SV genotyping methods across a range of simulated and real data including SVs that were not found with Illumina data alone. We assess sensitivity and the ability to filter initial false discovery calls. We determined the impact of SV type and size on the performance for each SV genotyper.

Cucumber is an important vegetable crop and model system for sex determination and vascular biology. Low-coverage Sanger sequences and high-coverage short Illumina sequences have been used to assemble draft cucumber genomes, but the incompleteness and low quality of these genomes limit their use in comparative genomics and genetic research. A high-quality and complete cucumber genome assembly is therefore essential. Findings: We assembled single-molecule real-time (SMRT) long reads to generate an improved cucumber reference genome. This version contains 174 contigs with a total length of 226.2 Mb and an N50 of 8.9 Mb, and provides 29.0 Mb more sequence data than previous versions. Using 10X Genomics and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data, 89 contigs (∼211.0 Mb) were directly linked into 7 pseudo-chromosome sequences. The newly assembled regions show much higher guanine-cytosine or adenine-thymine content than found previously, which is likely to have been inaccessible to Illumina sequencing. The new assembly contains 1,374 full-length long terminal retrotransposons and 1,078 novel genes including 239 tandemly duplicated genes. For example, we found 4 tandemly duplicated tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases, in contrast to the single copy of the gene found previously and in most other plants. Conclusion: This high-quality genome presents novel features of the cucumber genome and will serve as a valuable resource for genetic research in cucumber and plant comparative genomics. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Where these surveillance traps have low specificity and capture non-target endemic species in excess of the target pests, the need for extensive specimen sorting and identification creates a major diagnostic bottleneck. While the recent development of standardized molecular diagnostics has partly alleviated this requirement, the single specimen per reaction nature of these methods does not readily scale to the sheer number of insects trapped in surveillance programmes. Consequently, target lists are often restricted to a few high-priority pests, allowing unanticipated species to avoid detection and potentially establish populations. DNA metabarcoding has recently emerged as a method for conducting simultaneous, multi-species identification of complex mixed communities and may lend itself ideally to rapid diagnostics of bulk insect trap samples. Moreover, the high-throughput nature of recent sequencing platforms could enable the multiplexing of hundreds of diverse trap samples on a single flow cell, thereby providing the means to dramatically scale up insect surveillance in terms of both the quantity of traps that can be processed concurrently and number of pest species that can be targeted. In this review of the metabarcoding literature, we explore how DNA metabarcoding could be tailored to the detection of invasive insects in a surveillance context and highlight the unique technical and regulatory challenges that must be considered when implementing high-throughput sequencing technologies into sensitive diagnostic applications. © The Author(s) 2019.","bioinformatics; biosurveillance; diagnostic test accuracy study; high throughput sequencing; insect; introduced species; nonhuman; pest organism; quality control; reference database; review; scale up; species identification; article; validation process","Oxford University Press","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070841263"

It is widely used in improving genome assemblies and detecting structural variations by providing information over much longer (up to 1 Mb) reads. Current standards in optical mapping analysis involve assembling optical maps into contigs and aligning them to a reference, which is limited to pairwise comparison and becomes bias-prone when analyzing multiple samples. Findings: We present a new method, OMMA, that extends optical mapping to the study of complex genomic features by simultaneously interrogating optical maps across many samples in a reference-independent manner. OMMA captures and characterizes complex genomic features, e.g., multiple haplotypes, copy number variations, and subtelomeric structures when applied to 154 human samples across the 26 populations sequenced in the 1000 Genomes Project. For small genomes such as pathogenic bacteria, OMMA accurately reconstructs the phylogenomic relationships and identifies functional elements across 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains. Conclusions: With the increasing data throughput of optical mapping system, the use of this technology in comparative genome analysis across many samples will become feasible.

Results: Although a reproducibility crisis is widely perceived, conclusive data on the scale of the problem and the underlying reasons are largely lacking. The debate is primarily focused on methodological issues. However, examples such as the use of misidentified cell lines illustrate that the availability of reliable methods does not guarantee good practice. Moreover, research is often characterized by a lack of established methods. Despite the crucial importance of researcher conduct, research and conclusive data on the determinants of researcher behavior are widely missing. Conclusion: Meta-research that establishes an understanding of the factors that determine researcher behavior is urgently needed.

The in situ mechanisms of these complexes are unclear because their 3D distribution, organization, and interactions are largely unknown. Electron cryotomography (cryo-ET) can address these knowledge gaps because it produces cryotomograms - 3D images that reveal biological structure at ∼4-nm resolution. Cryo-ET uses no fixation, dehydration, staining, or plastic embedment, so cellular features are visualized in a life-like, frozen-hydrated state. To study chromatin and mitotic machinery in situ, we subjected yeast cells to genetic and chemical perturbations, cryosectioned them, and then imaged the cells by cryo-ET. Findings: Here we share >1,000 cryo-ET raw datasets of cryosectioned budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaecollected as part of previously published studies. These data will be valuable to cell biologists who are interested in the nanoscale organization of yeasts and of eukaryotic cells in general. All the unpublished tilt series and a subset of corresponding cryotomograms have been deposited in the EMPIAR resource for the community to use freely. To improve tilt series discoverability, we have uploaded metadata and preliminary notes to publicly accessible Google Sheets, EMPIAR, and GigaDB. Conclusions: Cellular cryo-ET data can be mined to obtain new cell-biological, structural, and 3D statistical insights in situ. These data contain structures not visible in traditional electron-microscopy data. Template matching and subtomogram averaging of known macromolecular complexes can reveal their 3D distributions and low-resolution structures. Furthermore, these data can serve as testbeds for high-throughput image-analysis pipelines, as training sets for feature-recognition software, for feasibility analysis when planning new structural-cell-biology projects, and as practice data for students. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

However, such pitfalls as spurious identification of pathogens based on fragmentary data or environmental contamination could lead to incorrect epidaemiological conclusions. Within the Mycobacterium genus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex members responsible for tuberculosis share up to ∼99% genomic sequence identity, while other more distantly related Mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis can be causative agents for pulmonary diseases or soil dwellers. Therefore, reliable determination of species complex is crucial for interpretation of sequencing results. Results: Here we present a novel bioinformatical approach, used for screening of ancient tuberculosis in sequencing data, derived from 28 individuals (dated 4400-4000 and 3100-2900 BC) from central Poland. We demonstrate that cost-effective next-generation screening sequencing data (∼20M reads per sample) could yield enough information to provide statistically supported identification of probable ancient disease cases. Conclusions: Application of appropriate bioinformatic tools, including an unbiased selection of genomic alignment targets for species specificity, makes it possible to extract valid data from full-sample sequencing results (without subjective targeted enrichment procedures).

However, the processes that shape venom protein evolution are poorly understood because of the scarcity of whole-genome data available for comparative analyses of venomous species. Results: We performed a broad comparative toxicogenomic analysis to gain insight into the genomic mechanisms of venom evolution in robber flies (Asilidae). We first sequenced a high-quality draft genome of the hymenopteran hunting robber fly Dasypogon diadema, analysed its venom by a combined proteotranscriptomic approach, and compared our results with recently described robber fly venoms to assess the general composition and major components of asilid venom. We then applied a comparative genomics approach, based on 1 additional asilid genome, 10 high-quality dipteran genomes, and 2 lepidopteran outgroup genomes, to reveal the evolutionary mechanisms and origins of identified venom proteins in robber flies. Conclusions: While homologues were identified for 15 of 30 predominant venom protein in the non-asilid genomes, the remaining 15 highly expressed venom proteins appear to be unique to robber flies. Our results reveal that the venom of D. diadema likely evolves in a multimodal fashion comprising (i) neofunctionalization after gene duplication, (ii) expression-dependent co-option of proteins, and (iii) asilid lineage-specific orphan genes with enigmatic origin. The role of such orphan genes is currently being disputed in evolutionary genomics but has not been discussed in the context of toxin evolution. Our results display an unexpected dynamic venom evolution in asilid insects, which contrasts the findings of the only other insect toxicogenomic evolutionary analysis, in parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera), where toxin evolution is dominated by single gene co-option. These findings underpin the significance of further genomic studies to cover more neglected lineages of venomous taxa and to understand the importance of orphan genes as possible drivers for venom evolution. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Scientific workflow management systems simplify the assembly of such tools into pipelines, assist with job automation, and aid reproducibility of analyses. Many contemporary workflow tools are specialized or not designed for highly complex workflows, such as with nested loops, dynamic scheduling, and parametrization, which is common in, e.g., machine learning. Findings: SciPipe is a workflow programming library implemented in the programming language Go, for managing complex and dynamic pipelines in bioinformatics, cheminformatics, and other fields. SciPipe helps in particular with workflow constructs common in machine learning, such as extensive branching, parameter sweeps, and dynamic scheduling and parametrization of downstream tasks. SciPipe builds on flow-based programming principles to support agile development of workflows based on a library of self-contained, reusable components. It supports running subsets of workflows for improved iterative development and provides a data-centric audit logging feature that saves a full audit trace for every output file of a workflow, which can be converted to other formats such as HTML, TeX, and PDF on demand. The utility of SciPipe is demonstrated with a machine learning pipeline, a genomics, and a transcriptomics pipeline.

Although many multi-omics analysis methods have been developed for complex disease studies, only a few simulation tools that simulate multiple types of omics data and model their relationships with disease status are available, and these tools have their limitations in simulating the multi-omics data. Results: We developed the multi-omics data simulator OmicsSIMLA, which simulates genomics (i.e., single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] and copy number variations), epigenomics (i.e., bisulphite sequencing), transcriptomics (i.e., RNA sequencing), and proteomics (i.e., normalized reverse phase protein array) data at the whole-genome level. Furthermore, the relationships between different types of omics data, such as methylation quantitative trait loci (SNPs influencing methylation), expression quantitative trait loci (SNPs influencing gene expression), and expression quantitative trait methylations (methylations influencing gene expression), were modeled. More importantly, the relationships between these multi-omics data and the disease status were modeled as well. We used OmicsSIMLA to simulate a multi-omics dataset for breast cancer under a hypothetical disease model and used the data to compare the performance among existing multi-omics analysis methods in terms of disease classification accuracy and runtime. We also used OmicsSIMLA to simulate a multi-omics dataset with a scale similar to an ovarian cancer multi-omics dataset. The neural network–based multi-omics analysis method ATHENA was applied to both the real and simulated data and the results were compared. Our results demonstrated that complex disease mechanisms can be simulated by OmicsSIMLA, and ATHENA showed the highest prediction accuracy when the effects of multi-omics features (e.g., SNPs, copy number variations, and gene expression levels) on the disease were strong. Furthermore, similar results can be obtained from ATHENA when analyzing the simulated and real ovarian multi-omics data. Conclusions: OmicsSIMLA will be useful to evaluate the performace of different multi-omics analysis methods. Sample sizes and power can also be calculated by OmicsSIMLA when planning a new multi-omics disease study. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

With this potential wealth of data comes practical problems (e.g., how to merge data streams from various sources), as well as ethical problems (e.g., how best to balance risks and benefits when enabling personal data sharing by individuals). Results: To begin to address these problems in real time, we present Open Humans, a community-based platform that enables personal data collections across data streams, giving individuals more personal data access and control of sharing authorizations, and enabling academic research as well as patient-led projects. We showcase data streams that Open Humans combines (e.g., personal genetic data, wearable activity monitors, GPS location records, and continuous glucose monitor data), along with use cases of how the data facilitate various projects.

Recently, research on the insect's harmfulness to crops, usefulness in agricultural waste utilization, edibility, medicinal value, and usability in insect immunology has provided sufficient impetus to demonstrate the need for a detailed study of its biology. Herein, we sequenced the whole genome of this species to improve our understanding and study of P. brevitarsis. Findings: We developed a highly reliable genome resource for P. brevitarsis (Lewis, 1879; Coleoptera: Cetoniinae) using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms. A total of 135.75 gigabases (Gb) was generated, providing 150-fold coverage based on the 810-megabases (Mb) estimated genome size. The assembled P. brevitarsis genome was 751 Mb (including the scaffolds longer than 2 kilobases (kb)) with 327 scaffolds, and the N50 length of the assembly was 2.94 Mb. A total of 34,110 (22,229 in scaffolds and 11,881 located in alleles) genes were identified using Evidence Modeler, which was based on the gene prediction results obtained from 3 different methods (ab initio, RNA sequencing based, and known gene based).

Here we compare multiple, high-quality, chromosome-scale genome assemblies to elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying cichlid diversification and study how genome structure evolves in rapidly radiating lineages. Results: We re-anchored our recent assembly of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) genome using a new high-density genetic map. We also developed a new de novo genome assembly of the Lake Malawi cichlid, Metriaclima zebra, using high-coverage Pacific Biosciences sequencing, and anchored contigs to linkage groups (LGs) using 4 different genetic maps. These new anchored assemblies allow the first chromosome-scale comparisons of African cichlid genomes. Large intra-chromosomal structural differences (∼2-28 megabase pairs) among species are common, while inter-chromosomal differences are rare (<10 megabase pairs total). Placement of the centromeres within the chromosome-scale assemblies identifies large structural differences that explain many of the karyotype differences among species. Structural differences are also associated with unique patterns of recombination on sex chromosomes. Structural differences on LG9, LG11, and LG20 are associated with reduced recombination, indicative of inversions between the rock- and sand-dwelling clades of Lake Malawi cichlids. M. zebra has a larger number of recent transposable element insertions compared with O. niloticus, suggesting that several transposable element families have a higher rate of insertion in the haplochromine cichlid lineage. Conclusion: This study identifies novel structural variation among East African cichlid genomes and provides a new set of genomic resources to support research on the mechanisms driving cichlid adaptation and speciation. © The Author(s) 2019.

Biclustering algorithms that perform local clustering on subsets of genes and conditions help address this problem. We propose a graph-based Tunable Biclustering Algorithm (TuBA) based on a novel pairwise proximity measure, examining the relationship of samples at the extremes of genes' expression profiles to identify similarly altered signatures. Results: TuBA's predictions are consistent in 3,940 breast invasive carcinoma samples from 3 independent sources, using different technologies for measuring gene expression (RNA sequencing and Microarray). More than 60% of biclusters identified independently in each dataset had significant agreement in their gene sets, as well as similar clinical implications. Approximately 50% of biclusters were enriched in the estrogen receptor-negative/HER2-negative (or basal-like) subtype, while >50% were associated with transcriptionally active copy number changes. Biclusters representing gene co-expression patterns in stromal tissue were also identified in tumor specimens. Conclusions: TuBA offers a simple biclustering method that can identify biologically relevant gene co-expression signatures not captured by traditional unsupervised clustering approaches. It complements biclustering approaches that are designed to identify constant or coherent submatrices in gene expression datasets, and outperforms them in identifying a multitude of altered transcriptional profiles that are associated with observed genomic heterogeneity of diseased states in breast cancer, both within and across tumor subtypes, a promising step in understanding disease heterogeneity, and a necessary first step in individualized therapy. © 2019 The Author(s).

A pseudomolecule-level genome assembly for this species will not only contribute to understanding the evolution of its genes and chromosomes but also bring yellowhorn breeding into the genomic era. Findings: Here, we generated 15 pseudomolecules of yellowhorn chromosomes, on which 97.04% of scaffolds were anchored, using the combined Illumina HiSeq, Pacific Biosciences Sequel, and Hi-C technologies. The length of the final yellowhorn genome assembly was 504.2 Mb with a contig N50 size of 1.04 Mb and a scaffold N50 size of 32.17 Mb. Genome annotation revealed that 68.67% of the yellowhorn genome was composed of repetitive elements. Gene modelling predicted 24,672 protein-coding genes. By comparing orthologous genes, the divergence time of yellowhorn and its close sister species longan (Dimocarpus longan) was estimated at ∼33.07 million years ago. Gene cluster and chromosome synteny analysis demonstrated that the yellowhorn genome shared a conserved genome structure with its ancestor in some chromosomes. Conclusions: This genome assembly represents a high-quality reference genome for yellowhorn. Integrated genome annotations provide a valuable dataset for genetic and molecular research in this species. We did not detect whole-genome duplication in the genome. The yellowhorn genome carries syntenic blocks from ancient chromosomes.

Similar sequence content can confound the mapping of short next-generation sequencing reads to a reference genome. It is therefore possible that the presence of both sex chromosomes in a reference genome can cause technical artifacts in genomic data and affect downstream analyses and applications. Understanding this problem is critical for medical genomics and population genomic inference. Results: Here, we characterize how sequence homology can affect analyses on the sex chromosomes and present XYalign, a new tool that (1) facilitates the inference of sex chromosome complement from next-generation sequencing data; (2) corrects erroneous read mapping on the sex chromosomes; and (3) tabulates and visualizes important metrics for quality control such as mapping quality, sequencing depth, and allele balance. We find that sequence homology affects read mapping on the sex chromosomes and this has downstream effects on variant calling. However, we show that XYalign can correct mismapping, resulting in more accurate variant calling. We also show how metrics output by XYalign can be used to identify XX and XY individuals across diverse sequencing experiments, including low- and high-coverage whole-genome sequencing, and exome sequencing. Finally, we discuss how the flexibility of the XYalign framework can be leveraged for other uses including the identification of aneuploidy on the autosomes. XYalign is available open source under the GNU General Public License (version 3). Conclusions: Sex chromsome sequence homology causes the mismapping of short reads, which in turn affects downstream analyses. XYalign provides a reproducible framework to correct mismapping and improve variant calling on the sex chromsomes. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Machine learning models used to screen for patients at risk of progression to dementia should therefore favor specificity (detecting only progressors) over sensitivity (detecting all progressors), especially when the prevalence of progressors is low. Here, we explore whether such high-risk patients can be identified using cognitive assessments and structural neuroimaging by training machine learning tools in a high-specificity regime. Results: A multimodal signature of Alzheimer’s dementia was first extracted from the ADNI1 dataset. We then validated the predictive value of this signature on ADNI1 patients with mild cognitive impairment (N = 235). The signature was optimized to predict progression to dementia over 3 years with low sensitivity (55.1%) but high specificity (95.6%), resulting in only moderate accuracy (69.3%) but high positive predictive value (80.4%, adjusted for a “typical” 33% prevalence rate of true progressors). These results were replicated in ADNI2 (N = 235), with 87.8% adjusted positive predictive value (96.7% specificity, 47.3% sensitivity, 85.1% accuracy). Conclusions: We found that cognitive measures alone could identify high-risk individuals, with structural measurements providing a slight improvement. The signature had comparable receiver operating characteristics to standard machine learning tools, yet a marked improvement in positive predictive value was achieved over the literature by selecting a high-specificity operating point. The multimodal signature can be readily applied for the enrichment of clinical trials. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

This provides potential insights about the cellular or physiological responses to chemical exposure and adverse effects, which is needed in assessment of chemical-related hazards or environmental health. In this regard, comparison or connection of different experiments becomes important when interpreting toxicogenomic experiments. Owing to lack of capturing response dynamics, comparability is often limited. In this study, we aim to overcome these constraints. Results: We developed an experimental design and bioinformatic analysis strategy to infer time-and concentration-resolved toxicogenomic fingerprints. We projected the fingerprints to a universal coordinate system (toxicogenomic universe) based on a self-organizing map of toxicogenomic data retrieved from public databases. Genes clustering together in regions of the map indicate functional relation due to co-expression under chemical exposure. To allow for quantitative description and extrapolation of the gene expression responses we developed a time-and concentration-dependent regression model. We applied the analysis strategy in a microarray case study exposing zebrafish embryos to 3 selected model compounds including 2 cyclooxygenase inhibitors. After identification of key responses in the transcriptome we could compare and characterize their association to developmental, toxicokinetic, and toxicodynamic processes using the parameter estimates for affected gene clusters. Furthermore, we discuss an association of toxicogenomic effects with measured internal concentrations. Conclusions: The design and analysis pipeline described here could serve as a blueprint for creating comparable toxicogenomic fingerprints of chemicals. It integrates, aggregates, and models time-and concentration-resolved toxicogenomic data. © 2019 The Author(s).","Animals; Computational Biology; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Models, Biological; Risk Assessment; Toxicogenetics; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; diclofenac; diuron; naproxen; transcriptome; Article; bioinformatics; case study; chemical fingerprinting; concentration response; experimental design; gene cluster; gene expression; microarray analysis; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; toxicogenetics; toxicogenomics; toxicokinetics; transcriptomics; adverse drug reaction; animal; biological model; biology; genetics; procedures; risk assessment; toxicogenetics; zebra fish","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067306435"

However, the metrics used to measure academic success, such as the number of publications, citation number, and impact factor, have not changed for decades. Moreover, recent studies indicate that these metrics have become targets and follow Goodhart's Law, according to which, ""when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."" Results In this study, we analyzed >120 million papers to examine how the academic publishing world has evolved over the last century, with a deeper look into the specific field of biology. Our study shows that the validity of citation-based measures is being compromised and their usefulness is lessening. In particular, the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric as a result of longer author lists, shorter papers, and surging publication numbers. Citation-based metrics, such citation number and h-index, are likewise affected by the flood of papers, self-citations, and lengthy reference lists. Measures such as a journal's impact factor have also ceased to be good metrics due to the soaring numbers of papers that are published in top journals, particularly from the same pool of authors. Moreover, by analyzing properties of >2,600 research fields, we observed that citation-based metrics are not beneficial for comparing researchers in different fields, or even in the same department. Conclusions Academic publishing has changed considerably; now we need to reconsider how we measure success. © 2019 The Author(s).","Benchmarking; Bibliometrics; Journal Impact Factor; article; big data; biology; data science; human; publishing; scientist; validity; benchmarking; bibliometrics; journal impact factor","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067287872"

An estimated 85% of H. pylori-colonized individuals experience no detrimental effects. To study the mechanisms promoting host tolerance to the bacterium in the gastrointestinal mucosa and systemic regulatory effects, we investigated the dynamics of immunoregulatory mechanisms triggered by H. pylori using a high-performance computing-driven ENteric Immunity SImulator multiscale model. Immune responses were simulated by integrating an agent-based model, ordinary, and partial differential equations. Results: The outputs were analyzed using 2 sequential stages: The first used a partial rank correlation coefficient regression-based and the second a metamodel-based global sensitivity analysis. The influential parameters screened from the first stage were selected to be varied for the second stage. The outputs from both stages were combined as a training dataset to build a spatiotemporal metamodel. The Sobol indices measured time-varying impact of input parameters during initiation, peak, and chronic phases of infection. The study identified epithelial cell proliferation and epithelial cell death as key parameters that control infection outcomes. In silico validation showed that colonization with H. pylori decreased with a decrease in epithelial cell proliferation, which was linked to regulatory macrophages and tolerogenic dendritic cells. Conclusions: The hybrid model of H. pylori infection identified epithelial cell proliferation as a key factor for successful colonization of the gastric niche and highlighted the role of tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory macrophages in modulating the host responses and shaping infection outcomes. © 2019 The Author(s).","Animals; Cell Proliferation; Computer Simulation; Epithelial Cells; Gastrointestinal Tract; Helicobacter Infections; Helicobacter pylori; Immune System; Mice; Models, Biological; Article; bacterial colonization; cell death; cell proliferation; controlled study; correlation coefficient; dendritic cell; epithelium cell; Helicobacter pylori; immune response; immunoregulation; intestine flora; lamina propria; macrophage; nonhuman; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; animal; biological model; computer simulation; gastrointestinal tract; Helicobacter infection; immune system; immunology; mouse; physiology","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067806906"

The total assembly size is 651.31 megabases (Mb) for pecan and 706.43 Mb for Chinese hickory. Two genome duplication events before the divergence from walnut were found in these species. Gene family analysis highlighted key genes in biotic and abiotic tolerance, oil, polyphenols, essential amino acids, and B vitamins. Further analyses of reduced-coverage genome sequences of 16 Carya and 2 Juglans species provide additional phylogenetic perspective on crop wild relatives.

Chronic infection with this parasitic trematode can lead to urogenital conditions including female genital schistosomiasis and bladder cancer. At the molecular level, little is known about this blood fluke and the pathogenesis of the disease that it causes. To support molecular studies of this carcinogenic worm, we reported a draft genome for S. haematobium in 2012. Although a useful resource, its utility has been somewhat limited by its fragmentation. Findings: Here, we systematically enhanced the draft genome of S. haematobium using a single-molecule and long-range DNA-sequencing approach. We achieved a major improvement in the accuracy and contiguity of the genome assembly, making it superior or comparable to assemblies for other schistosome species. We transferred curated gene models to this assembly and, using enhanced gene annotation pipelines, inferred a gene set with as many or more complete gene models as those of other well-studied schistosomes. Using conserved, single-copy orthologs, we assessed the phylogenetic position of S. haematobium in relation to other parasitic flatworms for which draft genomes were available. Conclusions: We report a substantially enhanced genomic resource that represents a solid foundation for molecular research on S. haematobium and is poised to better underpin population and functional genomic investigations and to accelerate the search for new disease interventions. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Here, we present ""duphold,"" a new method to efficiently annotate SV calls with sequence depth information that can add (or remove) confidence to SVs that are predicted to affect copy number. Duphold indicates not only the change in depth across the event but also the presence of a rapid change in depth relative to the regions surrounding the break-points. It uses a unique algorithm that allows the run time to be nearly independent of the number of variants. This performance is important for large, jointly called projects with many samples, each of which must be evaluated at thousands of sites.

Here, we present a BCI dataset that includes the three major BCI paradigms with a large number of subjects over multiple sessions. In addition, information about the psychological and physiological conditions of BCI users was obtained using a questionnaire, and task-unrelated parameters such as resting state, artifacts, and electromyography of both arms were also recorded. We evaluated the decoding accuracies for the individual paradigms and determined performance variations across both subjects and sessions. Furthermore, we looked for more general, severe cases of BCI illiteracy than have been previously reported in the literature. Results: Average decoding accuracies across all subjects and sessions were 71.1% (± 0.15), 96.7% (± 0.05), and 95.1% (± 0.09), and rates of BCI illiteracy were 53.7%, 11.1%, and 10.2% for MI, ERP, and SSVEP, respectively. Compared to the ERP and SSVEP paradigms, the MI paradigm exhibited large performance variations between both subjects and sessions. Furthermore, we found that 27.8% (15 out of 54) of users were universally BCI literate, i.e., they were able to proficiently perform all three paradigms. Interestingly, we found no universally illiterate BCI user, i.e., all participants were able to control at least one type of BCI system. Conclusions: Our EEG dataset can be utilized for a wide range of BCI-related research questions. All methods for the data analysis in this study are supported with fully open-source scripts that can aid in every step of BCI technology. Furthermore, our results support previous but disjointed findings on the phenomenon of BCI illiteracy. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

Germplasm collections representing rice diversity, improved varieties, and elite breeding materials are accessible through rice gene banks for use in research and breeding, with many having genome sequences and high-density genotype data available. Combining phenotypic and genotypic information on these accessions enables genome-wide association analysis, which is driving quantitative trait loci discovery and molecular marker development. Comparative sequence analyses across quantitative trait loci regions facilitate the discovery of novel alleles. Analyses involving DNA sequences and large genotyping matrices for thousands of samples, however, pose a challenge to non−computer savvy rice researchers. Findings: The Rice Galaxy resource has shared datasets that include high-density genotypes from the 3,000 Rice Genomes project and sequences with corresponding annotations from 9 published rice genomes. The Rice Galaxy web server and deployment installer includes tools for designing single-nucleotide polymorphism assays, analyzing genome-wide association studies, population diversity, rice−bacterial pathogen diagnostics, and a suite of published genomic prediction methods. A prototype Rice Galaxy compliant to Open Access, Open Data, and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible principles is also presented.

Data errors need to be identified and corrected before integrative data analyses where different types of data are merged on the basis of the annotated labels. Data with labeling errors dampen true biological signals. More importantly, data analysis with sample errors could lead to wrong scientific conclusions. We developed a robust probabilistic multi-omics data matching procedure, proMODMatcher, to curate data and identify and correct data annotation and errors in large databases. Results: Application to simulated datasets suggests that proMODMatcher achieved robust statistical power even when the number of cis-associations was small and/or the number of samples was large. Application of our proMODMatcher to multi-omics datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium identified sample errors in multiple cancer datasets. Our procedure was not only able to identify sample-labeling errors but also to unambiguously identify the source of the errors. Our results demonstrate that these errors should be identified and corrected before integrative analysis. Conclusions: Our results indicate that sample-labeling errors were common in large multi-omics datasets. These errors should be corrected before integrative analysis. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Like other mustache toad species, V. ailaonica males temporarily develop keratinized nuptial spines on their upper jaw during each breeding season, which fall off at the end of the breeding season. This feature is likely result of the reversal of sexual dimorphism in body size, with males being larger than females. A high-quality reference genome for the mustache toad would be invaluable to investigate the genetic mechanism underlying these repeatedly developing keratinized spines. Findings: To construct the mustache toad genome, we generated 225 Gb of short reads and 277 Gb of long reads using Illumina and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing technologies, respectively. Sequencing data were assembled into a 3.53-Gb genome assembly, with a contig N50 length of 821 kb. We also used high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technology to identify contacts between contigs, then assembled contigs into scaffolds and assembled a genome with 13 chromosomes and a scaffold N50 length of 412.42 Mb. Based on the 26,227 protein-coding genes annotated in the genome, we analyzed phylogenetic relationships between the mustache toad and other chordate species. The mustache toad has a relatively higher evolutionary rate and separated from a common ancestor of the marine toad, bullfrog, and Tibetan frog 206.1 million years ago. Furthermore, we identified 201 expanded gene families in the mustache toad, which were mainly enriched in immune pathway, keratin filament, and metabolic processes. Conclusions: Using Illumina, PacBio, and Hi-C technologies, we constructed the first high-quality chromosome-level mustache toad genome. This work not only offers a valuable reference genome for functional studies of mustache toad traits but also provides important chromosomal information for wider genome comparisons. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Automated approaches for image capture and analysis have allowed for substantial increases in the throughput of quantitative growth trait measurements compared with manual assessments. Recent work has focused on adopting computer vision and machine learning approaches to improve the accuracy of automated plant phenotyping. Here we present PS-Plant, a low-cost and portable 3D plant phenotyping platform based on an imaging technique novel to plant phenotyping called photometric stereo (PS). Results: We calibrated PS-Plant to track the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana throughout the day-night (diel) cycle and investigated growth architecture under a variety of conditions to illustrate the dramatic effect of the environment on plant phenotype. We developed bespoke computer vision algorithms and assessed available deep neural network architectures to automate the segmentation of rosettes and individual leaves, and extract basic and more advanced traits from PS-derived data, including the tracking of 3D plant growth and diel leaf hyponastic movement. Furthermore, we have produced the first PS training data set, which includes 221 manually annotated Arabidopsis rosettes that were used for training and data analysis (1,768 images in total). A full protocol is provided, including all software components and an additional test data set. Conclusions: PS-Plant is a powerful new phenotyping tool for plant research that provides robust data at high temporal and spatial resolutions. The system is well-suited for small- and large-scale research and will help to accelerate bridging of the phenotype-to-genotype gap. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

By assessing the genes expressed, metatranscriptomics provides an understanding of the interactions between different major functional guilds and the environment. Here, we present a de novo assembly-based Comparative Metatranscriptomics Workflow (CoMW) implemented in a modular, reproducible structure. Metatranscriptomics typically uses short sequence reads, which can either be directly aligned to external reference databases (""assembly-free approach"") or first assembled into contigs before alignment (""assembly-based approach""). We also compare CoMW (assembly-based implementation) with an assembly-free alternative workflow, using simulated and real-world metatranscriptomes from Arctic and temperate terrestrial environments. We evaluate their accuracy in precision and recall using generic and specialized hierarchical protein databases. Results: CoMW provided significantly fewer false-positive results, resulting in more precise identification and quantification of functional genes in metatranscriptomes. Using the comprehensive database M5nr, the assembly-based approach identified genes with only 0.6% false-positive results at thresholds ranging from inclusive to stringent compared with the assembly-free approach, which yielded up to 15% false-positive results. Using specialized databases (carbohydrate-active enzyme and nitrogen cycle), the assembly-based approach identified and quantified genes with 3-5 times fewer false-positive results. We also evaluated the impact of both approaches on real-world datasets. Conclusions: We present an open source de novo assembly-based CoMW. Our benchmarking findings support assembling short reads into contigs before alignment to a reference database because this provides higher precision and minimizes false-positive results. © The Author(s) 2019.","carbohydrate; accuracy; Arctic; Article; benchmarking; CAZy gene; contig mapping; false positive result; gene; gene expression; gene identification; M5nr gene; metatranscriptomics; NCycDB gene; nitrogen cycle; priority journal; protein database; quantitative analysis; reference database; sequence alignment; space; workflow","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070884436"

Additionally, we identify synteny between POU and Hox genes that had previously been reported in a hydrozoan, suggesting this linkage is highly conserved, possibly dating back to at least the last common ancestor of Medusozoa, yet likely independent of vertebrate POU-Hox linkages. Conclusions: These draft genomes provide a valuable resource for studying the evolutionary history and biology of these extraordinary animals, and for identifying genomic features underlying venom, vision, and life history traits in Acraspeda. © The Author(s) 2019.

We aimed to discover CNVs in taurine cattle using a large collection of whole-genome sequences and to provide an interactive database of the identified CNV regions (CNVRs) that includes visualizations of sequence read alignments, CNV boundaries, and genome annotations. Results: CNVs were identified in each of 4 whole-genome sequencing datasets, which together represent >500 bulls from 17 breeds, using a popular multi-sample read-depth-based algorithm, cn.MOPS. Quality control and CNVR construction, performed dataset-wise to avoid batch effects, resulted in 26,223 CNVRs covering 107.75 unique Mb (4.05%) of the bovine genome. Hierarchical clustering of samples by CNVR genotypes indicated clear separation by breeds. An interactive HTML database was created that allows data filtering options, provides graphical and tabular data summaries including Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests on genotype proportions, and displays genes and quantitative trait loci at each CNVR. Notably, the database provides sequence read alignments at each CNVR genotype and the boundaries of constituent CNVs in individual samples. Besides numerous novel discoveries, we corroborated the genotypes reported for a CNVR at the KIT locus known to be associated with the piebald coat colour phenotype in Hereford and some Simmental cattle. Conclusions: We present a large comprehensive collection of taurine cattle CNVs in a novel interactive visual database that displays CNV boundaries, read depths, and genome features for individual CNVRs, thus providing users with a powerful means to explore and scrutinize CNVRs of interest more thoroughly. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Here we present a draft genome sequence of the male blue peacock using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore technology (ONT). Results: ONT sequencing gave ∼2.3-fold sequencing coverage, whereas Illumina generated 150–base pair paired-end sequence data at 284.6-fold coverage from 5 libraries. Subsequently, we generated a 0.915-gigabase pair de novo assembly of the peacock genome with a scaffold N50 of 0.23 megabase pairs (Mb). We predict that the peacock genome contains 23,153 protein-coding genes and 75.3 Mb (7.33%) of repetitive sequences. Conclusions: We report a high-quality assembly of the peacock genome using a hybrid approach of sequences generated by both Illumina and ONT. The long-read chemistry generated by ONT was useful for addressing challenges related to de novo assembly, particularly at regions containing repetitive sequences spanning longer than the read length, and which could not be resolved with only short-read–based assembly. Contig assembly of Illumina short reads gave an N50 of 1,639 bases, whereas with ONT, the N50 increased by >9-fold to 14,749 bases. The initial contig assembly based on Illumina sequencing reads alone gave 685,241 contigs. Further scaffolding on assembled contigs using both Illumina and ONT sequencing reads resulted in a final assembly of 15,025 super-scaffolds, with an N50 of ∼0.23 Mb. Ninety-five percent of proteins predicted by homology matched with those in a public repository, verifying the completeness of our assembly. Like other phylogenetic studies of avian conserved genes, we found P. cristatus to be most closely related to Gallus gallus, followed by Meleagris gallopavo and Anas platyrhynchos. Compared with the recently published peacock genome assembly, the current, superior, hybrid assembly has greater sequencing depth, fewer non-ATGC sequences, and fewer scaffolds. © The Author(s) 2019.

However, the level of cellular heterogeneity and diversity of nucleated cells in UCB has not yet been assessed in an unbiased and systemic fashion. In the present study, nucleated cells from UCB were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing to simultaneously profile the gene expression signatures of thousands of cells, generating a rich resource for further functional studies. Here, we report the transcriptomes of 17,637 UCB cells, covering 12 major cell types, many of which can be further divided into distinct subpopulations. Results: Pseudotemporal ordering of nucleated red blood cells identifies wave-like activation and suppression of transcription regulators, leading to a polarized cellular state, which may reflect nucleated red blood cell maturation. Progenitor cells in UCB also comprise 2 subpopulations with activation of divergent transcription programs, leading to specific cell fate commitment. Detailed profiling of cytotoxic cell populations unveiled granzymes B and K signatures in natural killer and natural killer T-cell types in UCB. Conclusions: Taken together, our data form a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape that reveals previously unrecognized cell types, pathways, and mechanisms of gene expression regulation. These data may contribute to the efficacy and outcome of UCB transplant, broadening the scope of research and clinical innovations. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

In these experiments, where the sample size is often limited, meta-analysis offers the possibility to considerably enhance the statistical power and give more accurate results. For those purposes, it combines either effect sizes or results of single studies in an appropriate manner. R packages metaMA and metaRNASeq perform meta-analysis on microarray and next generation sequencing (NGS) data, respectively. They are not interchangeable as they rely on statistical modeling specific to each technology. Results SMAGEXP (Statistical Meta-Analysis for Gene EXPression) integrates metaMA and metaRNAseq packages into Galaxy. We aim to propose a unified way to carry out meta-analysis of gene expression data, while taking care of their specificities. We have developed this tool suite to analyze microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database or custom data from Affymetrix © microarrays. These data are then combined to carry out meta-analysis using metaMA package. SMAGEXP also offers to combine raw read counts from NGS experiments using DESeq2 and metaRNASeq package. In both cases, key values, independent from the technology type, are reported to judge the quality of the meta-analysis. These tools are available on the Galaxy main tool shed. A dockerized instance of galaxy containing SMAGEXP and its dependencies is available on Docker hub. Source code, help, and installation instructions are available on GitHub.

Conventional sequence-based tools are insufficient to annotate the genomes of such divergent biological systems. Conversely, protein structure tolerates substantial variation in primary amino acid sequence and is thus a robust indicator of biochemical function. Structural proteomics is poised to become a standard part of pathogen genomics research; however, informatic methods are now required to assign confidence in large volumes of predicted structures. Aims: Our aim was to predict the proteome of a neglected human pathogen, Giardia duodenalis, and stratify predicted structures into high- and lower-confidence categories using a variety of metrics in isolation and combination. Methods: We used the I-TASSER suite to predict structural models for ∼5,000 proteins encoded in G. duodenalis and identify their closest empirically-determined structural homologues in the Protein Data Bank. Models were assigned to high- or lower-confidence categories depending on the presence of matching protein family (Pfam) domains in query and reference peptides. Metrics output from the suite and derived metrics were assessed for their ability to predict the high-confidence category individually, and in combination through development of a random forest classifier. Results: We identified 1,095 high-confidence models including 212 hypothetical proteins. Amino acid identity between query and reference peptides was the greatest individual predictor of high-confidence status; however, the random forest classifier outperformed any metric in isolation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.976) and identified a subset of 305 high-confidence-like models, corresponding to false-positive predictions. High-confidence models exhibited greater transcriptional abundance, and the classifier generalized across species, indicating the broad utility of this approach for automatically stratifying predicted structures. Additional structure-based clustering was used to cross-check confidence predictions in an expanded family of Nek kinases. Several high-confidence-like proteins yielded substantial new insight into mechanisms of redox balance in G. duodenalis-a system central to the efficacy of limited anti-giardial drugs.

However, the lack of a reference genome has, to date, limited the understanding of the genetic basis of aggression in this species. Here, we present the first reference genome assembly of the Siamese fighting fish. Findings: Frist, we sequenced and de novo assembled a 465.24-Mb genome for the B. splendens variety Giant, with a weighted average (N50) scaffold size of 949.03 Kb and an N50 contig size of 19.01 Kb, covering 99.93% of the estimated genome size. To obtain a chromosome-level genome assembly, we constructed one Hi-C library and sequenced 75.24 Gb reads using the BGISEQ-500 platform. We anchored approximately 93% of the scaffold sequences into 21 chromosomes and evaluated the quality of our assembly using the high-contact frequency heat map and Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs. We also performed comparative chromosome analyses between Oryzias latipes and B. splendens, revealing a chromosome conservation evolution in B. splendens. We predicted 23,981 genes assisted by RNA-sequencing data generated from brain, liver, muscle, and heart tissues of Giant and annotated 15% repetitive sequences in the genome. Additionally, we resequenced five other B. splendens varieties and detected ~3.4 M single-nucleotide variations and 27,305 insertions and deletions. Conclusions: We provide the first chromosome-level genome for the Siamese fighting fish. The genome will lay a valuable foundation for future research on aggression in B. splendens. © 2018.

It has been inferred, based on intracellular recordings from juvenile animals, that supragranular neurons are electrically mature by the fourth postnatal week. However, the dynamics of the neuronal integration in adulthood is largely unknown. Electrophysiological characterization of the active properties of these neurons throughout adulthood will help to address the biophysical and computational principles of the neuronal integration. Findings: Here, we provide a database of whole-cell intracellular recordings from 315 neurons located in the supragranular layers (L2/3) of the primary somatosensory cortex in adult mice (9-45 weeks old) from both sexes (females, N = 195; males, N = 120). Data include 361 somatic current-clamp (CC) and 476 voltage-clamp (VC) experiments, recorded using a step-and-hold protocol (CC, N = 257; VC, N = 46), frozen noise injections (CC, N = 104) and triangular voltage sweeps (VC, 10 (N = 132), 50 (N = 146) and 100 ms (N = 152)), from regular spiking (N = 169) and fast-spiking neurons (N = 66). Conclusions: The data can be used to systematically study the properties of somatic integration and the principles of action potential generation across sexes and across electrically characterized neuronal classes in adulthood. Understanding the principles of the somatic transformation of postsynaptic potentials into action potentials will shed light onto the computational principles of intracellular information transfer in single neurons and information processing in neuronal networks, helping to recreate neuronal functions in artificial systems.","Action Potentials; Aging; Animals; Databases, Factual; Female; Male; Mice; Neurons; Patch-Clamp Techniques; Somatosensory Cortex; action potential; aging; animal; factual database; female; male; mouse; nerve cell; patch clamp technique; physiology; somatosensory cortex","NLM (Medline)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058907958"

SIM is a valuable method for high-resolution imaging of fixed cells or tissues labeled with conventional fluorophores, as well as for imaging the dynamics of live cells expressing fluorescent protein constructs. In SIM, one acquires a set of images with shifting illumination patterns. This set of images is subsequently treated with image analysis algorithms to produce an image with reduced out-of-focus light (optical sectioning) and/or with improved resolution (super-resolution). Findings: Five complete, freely available SIM datasets are presented including raw and analyzed data. We report methods for image acquisition and analysis using open-source software along with examples of the resulting images when processed with different methods.We processed the data using established optical sectioning SIM and super-resolution SIM methods and with newer Bayesian restoration approaches that we are developing. Conclusions: Various methods for SIM data acquisition and processing are actively being developed, but complete raw data from SIM experiments are not typically published.

Emerging evidence demonstrates the presence of bacteria beyond the vagina. However, a microbiome-wide metagenomic analysis characterizing the diverse microbial communities has been lacking. Results We performed shotgun-sequencing of 52 samples from the cervical canal and the peritoneal fluid of Chinese women of reproductive age using the Illumina platform. Direct annotation of sequencing reads identified the taxonomy of bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses, confirming and extending the results from our previous study. We replicated our previous findings in another 24 samples from the vagina, the cervical canal, the uterus and the peritoneal fluid using the BGISEQ-500 platform revealing that microorganisms in the samples from the same individuals were largely shared in the entire reproductive tract. Human sequences made up more than 99% of the 20GB raw data. After filtering, vaginal microorganisms were well covered in the generated reproductive tract gene catalogue, while the more diverse upper reproductive tract microbiota would require greater depth of sequencing and more samples to meet the full coverage scale. Conclusions We provide novel detailed data on the microbial composition of a largely unchartered body site, the female reproductive tract. Our results indicated the presence of an intra-individual continuum of microorganisms that gradually changed from the vagina to the peritoneal fluid.

More recently, it has been shown that bats may also serve as a new and excellent model to study aging, inflammation, and cancer, among other important biological processes. The cave nectar bat or lesser dawn bat (Eonycteris spelaea) is known to be a reservoir for several viruses and intracellular bacteria. It is widely distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics from India to Southeast Asia and pollinates several plant species, including the culturally and economically important durian in the region. Here, we report the whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing, followed by subsequent de novo assembly, of the E. spelaea genome solely using the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read sequencing platform. Findings The newly assembled E. spelaea genome is 1.97 Gb in length and consists of 4,470 sequences with a contig N50 of 8.0 Mb. Identified repeat elements covered 34.65% of the genome, and 20,640 unique protein-coding genes with 39,526 transcripts were annotated. Conclusions We demonstrated that the PacBio long-read sequencing platform alone is sufficient to generate a comprehensive de novo assembled genome and transcriptome of an important bat species. These results will provide useful insights and act as a resource to expand our understanding of bat evolution, ecology, physiology, immunology, viral infection, and transmission dynamics. © The Author(s) 2018.

Deciphering genotype-phenotype relationships has been crucial to understanding normal and disease biology. Analysis of molecular pathways has provided an invaluable tool to such understanding; however, typically it does not consider the physical microenvironment, which is a key determinant of phenotype. In this study, we present a novel modeling framework that enables the study of the link between genotype, signaling networks, and cell behavior in a three-dimensional microenvironment. To achieve this, we bring together Agent-Based Modeling, a powerful computational modeling technique, and gene networks. This combination allows biological hypotheses to be tested in a controlled stepwise fashion, and it lends itself naturally to model a heterogeneous population of cells acting and evolving in a dynamic microenvironment, which is needed to predict the evolution of complex multi-cellular dynamics. Importantly, this enables modeling co-occurring intrinsic perturbations, such as mutations, and extrinsic perturbations, such as nutrient availability, and their interactions. Using cancer as a model system, we illustrate how this framework delivers a unique opportunity to identify determinants of single-cell behavior, while uncovering emerging properties of multi-cellular growth.

However, such tools are usually platform bound and are not easily reusable by other systems. Furthermore, they rarely address access restriction issues when direct data transfer is not permitted. In this article, we present an analytical service that works in tandem with a visualization library to address these problems. Findings: Using a combination of existing technologies and a platform-specific data abstraction layer, we developed a service that is capable of providing existing web-based data warehouses and repositories with platform-independent visual analytical capabilities. The design of this service also allows for federated data analysis by eliminating the need to move the data directly to the researcher. Instead, all operations are based on statistics and interactive charts without direct access to the dataset. Conclusions: The software presented in this article has a potential to help translational researchers achieve a better understanding of a given dataset and quickly generate new hypotheses. Furthermore, it provides a framework that can be used to share and reuse explorative analysis tools within the community.","Databases, Factual; Electronic Data Processing; Software; Translational Medical Research; factual database; information processing; procedures; software; translational research","NLM (Medline)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055913213"

Combinatorial use of multiple sensors to acquire various spectra has allowed us to noninvasively obtain a series of datasets, including those related to the development and physiological responses of plants throughout their life. Automated phenotyping platforms accelerate the elucidation of gene functions associated with traits in model plants under controlled conditions.

With the rise of Internet of Things technologies (IoT) in recent years, many IoT-based remote sensing devices have been applied to plant phenotyping and crop monitoring, which are generating terabytes of biological datasets every day. However, it is still technically challenging to calibrate, annotate, and aggregate the big data effectively, especially when they were produced in multiple locations and at different scales. Findings: CropSight is a PHP Hypertext Pre-processor and structured query language-based server platform that provides automated data collation, storage, and information management through distributed IoT sensors and phenotyping workstations. It provides a two-component solution to monitor biological experiments through networked sensing devices, with interfaces specifcally designed for distributed plant phenotyping and centralized data management. Data transfer and annotation are accomplished automatically through an hypertext transfer protocol-accessible RESTful API installed on both device side and server side of the CropSight system, which synchronize daily representative crop growth images for visual-based crop assessment and hourly microclimate readings for GxE studies. CropSight also supports the comparison of historical and ongoing crop performance while different experiments are being conducted. Conclusions: As a scalable and open-source information management system, CropSight can be used to maintain and collate important crop performance and microclimate datasets captured by IoT sensors and distributed phenotyping installations. It provides near real-time environmental and crop growth monitoring in addition to historical and current experiment comparison through an integrated cloud-ready server system. Accessible both locally in the feld through smart devices and remotely in an offce using a personal computer, CropSight has been applied to feld experiments of bread wheat prebreeding since 2016 and speed breeding since 2017. We believe that the CropSight system could have a signifcant impact on scalable plant phenotyping and IoT-style crop management to enable smart agricultural practices in the near future. © 2019 The Author(s).","Crops, Agricultural; Internet; Microclimate; Phenotype; Software; Triticum; Article; automation; calibration; crop; crop management; information processing; information system; microclimate; monitoring; nonhuman; phenotype; plant; plant growth; priority journal; anatomy and histology; Internet; phenotype; software; wheat","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063293087"

Cane toads are known for their rapid adaptation and deleterious impacts on native fauna in invaded regions. However, despite an iconic status, there are major gaps in our understanding of cane toad genetics. The availability of a genome would help to close these gaps and accelerate cane toad research. Findings: We report a draft genome assembly for R. marina, the first of its kind for the Bufonidae family. We used a combination of long-read Pacific Biosciences RS II and short-read Illumina HiSeq X sequencing to generate 359.5 Gb of raw sequence data. The final hybrid assembly of 31,392 scaffolds was 2.55 Gb in length with a scaffold N50 of 168 kb. BUSCO analysis revealed that the assembly included full length or partial fragments of 90.6% of tetrapod universal single-copy orthologs (n = 3950), illustrating that the gene-containing regions have been well assembled. Annotation predicted 25,846 protein coding genes with similarity to known proteins in Swiss-Prot. Repeat sequences were estimated to account for 63.9% of the assembly. Conclusions: The R. marina draft genome assembly will be an invaluable resource that can be used to further probe the biology of this invasive species. Future analysis of the genome will provide insights into cane toad evolution and enrich our understanding of their interplay with the ecosystem at large.","Animals; Bufonidae; Genome; Introduced Species; Molecular Sequence Annotation; animal; Bufonidae; genetics; genome; introduced species; molecular genetics","NLM (Medline)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055910505"

Early diagnosis and effective treatment offer cost benefits. Many studies on biochemical and imaging markers have shown potential promise in improving diagnosis, yet establishing quantitative diagnostic criteria for ancillary tests remains challenging. Results: We have developed a similarity-based approach that matches individuals to subjects with similar conditions. We modeled the disease with a Gaussian process, and tested the method in the Alzheimer's Disease Big Data DREAM Challenge. Ranked the highest among submitted methods, our diagnostic model predicted cognitive impairment scores in an independent dataset test with a correlation score of 0.573. It differentiated AD patients from control subjects with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.920. Without knowing longitudinal information about subjects, the model predicted patients who are vulnerable to conversion from mild-cognitive impairment to AD through the similarity network.

However, breeding efforts to improve fruit quality in blueberry have been greatly hampered by the lack of adequate genomic resources and a limited understanding of the underlying genetics encoding key traits. The genome of highbush blueberry has been particularly challenging to assemble due, in large part, to its polyploid nature and genome size. Findings Here, we present a chromosome-scale and haplotype-phased genome assembly of the cultivar ""Draper,"" which has the highest antioxidant levels among a diversity panel of 71 cultivars and 13 wild Vaccinium species. We leveraged this genome, combined with gene expression and metabolite data measured across fruit development, to identify candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of important phytonutrients among other metabolites associated with superior fruit quality. Genome-wide analyses revealed that both polyploidy and tandem gene duplications modified various pathways involved in the biosynthesis of key phytonutrients. Furthermore, gene expression analyses hint at the presence of a spatial-temporal specific dominantly expressed subgenome including during fruit development. Conclusions These findings and the reference genome will serve as a valuable resource to guide future genome-enabled breeding of important agronomic traits in highbush blueberry. © 2019 The Author(s).

There is a pressing need to improve or finish draft plant genome assemblies. Findings: Here, we present a chromosome-scale assembly of the black raspberry genome using single-molecule real-time Pacific Biosciences sequencing and high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) genome scaffolding. The updated V3 assembly has a contig N50 of 5.1 Mb, representing an ∼200-fold improvement over the previous Illumina-based version. Each of the 235 contigs was anchored and oriented into seven chromosomes, correcting several major misassemblies. Black raspberry V3 contains 47 Mb of new sequences including large pericentromeric regions and thousands of previously unannotated protein-coding genes. Among the new genes are hundreds of expanded tandem gene arrays that were collapsed in the Illumina-based assembly. Detailed comparative genomics with the high-quality V4 woodland strawberry genome (Fragaria vesca) revealed near-perfect 1:1 synteny with dramatic divergence in tandem gene array composition. Lineage-specific tandem gene arrays in black raspberry are related to agronomic traits such as disease resistance and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Conclusions: The improved resolution of tandem gene arrays highlights the need to reassemble these highly complex and biologically important regions in draft plant genomes. The updated, high-quality black raspberry reference genome will be useful for comparative genomics across the horticulturally important Rosaceae family and enable the development of marker assisted breeding in Rubus.","Chromosomes, Plant; Genome, Plant; Genomics; Rubus; Sequence Analysis, DNA; DNA sequence; genetics; genomics; plant chromosome; plant genome; Rubus","NLM (Medline)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055078439"

However, a chromosome-level reference genome is lacking, and an evolutionary view of alternative splicing (AS) in bamboo remains unclear despite emerging omics data and improved technologies. Results: Here, we provide a chromosome-level de novo genome assembly of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) using additional abundance sequencing data and a Hi-C scaffolding strategy. The significantly improved genome is a scaffold N50 of 79.90 Mb, approximately 243 times longer than the previous version. A total of 51,074 high-quality protein-coding loci with intact structures were identified using single-molecule real-time sequencing and manual verification. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive AS profile based on the identification of 266,711 unique AS events in 25,225 AS genes by large-scale transcriptomic sequencing of 26 representative bamboo tissues using both the Illumina and Pacific Biosciences sequencing platforms. Through comparisons with orthologous genes in related plant species, we observed that the AS genes are concentrated among more conserved genes that tend to accumulate higher transcript levels and share less tissue specificity. Furthermore, gene family expansion, abundant AS, and positive selection were identified in crucial genes involved in the lignin biosynthetic pathway of moso bamboo. Conclusions: These fundamental studies provide useful information for future in-depth analyses of comparative genome and AS features. Additionally, our results highlight a global perspective of AS during evolution and diversification in bamboo.","Alternative Splicing; Chromosomes, Plant; Computational Biology; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genome, Plant; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Lignin; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Poaceae; lignin; alternative RNA splicing; biology; biosynthesis; gene expression regulation; genetics; genomics; high throughput sequencing; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; plant chromosome; plant genome; Poaceae; procedures","NLM (Medline)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055618711"

The development of high-throughput microscopy and image analysis has enabled scratch assays to become compatible with high-throughput research. However, effective processing and in-depth analysis of such high-throughput image datasets are far from trivial and require integration of multiple image processing and data extraction software tools. Findings: We developed and implemented a kinetic re-epithelialization analysis pipeline (KREAP) in Galaxy. The KREAP toolbox incorporates freely available image analysis tools and automatically performs image segmentation and feature extraction of each image series, followed by automatic quantification of cells inside and outside the scratched area over time. The enumeration of infiltrating cells over time is modeled to extract three biologically relevant parameters that describe re-epithelialization kinetics. The output of the tools is organized, displayed, and saved in the Galaxy environment for future reference. Conclusions: The KREAP toolbox in Galaxy provides an open-source, easy-to-use, web-based platform for reproducible image processing and data analysis of high-throughput scratch assays. The KREAP toolbox could assist a broad scientific community in the discovery of compounds that are able to modulate re-epithelialization kinetics. © The Author(s) 2018.

Of these, we sequenced 761 samples and collected voucher specimens stored in the Herbarium of China National GeneBank. Results: The 761 sequenced samples represented 689 vascular plant species from 137 families belonging to 49 orders. Of these, 257 samples were identified to the species level and 504 to the family level, using specimen and chloroplast sequences. In total, we generated 54 Tb of sequencing data, with an average sequencing depth of 60X per species, as estimated from genome sizes. A reference phylogeny was reconstructed with 78 chloroplast genes for molecular identification and other possible applications.

MetaPGN also includes a self-developed Cytoscape plugin for layout of and interaction with the resulting pangenome network, providing an intuitive and interactive interface for full exploration of genetic diversity. We demonstrate the utility of MetaPGN by constructing Escherichia coli pangenome networks from five E. coli pathogenic strains and 760 human gut microbiomes,revealing extensive genetic diversity of E. coli within both isolates and gut microbial populations.

Genomic techniques can provide important insights about past population sizes and local adaptation and can aid in the development of breeding management plans. This information is important for fields such as conservation genetics, where endangered species require critical and immediate attention. However, funding for genomic-based methods can be sparse for conservation projects, as costs for general species management can consume budgets. Findings Here, we report the generation of high-quality reference genomes for the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) at a low cost (<3000), thereby facilitating future studies of this endangered canid. We generated assemblies for three individuals using the linked-read 10x Genomics Chromium system. The most continuous assembly had a scaffold and contig N50 of 21 Mb and 83 Kb, respectively, and completely reconstructed 95% of a set of conserved mammalian genes. Additionally, we estimate the heterozygosity and demographic history of African wild dogs, revealing that although they have historically low effective population sizes, heterozygosity remains high. Conclusions We show that 10x Genomics Chromium data can be used to effectively generate high-quality genomes from Illumina short-read data of intermediate coverage ( 1/425x-50x). Interestingly, the wild dog shows higher heterozygosity than other species of conservation concern, possibly due to its behavioral ecology. The availability of reference genomes for non-model organisms will facilitate better genetic monitoring of threatened species such as the African wild dog and help conservationists to better understand the ecology and adaptability of those species in a changing environment. © The Author(s) 2018.

The data include activity recordings of 58 different cultures, with 1-2 regions of interest recorded for each culture. Production procedures, experimental protocols, and reuse options are included. The data have been suitable to reveal changes in the activity and morphology of the cultures and enabled observation and analysis of neuron-astrocyte and isolated astrocyte culture behaviors under the applied perturbations. Conclusions: Our dataset is sufficient to show significant changes in activity and morphology of neuron-astrocyte networks in culture under the applied stimulations. More than 100 recordings of 58 different cultures give insight of the observation's significance and led to conclusions about astrocyte activity and neuron-astrocyte network communication. Making it available here will allow others to test new tools for calcium imaging analysis and extracellular neuronal voltage recordings.","Animals; Astrocytes; Calcium; Cell Communication; Humans; Molecular Imaging; Neurons; Norepinephrine; calcium; noradrenalin; animal; astrocyte; cell communication; human; metabolism; molecular imaging; nerve cell; physiology; procedures","NLM (Medline)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060809663"

ATUMI feeds on both fruits and bee nest products, facilitating its spread and increasing its impact on honey bees and other pollinators. We have sequenced and annotated the ATUMI genome, providing the first genomic resources for this species and for the Nitidulidae, a beetle family that is closely related to the extraordinarily species-rich clade of beetles known as the Phytophaga. ATUMI thus provides a contrasting view as a neighbor for one of the most successful known animal groups. Results: We present a robust genome assembly and a gene set possessing 97.5% of the core proteins known from the holometabolous insects. The ATUMI genome encodes fewer enzymes for plant digestion than the genomes of wood-feeding beetles but nonetheless shows signs of broad metabolic plasticity. Gustatory receptors are few in number compared to other beetles, especially receptors with known sensitivity (in other beetles) to bitter substances. In contrast, several gene families implicated in detoxification of insecticides and adaptation to diverse dietary resources show increased copy numbers. The presence and diversity of homologs involved in detoxification differ substantially from the bee hosts of ATUMI. Conclusions: Our results provide new insights into the genomic basis for local adaption and invasiveness in ATUMI and a blueprint for control strategies that target this pest without harming their honey bee hosts. A minimal set of gustatory receptors is consistent with the observation that, once a host colony is invaded, food resources are predictable. Unique detoxification pathways and pathway members can help identify which treatments might control this species even in the presence of honey bees, which are notoriously sensitive to pesticides.","Acetylcholinesterase; Animals; ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters; Bees; Coleoptera; Genetic Variation; Genome; Glycoside Hydrolases; Herbivory; Insect Proteins; Insecticides; Phylogeny; Receptors, Cell Surface; Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels; ABC transporter; acetylcholinesterase; cell surface receptor; glycosidase; insect protein; insecticide; voltage gated sodium channel; animal; bee; beetle; classification; genetic variation; genetics; genome; herbivory; metabolism; parasitology; phylogeny","NLM (Medline)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058918792"

While analyses using molecular markers and population genetics have been conducted, genomic resources are lacking. Findings: Here, we report a chromosome-scale assembly of the spotted sea bass genome by high-depth genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation. The genome scale was 0.67 Gb with contig and scaffold N50 length of 31 Kb and 1,040 Kb, respectively. Hi-C scaffolding of the genome resulted in 24 pseudochromosomes containing 77.68% of the total assembled sequences. A total of 132.38 Mb repeat sequences were detected, accounting for 20.73% of the assembled genome. A total of 22, 015 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 96.52% were homologous to proteins in various databases. In addition, we constructed a phylogenetic tree using 1,586 single-copy gene families and identified 125 unique gene families in the spotted sea bass genome.

Oplegnathus fasciatus has become an important fishery resource for offshore cage aquaculture and fish stocking of marine ranching in China, Japan, and Korea. Recently, sexual dimorphism in growth with neo-sex chromosome and widespread biotic diseases in O. fasciatus have been increasing concern in the industry. However, adequate genome resources for gaining insight into sex-determining mechanisms and establishing genetically resistant breeding systems for O. fasciatus are lacking. Here, we analyzed the entire genome of a female O. fasciatus fish using long-read sequencing and Hi-C data to generate chromosome-length scaffolds and a highly contiguous genome assembly. Findings We assembled the O. fasciatus genome with a total of 245.0 Gb of raw reads that were generated using both Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) Sequel and Illumina HiSeq 2000 platforms. The final draft genome assembly was approximately 778.7 Mb, which reached a high level of continuity with a contig N50 of 2.1 Mb. The genome size was consistent with the estimated genome size (777.5 Mb) based on k-mer analysis. We combined Hi-C data with a draft genome assembly to generate chromosome-length scaffolds. Twenty-four scaffolds corresponding to the 24 chromosomes were assembled to a final size of 768.8 Mb with a contig N50 of 2.1 Mb and a scaffold N50 of 33.5 Mb using 1,372 contigs. The identified repeat sequences accounted for 33.9% of the entire genome, and 24 003 protein-coding genes with an average of 10.1 exons per gene were annotated using de novo methods, with RNA sequencing data and homologies to other teleosts. According to phylogenetic analysis using protein-coding genes, O. fasciatus is closely related to Larimichthys crocea, with O. fasciatus diverging from their common ancestor approximately 70.5-88.5 million years ago. Conclusions We generated a high-quality draft genome for O. fasciatus using long-read PacBio sequencing technology, which represents the first chromosome-level reference genome for Oplegnathidae species. Assembly of this genome assists research into fish sex-determining mechanisms and can serve as a resource for accelerating genome-assisted improvements in resistant breeding systems. © 2019 The Author(s).

The use of cryo-protective agents (CPAs) such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), glycerol, or trehalose is paramount to reducing cellular cryo-injury, but their effectiveness is still limited. The current study focuses on establishing and modulating the proteomic and the corresponding biological profiles associated with the cryo-injury of human leukemia (HL-60) cells cryopreserved in DMSO alone or DMSO +/- novel CPAs (e.g., nigerose [Nig] or salidroside [Sal]). Findings To reduce cryo-damage, HL-60 cells were cultured prior and post cryopreservation in malondialdehyde Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium-1640 media +/- Nig or Sal. Shotgun proteomic analysis showed significant alterations in the levels of proteins in cells cryopreserved in Nig or Sal compared to DMSO. Nig mostly affected cellular metabolism and energy pathways, whereas Sal increased the levels of proteins associated with DNA repair/duplication, RNA transcription, and cell proliferation. Validation testing showed that the proteome profile associated with Sal was correlated with a 2.8-fold increase in cell proliferative rate. At the functional level, both Nig and Sal increased glutathione reductase (0.0012±6.19E-05 and 0.0016±3.04E-05 mU/mL, respectively) compared to DMSO controls (0.0003±3.7E-05 mU/mL) and reduced cytotoxicity by decreasing lactate dehydrogenase activities (from -2.5 to -4.75 fold) and lipid oxidation (-1.6 fold). In contrast, only Nig attenuated protein carbonylation or oxidation. Conclusions We have identified key molecules and corresponding functional pathways underpinning the effect of cryopreservation (+/- CPAs) of HL-60 cells. We also validated the proteomic findings by identifying the corresponding biological profiles associated with promoting an anti-oxidative environment post cryopreservation. Nig or Sal in comparison to DMSO showed differential or additive effects in regard to reducing cryo-injury and enhancing cell survival/proliferation post thaw. These results can provide useful insight to cryo-damage and the design of enhanced cryomedia formulation. © The Author(s) 2018.","Cell Proliferation; Cryopreservation; Cryoprotective Agents; Disaccharides; Glucosides; HL-60 Cells; Humans; Lipid Peroxidation; Oxidation-Reduction; Phenols; Protein Carbonylation; Proteome; Proteomics; cryoprotective agent; lactate dehydrogenase; nigerose; salidroside; unclassified drug; cryoprotective agent; disaccharide; glucoside; laminaribiose; phenol derivative; proteome; salidroside; Article; cell damage; cell metabolism; cell nucleus; cell proliferation; controlled study; cryopreservation; cytotoxicity; DNA repair; enzyme activity; HL-60 cell line; human; human cell; lipid oxidation; priority journal; protein carbonylation; proteomics; RNA transcription; drug effect; HL-60 cell line; lipid peroxidation; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062296640"

The differentiation process of neural-tube-like rosettes in vitro is representative of neural tube structures, which are composed of radially organized, columnar epithelial cells and give rise to functional neural cells. However, the underlying regulatory network of cell fate commitment during early neural differentiation remains elusive. Results: In this study, we investigated the genome-wide transcriptome profile of single cells from six consecutive reprogramming and neural differentiation time points and identified cellular subpopulations present at each differentiation stage. Based on the inferred reconstructed trajectory and the characteristics of subpopulations contributing the most toward commitment to the central nervous system lineage at each stage during differentiation, we identified putative novel transcription factors in regulating neural differentiation. In addition, we dissected the dynamics of chromatin accessibility at the neural differentiation stages and revealed active cis-regulatory elements for transcription factors known to have a key role in neural differentiation as well as for those that we suggest are also involved. Further, communication network analysis demonstrated that cellular interactions most frequently occurred in the embryoid body stage and that each cell subpopulation possessed a distinctive spectrum of ligands and receptors associated with neural differentiation that could reflect the identity of each subpopulation. Conclusions: Our study provides a comprehensive and integrative study of the transcriptomics and epigenetics of human early neural differentiation, which paves the way for a deeper understanding of the regulatory mechanisms driving the differentiation of the neural lineage. © 2018.

However, many assemblies, including reference assemblies, are unfinished and have a number of gaps. Long reads obtained from third-generation sequencing (TGS) platforms can help close these gaps and improve assembly contiguity. However, current gap-closure approaches using long reads require extensive runtime and high memory usage. Thus, a fast and memory-efficient approach using long reads is needed to obtain complete genomes. Findings: We developed LR Gapcloser to rapidly and efficiently close the gaps in genome assembly. This tool utilizes long reads generated from TGS sequencing platforms. Tested on de novo assembled gaps, repeat-derived gaps, and real gaps, LR Gapcloser closed a higher number of gaps faster and with a lower error rate and a much lower memory usage than two existing, state-of-the art tools. This tool utilized raw reads to fill more gaps than when using error-corrected reads. It is applicable to gaps in the assemblies by different approaches and from large and complex genomes. After performing gap-closure using this tool, the contig N50 size of the human CHM1 genome was improved from 143 kb to 19 Mb, a 132-fold increase. We also closed the gaps in the Triticum urartu genome, a large genome rich in repeats; the contig N50 size was increased by 40%. Further, we evaluated the contiguity and correctness of six hybrid assembly strategies by combining the optimal TGS-based and next-generation sequencing-based assemblers with LR Gapcloser. A proposed and optimal hybrid strategy generated a new human CHM1 genome assembly with marked contiguity. The contig N50 value was greater than 28 Mb, which is larger than previous non-reference assemblies of the diploid human genome. Conclusions: LR Gapcloser is a fast and efficient tool that can be used to close gaps and improve the contiguity of genome assemblies. A proposed hybrid assembly including this tool promises reference-grade assemblies. © The Author(s) 2018.","Algorithms; Computational Biology; Contig Mapping; Genome, Human; Genome, Plant; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Triticum; algorithm; Article; Caenorhabditis elegans; genome assembly; LR Gapcloser; molecular genetic phenomena and functions; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; plant genome; priority journal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; sequence alignment; Triticum urartu; wheat; algorithm; biology; contig mapping; DNA sequence; genetics; high throughput sequencing; human; human genome; procedures","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059796929"

The last few years have seen the introduction of many new technologies for genome assembly. These new technologies and associated new algorithms are typically benchmarked on microbial genomes or, if they scale appropriately, on larger (e.g., human) genomes. However, plant genomes can be much more repetitive and larger than the human genome, and plant biochemistry often makes obtaining high-quality DNA that is free from contaminants difficult. Reflecting their challenging nature, we observe that plant genome assembly statistics are typically poorer than for vertebrates. Results Here, we compare Illumina short read, Pacific Biosciences long read, 10x Genomics linked reads, Dovetail Hi-C, and BioNano Genomics optical maps, singly and combined, in producing high-quality long-range genome assemblies of the potato species Solanum verrucosum. We benchmark the assemblies for completeness and accuracy, as well as DNA compute requirements and sequencing costs. Conclusions The field of genome sequencing and assembly is reaching maturity, and the differences we observe between assemblies are surprisingly small. We expect that our results will be helpful to other genome projects, and that these datasets will be used in benchmarking by assembly algorithm developers. © 2019 The Author(s).

Thus, a systematic effort to exploit genotypic and phenotypic diversity to boost yeast's industrial value is still urgently needed. Results: We analyzed 5,400 growth curves obtained from 36 S. cerevisiae strains and comprehensively profiled their resistances against 13 industrially relevant stresses. We observed that bioethanol and brewing strains exhibit higher resistance against acidic conditions; however, plant isolates tend to have a wider range of resistance, which may be associated with their metabolome and fluxome signatures in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid metabolism. By deep genomic sequencing, we found that industrial strains have more genomic duplications especially affecting transcription factors, showing that they result from disparate evolutionary paths in comparison with the environmental strains, which have more indels, gene deletions, and strain-specific genes. Genome-wide association studies coupled with protein-protein interaction networks uncovered novel genetic determinants of stress resistances.

To facilitate further population genetics and genomic studies, we present a reference genome assembly for the European subspecies (H. r. rustica). Findings: As part of the Genome10K effort on generating high-quality vertebrate genomes (Vertebrate Genomes Project), we have assembled a highly contiguous genome assembly using single molecule real-time (SMRT) DNA sequencing and several Bionano optical map technologies. We compared and integrated optical maps derived from both the Nick, Label, Repair, and Stain technology and from the Direct Label and Stain (DLS) technology. As proposed by Bionano, DLS more than doubled the scaffold N50 with respect to the nickase. The dual enzyme hybrid scaffold led to a further marginal increase in scaffold N50 and an overall increase of confidence in the scaffolds. After removal of haplotigs, the final assembly is approximately 1.21 Gbp in size, with a scaffold N50 value of more than 25.95 Mbp. Conclusions: This high-quality genome assembly represents a valuable resource for future studies of population genetics and genomics in the barn swallow and for studies concerning the evolution of avian genomes. It also represents one of the very first genomes assembled by combining SMRT long-read sequencing with the new Bionano DLS technology for scaffolding.

However, big datasets also lead to extreme computational challenges, especially when sophisticated statistical models are employed to simultaneously reduce false positives and false negatives. The newly developed fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU) method uses a bin method under the assumption that quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) are evenly distributed throughout the genome. The estimated QTNs are used to separate a mixed linear model into a computationally efficient fixed effect model (FEM) and a computationally expensive random effect model (REM), which are then used iteratively. To completely eliminate the computationally expensive REM, we replaced REM with FEM by using Bayesian information criteria. To eliminate the requirement that QTNs be evenly distributed throughout the genome, we replaced the bin method with linkage disequilibrium information. The new method is called Bayesian-information and Linkage-disequilibrium Iteratively Nested Keyway (BLINK). Both real and simulated data analyses demonstrated that BLINK improves statistical power compared to FarmCPU, in addition to remarkably reducing computing time. Now, a dataset with one million individuals and one-half million markers can be analyzed within three hours, instead of one week using FarmCPU. © The Author(s) 2018.

Key to this is the accurate identification of exon-exon junctions from RNA sequenced (RNA-seq) reads. A number of RNA-seq aligners capable of splitting reads across these splice junctions (SJs) have been developed; however, it has been shown that while they correctly identify most genuine SJs available in a given sample, they also often produce large numbers of incorrect SJs. Here, we describe the extent of this problem using popular RNA-seq mapping tools and present a new method, called Portcullis, to rapidly filter false SJs derived from spliced alignments. We show that Portcullis distinguishes between genuine and false-positive junctions to a high degree of accuracy across different species, samples, expression levels, error profiles, and read lengths.

It can reconstruct undirected networks, i.e., relevance networks, sensu stricto, as well as directed networks, referred to as causal relevance networks. The generalized approach allows the use of an arbitrary measure of pairwise association between nodes, an arbitrary scoring scheme that transforms the associations into weights of the network links, and a method for inferring the directions of the links. While this makes the approach powerful and flexible, it introduces the challenge of finding a combination of components that would perform well on a given inference task. Results: We address this challenge by performing an extensive empirical analysis of the performance of 114 variants of the generalized relevance network approach on 47 tasks of gene network inference from time-series data and 39 tasks of gene network inference from steady-state data. We compare the different variants in a multi-objective manner, considering their ranking in terms of different performance metrics. The results suggest a set of recommendations that provide guidance for selecting an appropriate variant of the approach in different data settings. Conclusions: The association measures based on correlation, combined with a particular scoring scheme of asymmetric weighting, lead to optimal performance of the relevance network approach in the general case. In the two special cases of inference tasks involving short time-series data and/or large networks, association measures based on identifying qualitative trends in the time series are more appropriate. © 2018.

Results: Here, we report a high-quality genome assembly of the tegu lizard, Salvator merianae, the first lacertoid with a sequenced genome. We combined 74X Illumina short-read, 29.8X Pacific Biosciences long-read, and optical mapping data to generate a high-quality assembly with a scaffold N50 value of 55.4 Mb. The contig N50 value of this assembly is 521 Kb, making it the most contiguous reptile assembly so far. We show that the tegu assembly has the highest completeness of coding genes and conserved non-exonic elements (CNEs) compared to other reptiles. Furthermore, the tegu assembly has the highest number of evolutionarily conserved CNE pairs, corroborating a high assembly contiguity in intergenic regions. As in other reptiles, long interspersed nuclear elements comprise the most abundant transposon class. We used transcriptomic data, homology- and de novo gene predictions to annotate 22,413 coding genes, of which 16,995 (76%) likely have human orthologs as inferred by CESAR-derived gene mappings. Finally, we generated a multiple genome alignment comprising 10 squamates and 7 other amniote species and identified conserved regions that are under evolutionary constraint. CNEs cover 38 Mb (1.8%) of the tegu genome, with 3.3 Mb in these elements being squamate specific. In contrast to placental mammal-specific CNEs, very few of these squamate-specific CNEs (<20 Kb) overlap transposons, highlighting a difference in how lineage-specific CNEs originated in these two clades.

Many bioinformatics tools require counts of substrings of length k in DNA/RNA sequencing reads obtained for applications such as genome and transcriptome assembly, error correction, multiple sequence alignment, and repeat detection. Recently, several techniques have been developed to count k-mers in large sequencing datasets, with a trade-off between the time and memory required to perform this function. We assessed several k-mer counting programs and evaluated their relative performance, primarily on the basis of runtime and memory usage. We also considered additional parameters such as disk usage, accuracy, parallelism, the impact of compressed input, performance in terms of counting large k values and the scalability of the application to larger datasets.We make specific recommendations for the setup of a current state-of-the-art program and suggestions for further development. © 2018 The Author(s).","Animals; Arabidopsis; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Genome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software; Transcriptome; transcriptome; article; high throughput sequencing; memory; animal; Arabidopsis; biology; DNA sequence; genetic database; genetics; genome; high throughput sequencing; human; procedures; sequence alignment; software","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057977029"

Altogether, the technique and experimental procedures are becoming more straightforward and available to biologists from diverse fields, even without any profound experience in DNA sequencing. Thus, the introduction of the MinION device by Oxford Nanopore Technologies promises to ""bring sequencing technology to the masses""and also allows quick and operative analysis in field studies. However, the convenience of this sequencing technology dramatically contrasts with the available analysis tools, which may significantly reduce enthusiasm of a ""regular""user. To really bring the sequencing technology to every biologist, we need a set of user-friendly tools that can perform a powerful analysis in an automatic manner. Findings: NanoPipe was developed in consideration of the specifics of the MinION sequencing technologies, providing accordingly adjusted alignment parameters. The range of the target species/sequences for the alignment is not limited, and the descriptive usage page of NanoPipe helps a user to succeed with NanoPipe analysis. The results contain alignment statistics, consensus sequence, polymorphisms data, and visualization of the alignment. Several test cases are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the tool. Conclusions: Freely available NanoPipe software allows effortless and reliable analysis of MinION sequencing data for experienced bioinformaticians, as well for wet-lab biologists with minimum bioinformatics knowledge. Moreover, for the latter group, we describe the basic algorithm necessary for MinION sequencing analysis from the first to last step.  © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

While Oxford Nanopore or Pacific Biosciences sequencing platforms overcome this limitation, their application has been limited due to higher error rates or lower data output. Results: In this study, we introduce an amplicon sequencing workflow, i.e., NanoAmpli-Seq, that builds on the intramolecular-ligated nanopore consensus sequencing (INC-Seq) approach and demonstrate its application for full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. NanoAmpli-Seq includes vital improvements to the INC-Seq protocol that reduces sample processing time while significantly improving sequence accuracy. The developed protocol includes chopSeq software for fragmentation and read orientation correction of INC-Seq consensus reads while nanoClust algorithm was designed for read partitioning-based de novo clustering and within cluster consensus calling to obtain accurate full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences. Conclusions: NanoAmpli-Seq accurately estimates the diversity of tested mock communities with average consensus sequence accuracy of 99.5% for 2D and 1D2 sequencing on the nanopore sequencing platform. Nearly all residual errors in NanoAmpli-Seq sequences originate from deletions in homopolymer regions, indicating that homopolymer aware base calling or error correction may allow for sequencing accuracy comparable to short-read sequencing platforms.","Bacteria; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Listeria; Microbiota; Nanopores; Reproducibility of Results; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; RNA 16S; bacterium; chemistry; DNA sequence; genetics; high throughput sequencing; Listeria; metabolism; microflora; nanopore; procedures; reproducibility","NLM (Medline)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058756664"

The aquaculture industry has recently been facing tremendous challenges in germplasm degeneration and poor disease resistance. As the yellow catfish exhibits notable sex dimorphism in growth, with adult males about two- to three-fold bigger than females, the way in which the aquaculture industry takes advantage of such sex dimorphism is another challenge. To address these issues, a high-quality reference genome of the yellow catfish would be a very useful resource. Findings: To construct a high-quality reference genome for the yellow catfish, we generated 51.2 Gb short reads and 38.9 Gb long reads using Illumina and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing platforms, respectively. The sequencing data were assembled into a 732.8 Mb genome assembly with a contig N50 length of 1.1 Mb. Additionally, we applied Hi-C technology to identify contacts among contigs, which were then used to assemble contigs into scaffolds, resulting in a genome assembly with 26 chromosomes and a scaffold N50 length of 25.8 Mb. Using 24,552 protein-coding genes annotated in the yellow catfish genome, the phylogenetic relationships of the yellow catfish with other teleosts showed that yellow catfish separated from the common ancestor of channel catfish ~81.9 million years ago. We identified 1,717 gene families to be expanded in the yellow catfish, and those gene families are mainly enriched in the immune system, signal transduction, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Conclusions: Taking advantage of Illumina, PacBio, and Hi-C technologies, we constructed the first high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly for the yellow catfish P. fulvidraco. The genomic resources generated in this work not only offer a valuable reference genome for functional genomics studies of yellow catfish to decipher the economic traits and sex determination but also provide important chromosome information for genome comparisons in the wider evolutionary research community. © 2018.

Detailed information on the cynomolgus macaque gut microbiota, the functional interplay between the gut microbiota and host physiology, and possible similarities to humans and other mammalians is very limited. The aim of this study was to construct the first cynomolgus macaque gut microbial gene catalog and compare this catalog to the human, pig, and mouse gut microbial gene catalogs. We performed metagenomic sequencing on fecal samples from 20 cynomolgus macaques and identified 1.9 million non-redundant bacterial genes of which 39.49% and 25.45% are present in the human and pig gut bacterial gene catalogs, respectively, whereas only 0.6% of the genes are present in the mouse gut bacterial gene catalog. By contrast, at the functional levels, more than 76% Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthologies are shared between the gut microbiota of all four mammalians. Thirty-two highly abundant bacterial genera could be defined as core genera of these mammalians. We demonstrated significant differences in the composition and functional potential of the gut microbiota as well as in the distribution of predicted bacterial phage sequences in cynomolgus macaques fed either a low-fat/high-fiber diet or a high-fat/low-fiber diet. Interestingly, the gut microbiota of cynomolgus macaques fed the high-fat/low-fiber diet became more similar to the gut microbiota of humans. © The Author(s) 2018.

There are many algorithms for performing clustering, and the results can vary substantially. In particular, the number of groups present in a dataset is often unknown, and the number of clusters identified by an algorithm can change based on the parameters used. To explore and examine the impact of varying clustering resolution, we present clustering trees. This visualization shows the relationships between clusters at multiple resolutions, allowing researchers to see how samples move as the number of clusters increases. In addition, meta-information can be overlaid on the tree to inform the choice of resolution and guide in identification of clusters. We illustrate the features of clustering trees using a series of simulations as well as two real examples, the classical iris dataset and a complex single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset.

These include Linked-Reads (Chromium, 10x Genomics), mate pairs (MP), long insert paired ends, and standard paired end. Data were assembled with the commercial DeNovoMAGIC assembly software, resulting in two assemblies, a traditional ""haploid"" assembly (Tur_tru_Illumina_hap_v1) that is a mosaic of the two parental haplotypes and a phased assembly (Tur_tru_Illumina_phased_v1) where each scaffold has sequence from a single homologous chromosome. We show that Tur_tru_Illumina_hap_v1 is more complete and more accurate compared to the current best reference based on the amount and composition of sequence, the consistency of the MP alignments to the assembled scaffolds, and on the analysis of conserved single-copy mammalian orthologs. The phased de novo assembly Tur_tru_Illumina_phased_v1 is the first publicly available for this species and provides the community with novel and accurate ways to explore the heterozygous nature of the dolphin genome. © 2019 The Author(s).

The degradation in quality and excessive fat accumulation in cultured C. idellus have long been attributed to possible alterations in the lipid metabolism of fish muscle tissues as a result of overnutrition from artificial diets. To investigate the effects of different diets on fish muscle quality, a large-scale metabolomics study was performed on 250 tails of C. idellus. Findings The experimental fish were divided into four groups based on sex and diet - female artificial feed (FAF), female grass feed, male artificial feed (MAF), and male grass feed (MGF). After a 113-day rearing period, the artificial feed (AF) group showed a significantly higher total mass of muscle fat (P < 0.01), with the FAF group being the highest. Metabolomics profiling based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed distinctive patterns of clustering according to the four groups. Overall, artificial feeding was associated with higher concentrations of docosapentaenoic acid, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid, whereas grass feeding was associated with elevated n-3 unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) such as eicosapentaenoic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, and gamma-linolenic acid. Artificial feeding also resulted in significant increased docosahexaenoic acid in MAF muscle than in MGF fish, whereas there was no significance in the comparison of female samples. Metabolic pathway analyses using both targeted and untargeted approaches consistently revealed that arachidonic acid metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways were significantly different between AF and grass fed groups. Conclusions Our results suggest that grass is a better source of dietary fatty acid and protein when compared to artificial feed. Grass feeding could effectively lower triglycerides in serum, reduce fat accumulation, and alter lipid compositions in fish muscle by increasing the concentrations of n-3 UFAs, leading to better nutrition and health. © The Author(s) 2018.

Eighty-eight percent of countries currently face a serious burden of malnutrition, especially in Africa and south and southeast Asia. About 95% of the food energy needs of humans are fulfilled by just 30 species, of which wheat, maize, and rice provide the majority of calories. Therefore, to diversify and stabilize the global food supply, enhance agricultural productivity, and tackle malnutrition, greater use of neglected or underutilized local plants (so-called orphan crops, but also including a few plants of special significance to agriculture, agroforestry, and nutrition) could be a partial solution. Results: Here, we present draft genome information for five agriculturally, biologically, medicinally, and economically important underutilized plants native to Africa: Vigna subterranea, Lablab purpureus, Faidherbia albida, Sclerocarya birrea, and Moringa oleifera. Assembled genomes range in size from 217 to 654 Mb. In V. subterranea, L. purpureus, F. albida, S. birrea, and M. oleifera, we have predicted 31,707, 20,946, 28,979, 18,937, and 18,451 protein-coding genes, respectively. By further analyzing the expansion and contraction of selected gene families, we have characterized root nodule symbiosis genes, transcription factors, and starch biosynthesis-related genes in these genomes. Conclusions: These genome data will be useful to identify and characterize agronomically important genes and understand their modes of action, enabling genomics-based, evolutionary studies, and breeding strategies to design faster, more focused, and predictable crop improvement programs. ©The Author(s) 2018.","Agriculture; Biosynthetic Pathways; Crops, Agricultural; Genes, Plant; Genome Size; Genome, Plant; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Open Reading Frames; Phylogeny; RNA, Untranslated; Species Specificity; Symbiosis; Time Factors; Transcription Factors; starch; transcription factor; untranslated RNA; African; agricultural procedures; agriculture; agroforestry; Article; biosynthesis; catering service; controlled study; crop; Faidherbia albida; genetic code; Lablab purpureus; malnutrition; Moringa oleifera; nonhuman; nutrition; plant genome; prediction; priority journal; Sclerocarya birrea; symbiosis; urban population; Vigna; Vigna subterranea; agriculture; crop; genetics; genome size; metabolism; molecular genetics; open reading frame; phylogeny; plant gene; species difference; time factor","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062617558"

While RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data contain information on such events, properly documented methods to extract them are lacking. Findings: To address this, we developed SL-quant, a fast and flexible pipeline that adapts to paired-end and single-end RNA-seq data and accurately quantifies SL trans-splicing events. It is designed to work downstream of read mapping and uses the reads left unmapped as primary input. Briefly, the SL sequences are identified with high specificity and are trimmed from the input reads, which are then remapped on the reference genome and quantified at the nucleotide position level (SL trans-splice sites) or at the gene level. Conclusions: SL-quant completes within 10 minutes on a basic desktop computer for typical C. elegans RNA-seq datasets and can be applied to other species as well. Validating the method, the SL trans-splice sites identified display the expected consensus sequence, and the results of the gene-level quantification are predictive of the gene position within operons. We also compared SL-quant to a recently published SL-containing read identification strategy that was found to be more sensitive but less specific than SL-quant. Both methods are implemented as a bash script available under the MIT license [1]. Full instructions for its installation, usage, and adaptation to other organisms are provided. © The Author(s) 2018.

However, some applications that contain time-consuming initialization steps will produce unnecessary costs for repeated executions. Findings: We demonstrate that hot-starting from containers that have been frozen after the application has already begun execution can speed up bioinformatics workflows by avoiding repetitive initialization steps. We use an open-source tool called Checkpoint and Restore in Userspace (CRIU) to save the state of the containers as a collection of checkpoint files on disk after it has read in the indices. The resulting checkpoint files are migrated to the host, and CRIU is used to regenerate the containers in that ready-to-run hot-start state. As a proof-of-concept example, we create a hot-start container for the spliced transcripts alignment to a reference (STAR) aligner and deploy this container to align RNA sequencing data. We compare the performance of the alignment step with and without checkpoints on cloud platforms using local and network disks. Conclusions: We demonstrate that hot-starting Docker containers from snapshots taken after repetitive initialization steps are completed significantly speeds up the execution of the STAR aligner on all experimental platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and local virtual machines. Our method can be potentially employed in other bioinformatics applications in which a checkpoint can be inserted after a repetitive initialization phase.","Asthma; Computational Biology; Humans; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; RNA Splicing; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Software; asthma; biology; drug effect; genetics; human; metabolism; procedures; RNA splicing; sequence analysis; smooth muscle cell; software","NLM (Medline)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055077376"

In this study, the draft genome of YO was assembled using a hybrid de novo assembly method that takes advantage of high-depth Illumina short reads (376.6X) and low-depth Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long reads (9.7X). Findings: The contig and scaffold NG50s of the hybrid de novo assembly were 362.3 Kbp and 16.8 Mbp, respectively. The completeness (97.6%) of the draft genome (Ogye 1.1) was evaluated with single-copy orthologous genes using Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs and found to be comparable to the current chicken reference genome (galGal5; 97.4%; contigs were assembled with high-depth PacBio long reads (50X) and scaffolded with short reads) and superior to other avian genomes (92%–93%; assembled with short read-only or hybrid methods). Compared to galGal4 and galGal5, the draft genome included 551 structural variations including the fibromelanosis (FM) locus duplication, related to hyperpigmentation. To comprehensively reconstruct transcriptome maps, RNA sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data were analyzed from 20 tissues, including 4 black tissues (skin, shank, comb, and fascia). The maps included 15,766 protein-coding and 6,900 long noncoding RNA genes, many of which were tissue-specifically expressed and displayed tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns in the promoter regions. Conclusions: We expect that the resulting genome sequence and transcriptome maps will be valuable resources for studying domestic chicken breeds, including black-skinned chickens, as well as for understanding genomic differences between breeds and the evolution of hyperpigmented chickens and functional elements related to hyperpigmentation. © The Author(s) 2018.

Previous standards have laid out guidelines sufficient to guarantee a certain quality of reporting; however, they set a high bar and as a consequence can be exhaustive and broad, thus limiting uptake. To help address this lack of uptake, we propose a reporting supplement - Minimum Information About a Mass Spectrometry Imaging Experiment (MIAMSIE) - and its abbreviated reporting standard version, MSIcheck. MIAMSIE is intended to improve author-driven reporting. It is intentionally not exhaustive, but is rather designed for extensibility and could therefore eventually become analogous to existing standards that aim to guarantee reporting quality. Conversely, its abbreviated form MSIcheck is intended as a diagnostic tool focused on key aspects in MSI reporting. We discuss how existing standards influenced MIAMSIE/MSIcheck and how these new approaches could positively impact reporting quality, followed by test implementation of both standards to demonstrate their use. For MIAMSIE, we report on author reviews of four articles and a dataset. For MSIcheck, we show a snapshot review of a one-month subset of the MSI literature that indicated issues with data provision and the reporting of both data analysis steps and calibration settings for MS systems. Although our contribution is MSI specific, we believe the underlying approach could be considered as a general strategy for improving scientific reporting. © The Author(s) 2018.

Although there are dozens of exome CNV detection methods available, these are often difficult to use, and accuracy varies unpredictably between and within datasets. Findings We present Ximmer, a tool that supports an end-to-end process for evaluating, tuning, and running analysis methods for detection of CNVs in germline samples. Ximmer includes a simulation framework, implementations of several commonly used CNV detection methods, and a visualization and curation tool that together enable interactive exploration and quality control of CNV results. Using Ximmer, we comprehensively evaluate CNV detection on four datasets using five different detection methods. We show that application of Ximmer can improve accuracy and aid in quality control of CNV detection results. In addition, Ximmer can be used to run analyses and explore CNV results in exome data.

This taxonomic complexity makes sequencing and assembling coral host genomes extremely challenging. Therefore, previous cnidarian genomic projects were based on symbiont-free tissue samples. However, this approach may not be applicable to the majority of cnidarian species for ecological reasons. We therefore evaluated the performance of an alternative method based on sequence binning for reconstructing the genome of the stony coral Porites rus from a hologenomic sample and compared it to traditional approaches. Results: Our results demonstrate that binning performs well for hologenomic data, producing sufficient reads for assembling the draft genome of P. rus. An assembly evaluation based on operational criteria showed results that were comparable to symbiont-free approaches in terms of completeness and usefulness, despite a high degree of fragmentation in our assembly. In addition, we found that binning provides sufficient data for exploratory k-mer estimation of genomic features, such as genome size and heterozygosity. Conclusions: Binning constitutes a powerful approach for disentangling taxonomically complex coral hologenomes. Considering the recent decline of coral reefs on the one hand and previous limitations to coral genome sequencing on the other hand, binning may facilitate rapid and reliable genome assembly. This study also provides an important milestone in advancing binning from the metagenomic to the hologenomic and from the prokaryotic to the eukaryotic level. © The Author(s) 2018.

The resulting chimeric transcripts are often endowed with oncogenic potential. Furthermore, they serve as diagnostic tools for the clinical classification of cancer subgroups with different prognosis and, in some cases, they can provide specific drug targets. To date, many efforts have been carried out to study gene fusion events occurring in tumor samples. In recent years, the availability of a comprehensive next-generation sequencing dataset for all existing human tumor cell lines has provided the opportunity to further investigate these data in order to identify novel and still uncharacterized gene fusion events. Results: In our work, we have extensively reanalyzed 935 paired-end RNA-sequencing experiments downloaded from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia repository, aiming at addressing novel putative cell-line specific gene fusion events in human malignancies. The bioinformatics analysis has been performed by the execution of four gene fusion detection algorithms. The results have been further prioritized by running a Bayesian classifier that makes an in silico validation. The collection of fusion events supported by all of the predictive software results in a robust set of ∼1,700 in silico predicted novel candidates suitable for downstream analyses. Given the huge amount of data and information produced, computational results have been systematized in a database named LiGeA. The database can be browsed through a dynamic and interactive web portal, further integrated with validated data from other well-known repositories. Taking advantage of the intuitive query forms, the users can easily access, navigate, filter, and select the putative gene fusions for further validations and studies. They can also find suitable experimental models for a given fusion of interest. Conclusions: We believe that the LiGeA resource can represent not only the first compendium of both known and putative novel gene fusion events in the catalog of all of the human malignant cell lines but it can also become a handy starting point for wet-lab biologists who wish to investigate novel cancer biomarkers and specific drug targets.","Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Computational Biology; Data Analysis; Data Mining; Databases, Genetic; Gene Fusion; Gene Rearrangement; Genome, Human; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Oncogene Fusion; Translocation, Genetic; Web Browser; biology; cell line; data analysis; data mining; gene fusion; gene rearrangement; gene translocation; genetic database; genomics; high throughput sequencing; human; human genome; procedures; tumor cell line; web browser","NLM (Medline)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055858553"

However, there are only a few data simulators that provide structural variants in silico and even fewer that provide variants with different allelic fraction and haplotypes. Findings: We developed SVEngine, an open-source tool to address this need. SVEngine simulates next-generation sequencing data with embedded structural variations. As input, SVEngine takes template haploid sequences (FASTA) and an external variant file, a variant distribution file, and/or a clonal phylogeny tree file (NEWICK) as input. Subsequently, it simulates and outputs sequence contigs (FASTAs), sequence reads (FASTQs), and/or post-alignment files (BAMs). All of the files contain the desired variants, along with BED files containing the ground truth. SVEngine’s flexible design process enables one to specify size, position, and allelic fraction for deletions, insertions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. Finally, SVEngine simulates sequence data that replicate the characteristics of a sequencing library with mixed sizes of DNA insert molecules. To improve the compute speed, SVEngine is highly parallelized to reduce the simulation time. Conclusions: We demonstrated the versatile features of SVEngine and its improved runtime comparisons with other available simulators. SVEngine’s features include the simulation of locus-specific variant frequency designed to mimic the phylogeny of cancer clonal evolution. We validated SVEngine’s accuracy by simulating genome-wide structural variants of NA12878 and a heterogeneous cancer genome. Our evaluation included checking various sequencing mapping features such as coverage change, read clipping, insert size shift, and neighboring hanging read pairs for representative variant types. Structural variant callers Lumpy and Manta and tumor heterogeneity estimator THetA2 were able to perform realistically on the simulated data.

In the superfamily Trombiculoidea (""chiggers""), the larvae feed preferentially on vertebrates, including humans. Species in the genus Leptotrombidium are vectors of a potentially fatal bacterial infection, scrub typhus, that affects 1 million people annually. Moreover, chiggers can cause pruritic dermatitis (trombiculiasis) in humans and domesticated animals. In the Trombidioidea (velvet mites), the larvae feed on other arthropods and are potential biological control agents for agricultural pests. Here, we present the first trombidid mites genomes, obtained both for a chigger, Leptotrombidium deliense, and for a velvet mite, Dinothrombium tinctorium. Results Sequencing was performed using Illumina technology. A 180 Mb draft assembly for D. tinctorium was generated from two paired-end and one mate-pair library using a single adult specimen. For L. deliense, a lower-coverage draft assembly (117 Mb) was obtained using pooled, engorged larvae with a single paired-end library. Remarkably, both genomes exhibited evidence of ancient lateral gene transfer from soil-derived bacteria or fungi. The transferred genes confer functions that are rare in animals, including terpene and carotenoid synthesis. Thirty-seven allergenic protein families were predicted in the L. deliense genome, of which nine were unique. Preliminary proteomic analyses identified several of these putative allergens in larvae. Conclusions Trombidid mite genomes appear to be more dynamic than those of other acariform mites. A priority for future research is to determine the biological function of terpene synthesis in this taxon and its potential for exploitation in disease control. © 2018 The Author(s).","Alkyl and Aryl Transferases; Allergens; Animals; Arthropod Proteins; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Fungal Proteins; Fungi; Gene Transfer, Horizontal; Genome; Larva; Mites; Opsins; Phylogeny; Salivary Proteins and Peptides; Secondary Metabolism; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Trombiculidae; allergen; carotenoid; terpene; allergen; arthropod protein; bacterial protein; fungal protein; opsin; saliva protein; terpene synthase; transferase; Article; biosynthesis; Dinothrombium tinctorium; gene function; gene sequence; genetic association; genome; genome size; horizontal gene transfer; Leptotrombidium; Leptotrombidium deliense; mite; multigene family; nonhuman; priority journal; protein determination; protein expression; protein family; proteomics; secondary metabolism; animal; bacterium; classification; fungus; genetics; growth, development and aging; high performance liquid chromatography; horizontal gene transfer; immunology; larva; metabolism; mite; phylogeny; secondary metabolism; tandem mass spectrometry; Trombiculidae","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059794955"

The research field is dynamic and expanding with applications across biomedical, biotechnological, and many other applied biological domains. Its computationally intensive nature has driven requirements for open data formats, data repositories, and data analysis tools. However, the rapid progress has resulted in a mosaic of independent, and sometimes incompatible, analysis methods that are difficult to connect into a useful and complete data analysis solution. Findings: PhenoMeNal (Phenome and Metabolome aNalysis) is an advanced and complete solution to set up Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) that brings workflow-oriented, interoperable metabolomics data analysis platforms into the cloud. PhenoMeNal seamlessly integrates a wide array of existing open-source tools that are tested and packaged as Docker containers through the project's continuous integration process and deployed based on a kubernetes orchestration framework. It also provides a number of standardized, automated, and published analysis workflows in the user interfaces Galaxy, Jupyter, Luigi, and Pachyderm. Conclusions: PhenoMeNal constitutes a keystone solution in cloud e-infrastructures available for metabolomics. PhenoMeNal is a unique and complete solution for setting up cloud e-infrastructures through easy-to-use web interfaces that can be scaled to any custom public and private cloud environment. By harmonizing and automating software installation and configuration and through ready-to-use scientific workflow user interfaces, PhenoMeNal has succeeded in providing scientists with workflow-driven, reproducible, and shareable metabolomics data analysis platforms that are interfaced through standard data formats, representative datasets, versioned, and have been tested for reproducibility and interoperability. The elastic implementation of PhenoMeNal further allows easy adaptation of the infrastructure to other application areas and 'omics research domains.  © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

Restricted access to much individual-level phenotype data makes it difficult to estimate large-scale phenotypic correlation across the human phenome. Two state-of-the-art methods, metaCCA and LD score regression, provide an alternative approach to estimate phenotypic correlation using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary results. Results: Here, we present an integrated R toolkit, PhenoSpD, to use LD score regression to estimate phenotypic correlations using GWAS summary statistics and to utilize the estimated phenotypic correlations to inform correction of multiple testing for complex human traits using the spectral decomposition of matrices (SpD). The simulations suggest that it is possible to identify nonindependence of phenotypes using samples with partial overlap; as overlap decreases, the estimated phenotypic correlations will attenuate toward zero and multiple testing correction will be more stringent than in perfectly overlapping samples. Also, in contrast to LD score regression, metaCCA will provide approximate genetic correlations rather than phenotypic correlation, which limits its application for multiple testing correction. In a case study, PhenoSpD using UK Biobank GWAS results suggested 399.6 independent tests among 487 human traits, which is close to the 352.4 independent tests estimated using true phenotypic correlation. We further applied PhenoSpD to an estimated 5,618 pair-wise phenotypic correlations among 107 metabolites using GWAS summary statistics from Kettunen's publication and PhenoSpD suggested the equivalent of 33.5 independent tests for these metabolites. Conclusions: PhenoSpD extends the use of summary-level results, providing a simple and conservative way to reduce dimensionality for complex human traits using GWAS summary statistics. This is particularly valuable in the age of large-scale biobank and consortia studies, where GWAS results are much more accessible than individual-level data.","Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Linkage Disequilibrium; Models, Genetic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Software; biological model; gene linkage disequilibrium; genome-wide association study; human; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; software","NLM (Medline)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055073225"

Indeed, this is essential for controlled comparison between different observations and for the wider dissemination of workflows. However, providing this type of reproducibility and traceability is often complicated by the need to accommodate the myriad dependencies included in a larger body of software, each of which generally comes in various versions. Moreover, in many fields (bioinformatics being a prime example), these versions are subject to continual change due to rapidly evolving technologies, further complicating problems related to reproducibility. Here, we propose a principled approach for building analysis pipelines and managing their dependencies with GNU Guix. As a case study to demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present a set of highly reproducible pipelines called PiGx for the analysis of RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, bisulfite-treated DNA sequencing, and single-cell resolution RNA sequencing. All pipelines process raw experimental data and generate reports containing publication-ready plots and figures, with interactive report elements and standard observables. Users may install these highly reproducible packages and apply them to their own datasets without any special computational expertise beyond the use of the command line. We hope such a toolkit will provide immediate benefit to laboratory workers wishing to process their own datasets or bioinformaticians seeking to automate all, or parts of, their analyses. In the long term, we hope our approach to reproducibility will serve as a blueprint for reproducible workflows in other areas.

It is essential to take into consideration atypical regions, trends (e.g., origin of replication), or known and unknown biases that influence coverage. It is also important that reported events have robust statistics (e.g. z-score) associated with their detections as well as precise location. Results We provide a stand-alone application, sequana_coverage, that reports genomic regions of interest (ROIs) that are significantly over-or underrepresented in high-throughput sequencing data. Significance is associated with the events as well as characteristics such as length of the regions. The algorithm first detrends the data using an efficient running median algorithm. It then estimates the distribution of the normalized genome coverage with a Gaussian mixture model. Finally, a z-score statistic is assigned to each base position and used to separate the central distribution from the ROIs (i.e., under-and overcovered regions). A double thresholds mechanism is used to cluster the genomic ROIs. HTML reports provide a summary with interactive visual representations of the genomic ROIs with standard plots and metrics. Genomic variations such as single-nucleotide variants or CNVs can be effectively identified at the same time. © 2018 The Author(s).","Algorithms; Bacteria; DNA Copy Number Variations; Fungi; Genetic Variation; Genome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Viruses; article; copy number variation; genome; high throughput sequencing; running; single nucleotide polymorphism; algorithm; bacterium; copy number variation; fungus; genetic variation; genetics; virus","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059799170"

High demand coupled with deforestation have caused a decrease in natural teak forests, and future supplies will be reliant on teak plantations. Hence, selection of teak tree varieties for clonal propagation with superior growth performance is of great importance, and access to high-quality genetic and genomic resources can accelerate the selection process by identifying genes underlying desired traits. Findings To facilitate teak research and variety improvement, we generated a highly contiguous, chromosomal-scale genome assembly using high-coverage Pacific Biosciences long reads coupled with high-throughput chromatin conformation capture. Of the 18 teak chromosomes, we generated 17 near-complete pseudomolecules with one chromosome present as two chromosome arm scaffolds. Genome annotation yielded 31,168 genes encoding 46,826 gene models, of which, 39,930 and 41,155 had Pfam domain and expression evidence, respectively. We identified 14 clusters of tandem-duplicated terpene synthases (TPSs), genes central to the biosynthesis of terpenes, which are involved in plant defense and pollinator attraction. Transcriptome analysis revealed 10 TPSs highly expressed in woody tissues, of which, 8 were in tandem, revealing the importance of resolving tandemly duplicated genes and the quality of the assembly and annotation. We also validated the enzymatic activity of four TPSs to demonstrate the function of key TPSs. Conclusions In summary, this high-quality chromosomal-scale assembly and functional annotation of the teak genome will facilitate the discovery of candidate genes related to traits critical for sustainable production of teak and for anti-insecticidal natural products. © 2019 The Author(s).

This tree's seed is valued for its high content of precious fatty acids (especially nervonic acid). However, studies on its genetic makeup and fatty acid biogenesis are severely hampered by a lack of molecular and genetic tools. Findings: We generated 51 Gb and 135 Gb of raw DNA sequences, using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) single-molecule real-Time and 10× Genomics sequencing, respectively. A final genome assembly, with a scaffold N50 size of 4.65 Mb and a total length of 1.51 Gb, was obtained by primary assembly based on PacBio long reads plus scaffolding with 10× Genomics reads. Identified repeats constituted ∼82% of the genome, and 24,064 protein-coding genes were predicted with high support. The genome has low heterozygosity and shows no evidence for recent whole genome duplication. Metabolic pathway genes relating to the accumulation of long-chain fatty acid were identified and studied in detail. Conclusions: Here, we provide the first genome assembly and gene annotation for M. oleifera. The availability of these resources will be of great importance for conservation biology and for the functional genomics of nervonic acid biosynthesis.  © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Genomic resequencing provides a powerful means for the direct identification of trait-associated sequence variations that underlie molecular mechanisms of domestication. Results: Here, we report our effort to define such variations based on data from domestic goat breeds (Capra aegagrus hircus; five each) selected for dairy, cashmere, and meat production in reference to their wild ancestors, the Sindh ibex (Capra aegagrus blythi; two) and the Markhor (Capra falconeri; two). Using ∼24 million high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), ∼1.9 million insertions/deletions, and 2,317 copy number variations, we define SNP-desert-associated genes (SAGs), domestic-associated genes (DAGs), and trait-associated genes (TAGs) and attempt to associate them with quantitative trait loci (QTL), domestication, and agronomic traits. A greater majority of SAGs shared by all domestic breeds are classified into Gene Ontology categories of metabolism and cell cycle. DAGs, together with some SAGs, are most relevant to behavior, immunity, and trait specificity. Whereas, TAGs such as growth differentiation factor 5 and fibroblast growth factor 5 for bone and hair growth, respectively, appear to be directly involved in growth regulation.

Compared to the number of available sequences, not only is the repertoire of the experimentally determined structures of holo-proteins limited, these structures do not always include pharmacologically relevant compounds at their binding sites. In addition, binding affinity databases provide vast quantities of information on interactions between drug-like molecules and their targets, however, often lacking structural data. On that account, there is a need for computational methods to complement existing repositories by constructing the atomic-level models of drug-protein assemblies that will not be determined experimentally in the near future. Results: We created eModel-BDB, a database of  200,005 comparative models of drug-bound proteins based on   1,391,403 interaction data obtained from the Binding Database and the PDB library of 31 January 2017. Complex models in eModel-BDB were generated with a collection of the state-of-the-art techniques, including protein meta-threading, template-based structure modeling, refinement and binding site detection, and ligand similarity-based docking. In addition to a rigorous quality control maintained during dataset generation, a subset of weakly homologous models was selected for the retrospective validation against experimental structural data recently deposited to the Protein Data Bank. Validation results indicate that eModel-BDB contains models that are accurate not only at the global protein structure level but also with respect to the atomic details of bound ligands. Conclusions: Freely available eModel-BDB can be used to support structure-based drug discovery and repositioning, drug target identification, and protein structure determination.","Binding Sites; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Drug Discovery; Humans; Ligands; Protein Conformation; Sequence Analysis, Protein; ligand; binding site; biology; drug development; human; procedures; protein conformation; protein database; sequence analysis","NLM (Medline)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055075094"

As such, there is an urgent need to identify novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and to develop novel therapies. The availability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from tumors of liver cancer patients has provided us with invaluable resources to better understand HCC through the integration of data from different sources to facilitate the identification of promising biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Findings: Here, we review key insights gleaned from more than 20 NGS studies of HCC tumor samples, comprising approximately 582 whole genomes and 1,211 whole exomes mainly from the East Asian population. Through consolidation of reported somatic mutations from multiple studies, we identified genes with different types of somatic mutations, including single nucleotide variations, insertion/deletions, structural variations, and copy number alterations as well as genes with multiple frequent viral integration. Pathway analysis showed that this curated list of somatic mutations is critically involved in cancer-related pathways, viral carcinogenesis, and signaling pathways. Lastly, we addressed the future directions of HCC research as more NGS datasets become available. Conclusions: Our review is a comprehensive resource for the current NGS research in HCC, consolidating published articles, potential gene candidates, and their related biological pathways.","Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genomics; Hepatitis B; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Mutation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; complication; gene expression regulation; genetic predisposition; genetics; genomics; hepatitis B; high throughput sequencing; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; mutation; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; virology","NLM (Medline)","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058738791"

However, the lack of reference genome sequences is a major obstacle for basic and applied biology on rattan. Findings: We produced two chromosome-level genome assemblies of C. simplicifolius and D. jenkinsiana using Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, and Hi-C sequencing data. A total of ∼730 Gb and ∼682 Gb of raw data covered the predicted genome lengths (∼1.98 Gb of C. simplicifolius and ∼1.61 Gb of D. jenkinsiana) to ∼372 × and ∼426 × read depths, respectively. The two de novo genome assemblies, ∼1.94 Gb and ∼1.58 Gb, were generated with scaffold N50s of ∼160 Mb and ∼119 Mb in C. simplicifolius and D. jenkinsiana, respectively. The C. simplicifolius and D. jenkinsiana genomes were predicted to harbor 51,235 and 53,342 intact protein-coding gene models, respectively. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs evaluation demonstrated that genome completeness reached 96.4% and 91.3% in the C. simplicifolius and D. jenkinsiana genomes, respectively. Genome evolution showed that four Arecaceae plants clustered together, and the divergence time between the two rattans was ∼19.3 million years ago. Additionally, we identified 193 and 172 genes involved in the lignin biosynthesis pathway in the C. simplicifolius and D. jenkinsiana genomes, respectively. Conclusions: We present the first de novo assemblies of two rattan genomes (C. simplicifolius and D. jenkinsiana). These data will not only provide a fundamental resource for functional genomics, particularly in promoting germplasm utilization for breeding, but also serve as reference genomes for comparative studies between and among different species. © 2018 Oxford University Press.

Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been applied as a live vaccine for immunization against smallpox, which was eradicated by 1980 as a result of worldwide vaccination. VACV is the prototype of poxviruses in the investigation of the molecular pathogenesis of the virus. Short-read sequencing methods have revolutionized transcriptomics; however, they are not efficient in distinguishing between the RNA isoforms and transcript overlaps. Long-read sequencing (LRS) is much better suited to solve these problems and also allow direct RNA sequencing. Despite the scientific relevance of VACV, no LRS data have been generated for the viral transcriptome to date. Findings: For the deep characterization of the VACV RNA profile, various LRS platforms and library preparation approaches were applied. The raw reads were mapped to the VACV reference genome and also to the host (Chlorocebus sabaeus) genome. In this study, we applied the Pacific Biosciences RSII and Sequel platforms, which altogether resulted in 937,531 mapped reads of inserts (1.42 Gb), while we obtained 2,160,348 aligned reads (1.75 Gb) from the different library preparation methods using the MinION device from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Conclusions: By applying cutting-edge technologies, we were able to generate a large dataset that can serve as a valuable resource for the investigation of the dynamic VACV transcriptome, the virus-host interactions, and RNA base modifications. These data can provide useful information for novel gene annotations in the VACV genome. Our dataset can also be used to analyze the currently available LRS platforms, library preparation methods, and bioinformatics pipelines.","Animals; Cell Line; Cercopithecus aethiops; Databases, Genetic; Fibroblasts; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Library; Humans; RNA Splicing; RNA, Viral; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Transcriptome; Vaccinia virus; transcriptome; virus RNA; animal; cell line; chemistry; Chlorocebus aethiops; cytology; DNA sequence; fibroblast; gene expression profiling; gene library; genetic database; genetics; human; metabolism; procedures; RNA splicing; Vaccinia virus; virology","NLM (Medline)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058609345"

Findings: GOtrack gives users access to gene- and term-level information on annotations for nine model organisms as well as an interactive tool that measures the stability of enrichment results over time for user-provided ""hit lists"" of genes. To document the effects of GO evolution on enrichment, we analyzed more than 2,500 published hit lists of human genes (most older than 9 years ); 53% of hit lists were considered to yield significantly stable enrichment results. Conclusions: Because stability is far from assured for any individual hit list, GOtrack can lead to more informed and cautious application of GO to genomics research.","Animals; Eukaryota; Gene Ontology; Genomics; Humans; Molecular Sequence Annotation; animal; eukaryote; gene ontology; genetics; genomics; human; molecular genetics; procedures; trends","NLM (Medline)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055071930"

Yet, inferences from metagenomic studies are often limited by dataset size and complexity and are restricted by the availability and completeness of existing databases. De novo comparative metagenomics enables the comparison of metagenomes based on their total genetic content. Results We developed a tool called Libra that performs an all-vs-All comparison of metagenomes for precise clustering based on their k-mer content. Libra uses a scalable Hadoop framework for massive metagenome comparisons, Cosine Similarity for calculating the distance using sequence composition and abundance while normalizing for sequencing depth, and a web-based implementation in iMicrobe (http://imicrobe.us) that uses the CyVerse advanced cyberinfrastructure to promote broad use of the tool by the scientific community. Conclusions A comparison of Libra to equivalent tools using both simulated and real metagenomic datasets, ranging from 80 million to 4.2 billion reads, reveals that methods commonly implemented to reduce compute time for large datasets, such as data reduction, read count normalization, and presence/absence distance metrics, greatly diminish the resolution of large-scale comparative analyses. In contrast, Libra uses all of the reads to calculate k-mer abundance in a Hadoop architecture that can scale to any size dataset to enable global-scale analyses and link microbial signatures to biological processes. © © The Author(s) 2018.

It is characterized by self-generated motor action controlling the accessibility and processing of sensory information. In rodents, active sensing is commonly studied in the whisker system. As rats and mice modulate their whisking contextually, they employ frequency and amplitude modulation. Understanding the development, mechanisms, and plasticity of adaptive motor control will require precise behavioral measurements of whisker position. Findings Advances in high-speed videography and analytical methods now permit collection and systematic analysis of large datasets. Here, we provide 6,642 videos as freely moving juvenile (third to fourth postnatal week) and adult rodents explore a stationary object on the gap-crossing task. The dataset includes sensory exploration with single-or multi-whiskers in wild-type animals, serotonin transporter knockout rats, rats received pharmacological intervention targeting serotonergic signaling. The dataset includes varying background illumination conditions and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), ranging from homogenous/high contrast to non-homogenous/low contrast. A subset of videos has been whisker and nose tracked and are provided as reference for image processing algorithms. Conclusions The recorded behavioral data can be directly used to study development of sensorimotor computation, top-down mechanisms that control sensory navigation and whisker position, and cross-species comparison of active sensing. It could also help to address contextual modulation of active sensing during touch-induced whisking in head-fixed vs freely behaving animals. Finally, it provides the necessary data for machine learning approaches for automated analysis of sensory and motion parameters across a wide variety of signal-to-noise ratios with accompanying human observer-determined ground-truth. © 2018 The Author(s).","Algorithms; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Databases, Factual; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Rats; Rats, Transgenic; Rats, Wistar; Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Vibrissae; Video Recording; serotonin transporter; serotonin transporter; Slc6a4 protein, rat; algorithm; animal behavior; animal experiment; Article; data base; image processing; information processing; machine learning; motion; nonhuman; online system; priority journal; sensorimotor function; signal noise ratio; tactile stimulation; task performance; validity; vibrissa; videorecording; animal; C57BL mouse; computer assisted diagnosis; deficiency; factual database; genetics; male; mouse; physiology; rat; transgenic rat; Wistar rat","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058594112"

However, when a reference for the sequenced species is not available, alternatives include using a reference genome from a related species or reconstructing transcript sequences with de novo assembly. In addition, researchers are faced with many options for RNA-seq data processing and limited information on how their decisions will impact the final outcome. Using both a diploid and polyploid species with a distant reference genome, we have tested the influence of different tools at various steps of a typical RNA-seq analysis workflow on the recovery of useful processed data available for downstream analysis. Findings At the preprocessing step, we found error correction has a strong influence on de novo assembly but not on mapping results. After trimming, a greater percentage of reads could be used in downstream analysis by selecting gentle quality trimming performed with Skewer instead of strict quality trimming with Trimmomatic. This availability of reads correlated with size, quality, and completeness of de novo assemblies and with number of mapped reads. When selecting a reference genome from a related species to map reads, outcome was significantly improved when using mapping software tolerant of greater sequence divergence, such as Stampy or GSNAP. Conclusions The selection of bioinformatic software tools for RNA-seq data analysis can maximize quality parameters on de novo assemblies and availability of reads in downstream analysis. © 2018 The Author(s).","Blueberry Plants; Chromosome Mapping; Cluster Analysis; Databases, Genetic; Diploidy; Gene Library; Genomics; Plant Roots; Polyploidy; RNA, Plant; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Software; Transcriptome; plant RNA; transcriptome; article; data analysis; diploidy; genome; human; pipeline; polyploidy; RNA sequence; software; workflow; blueberry; chemistry; chromosomal mapping; cluster analysis; diploidy; gene library; genetic database; genetics; genomics; metabolism; plant root; polyploidy; procedures; sequence analysis","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059797923"

Nucleobase transporters are also evaluated as potential targets for antimicrobial therapies, since several pathogenic microorganisms rely on purine/pyrimidine salvage from their hosts. The majority of known nucleobase transporters belong to the evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitous nucleobase-ascorbate transporter/nucleobase-cation symporter-2 (NAT/NCS2) protein family. Based on a large-scale phylogenetic analysis that we performed on thousands of prokaryotic proteomes, we developed a webserver that can detect and distinguish this family of transporters from other homologous families that recognize different substrates. We can further categorize these transporters to certain evolutionary groups with distinct substrate preferences. The webserver scans whole proteomes and graphically displays which proteins are identified as NAT/NCS2, to which evolutionary groups and subgroups they belong to, and which conserved motifs they have. For key subgroups and motifs, the server displays annotated information from published crystal-structures and mutational studies pointing to key functional amino acids that may help experts assess the transport capability of the target sequences. The server is 100% accurate in detecting NAT/NCS2 family members. We also used the server to analyze 9,109 prokaryotic proteomes and identified Clostridia, Bacilli, β- and γ-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria as the taxa with the largest number of NAT/NCS2 transporters per proteome. An analysis of 120 representative eukaryotic proteomes also demonstrates the server's capability of correctly analyzing this major lineage, with plants emerging as the group with the highest number of NAT/NCS2 members per proteome.","Archaea; Archaeal Proteins; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Biological Evolution; Cluster Analysis; Databases, Factual; Markov Chains; Plant Proteins; Plants; Proteome; Symporters; User-Computer Interface; archaeal protein; bacterial protein; cotransporter; plant protein; proteome; archaeon; bacterium; chemistry; classification; cluster analysis; computer interface; evolution; factual database; Markov chain; metabolism; plant","NLM (Medline)","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059252502"

Therefore, there is an urgent need for highly scalable and powerful computational systems. Among the state-of-the-art parallel computing platforms, Apache Spark is a fast, general-purpose, in-memory, iterative computing framework for large-scale data processing that ensures high fault tolerance and high scalability by introducing the resilient distributed dataset abstraction. In terms of performance, Spark can be up to 100 times faster in terms of memory access and 10 times faster in terms of disk access than Hadoop. Moreover, it provides advanced application programming interfaces in Java, Scala, Python, and R. It also supports some advanced components, including Spark SQL for structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for computing graphs, and Spark Streaming for stream computing. We surveyed Spark-based applications used in next-generation sequencing and other biological domains, such as epigenetics, phylogeny, and drug discovery. The results of this survey are used to provide a comprehensive guideline allowing bioinformatics researchers to apply Spark in their own fields. © 2018 Oxford University Press.

Gemsbok are heterothermic and thus highly adapted to live in the desert, changing their feeding behavior when faced with extreme drought and heat. A high-quality genome sequence of this species will assist efforts to elucidate these and other important traits of gemsbok and facilitate research on conservation efforts. Findings Using 180 Gbp of Illumina paired-end and mate-pair reads, a 2.9 Gbp assembly with scaffold N50 of 1.48 Mbp was generated using SOAPdenovo. Scaffolds were extended using Chicago library sequencing, which yielded an additional 114.7 Gbp of DNA sequence. The HiRise assembly using SOAPdenovo + Chicago library sequencing produced a scaffold N50 of 47 Mbp and a final genome size of 2.9 Gbp, representing 90.6% of the estimated genome size and including 93.2% of expected genes according to Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs analysis. The Reference-Assisted Chromosome Assembly tool was used to generate a final set of 47 predicted chromosome fragments with N50 of 86.25 Mbp and containing 93.8% of expected genes.

We analyzed the gut microbiome of 110 healthy individuals from two distinct locations (North-Central and Southern) in India using multi-omics approaches, including 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and metabolomic profiling of fecal and serum samples. Results The gene catalogue established in this study emphasizes the uniqueness of the Indian gut microbiome in comparison to other populations. The gut microbiome of the cohort from North-Central India, which was primarily consuming a plant-based diet, was found to be associated with Prevotella and also showed an enrichment of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathways. In contrast, the gut microbiome of the cohort from Southern India, which was consuming an omnivorous diet, showed associations with Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, and Faecalibacterium and had an enrichment of short chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and BCAA transporters. This corroborated well with the metabolomics results, which showed higher concentration of BCAAs in the serum metabolome of the North-Central cohort and an association with Prevotella. In contrast, the concentration of BCAAs was found to be higher in the fecal metabolome of the Southern-India cohort and showed a positive correlation with the higher abundance of BCAA transporters. Conclusions The study reveals the unique composition of the Indian gut microbiome, establishes the Indian gut microbial gene catalogue, and compares it with the gut microbiome of other populations. The functional associations revealed using metagenomic and metabolomic approaches provide novel insights on the gut-microbe-metabolic axis, which will be useful for future epidemiological and translational researches. © 2019 The Author(s).

Including multiple hidden layers in artificial neural networks enables unprecedented predictive power; however, the proper training of deep neural networks requires thousands of exemplars. Collecting this amount of data is not feasible in typical neuroimaging experiments. A handy solution to this problem, which has largely fallen outside the scope of deep learning applications in neuroimaging, is to repurpose deep networks that have already been trained on large datasets by fine-tuning them to target datasets/tasks with fewer exemplars. Here, we investigated how this method, called transfer learning, can aid age category classification and regression based on brain functional connectivity patterns derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We trained a connectome-convolutional neural network on a larger public dataset and then examined how the knowledge learned can be used effectively to perform these tasks on smaller target datasets collected with a different type of scanner and/or imaging protocol and pre-processing pipeline. Results Age classification on the target datasets benefitted from transfer learning. Significant improvement (∼9%-13% increase in accuracy) was observed when the convolutional layers' weights were initialized based on the values learned on the public dataset and then fine-tuned to the target datasets. Transfer learning also appeared promising in improving the otherwise poor prediction of chronological age. Conclusions Transfer learning is a plausible solution to adapt convolutional neural networks to neuroimaging data with few exemplars and different data acquisition and pre-processing protocols. © 2018 The Author(s).","Aging; Brain; Databases, Factual; Deep Learning; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks (Computer); accuracy; adult; age; aged; Article; artificial neural network; classification; clinical protocol; connectome; controlled study; convolutional neural network; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; information processing; male; prediction; priority journal; transfer of learning; aging; brain; diagnostic imaging; factual database; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058601196"

Approximately 50 Paragonimus species have been reported to infect animals and humans, but Paragonimus westermani is responsible for the bulk of human disease. Despite their medical and economic importance, no genome sequence for any Paragonimus species is available. Results: We sequenced and assembled the genome of P. westermani, which is among the largest of the known pathogen genomes with an estimated size of 1.1 Gb. A 922.8 Mb genome assembly was generated from Illumina and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequence data, covering 84% of the estimated genome size. The genome has a high proportion (45%) of repeat-derived DNA, particularly of the long interspersed element and long terminal repeat subtypes, and the expansion of these elements may explain some of the large size. We predicted 12,852 protein coding genes, showing a high level of conservation with related trematode species. The majority of proteins (80%) had homologs in the human liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini, with an average sequence identity of 64.1%. Assembly of the P. westermani mitochondrial genome from long PacBio reads resulted in a single high-quality circularized 20.6 kb contig. The contig harbored a 6.9 kb region of non-coding repetitive DNA comprised of three distinct repeat units. Our results suggest that the region is highly polymorphic in P. westermani, possibly even within single worm isolates. Conclusions: The generated assembly represents the first Paragonimus genome sequence and will facilitate future molecular studies of this important, but neglected, parasite group. © The Author(s) 2019.","Animals; Genome Size; Genome, Helminth; Genome, Mitochondrial; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Paragonimus westermani; Phylogeny; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Whole Genome Sequencing; proteome; transcriptome; Article; Clonorchis sinensis; DNA base composition; DNA isolation; DNA polymorphism; Fasciola hepatica; genetic code; genetic conservation; genetic variability; genome size; human; long interspersed repeat; long terminal repeat; microbial genome; mitochondrial genome; nonhuman; Opisthorchis viverrini; paragonimiasis; Paragonimus westermani; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; prediction; priority journal; protein function; sequence alignment; sequence homology; whole genome sequencing; animal; genetics; genome; high throughput sequencing; molecular genetics; Paragonimus westermani; procedures; whole genome sequencing","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060052251"

Genetic incompatibilities were observed between lacertid populations through crossing experiments, which led to the delineation of two separate species within the L. viridis complex. The population history of these sister species and processes driving divergence are unknown. We constructed the first high-quality de novo genome assemblies for both L. viridis and L. bilineata through Illumina and PacBio sequencing, with annotation support provided from transcriptome sequencing of several tissues. To estimate gene flow between the two species and identify factors involved in reproductive isolation, we studied their evolutionary history, identified genomic rearrangements, detected signatures of selection on non-coding RNA, and on protein-coding genes. Findings: Here we show that gene flow was primarily unidirectional from L. bilineata to L. viridis after their split at least 1.15 million years ago. We detected positive selection of the non-coding repertoire; mutations in transcription factors; accumulation of divergence through inversions; selection on genes involved in neural development, reproduction, and behavior, as well as in ultraviolet-response, possibly driven by sexual selection, whose contribution to reproductive isolation between these lacertid species needs to be further evaluated. Conclusion: The combination of short and long sequence reads resulted in one of the most complete lizard genome assemblies. The characterization of a diverse array of genomic features provided valuable insights into the demographic history of divergence among European green lizards, as well as key species differences, some of which are candidates that could have played a role in speciation. In addition, our study generated valuable genomic resources that can be used to address conservation-related issues in lacertids.  © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

Predicting plant biomass is regarded as a key purpose for plant breeders and ecologists. However, it is a great challenge to find a predictive biomass model across experiments. Results: In the present study, we constructed 4 predictive models to examine the quantitative relationship between image-based features and plant biomass accumulation. Our methodology has been applied to 3 consecutive barley (Hordeum vulgare) experiments with control and stress treatments. The results proved that plant biomass can be accurately predicted from image-based parameters using a random forest model. The high prediction accuracy based on this model will contribute to relieving the phenotyping bottleneck in biomass measurement in breeding applications. The prediction performance is still relatively high across experiments under similar conditions. The relative contribution of individual features for predicting biomass was further quantified, revealing new insights into the phenotypic determinants of the plant biomass outcome. Furthermore, methods could also be used to determine the most important image-based features related to plant biomass accumulation, which would be promising for subsequent genetic mapping to uncover the genetic basis of biomass. Conclusions: We have developed quantitative models to accurately predict plant biomass accumulation from image data. We anticipate that the analysis results will be useful to advance our views of the phenotypic determinants of plant biomass outcome, and the statistical methods can be broadly used for other plant species. © The Author(s) 2018.","Algorithms; Biomass; Crops, Agricultural; Decision Trees; Droughts; Hordeum; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Phenotype; Stress, Physiological; Article; barley; bioaccumulation; biomass; bottleneck population; controlled study; DNA methylation; dry weight; fresh weight; gene mapping; genetic variation; image analysis; image processing; mathematical model; nonhuman; phenotype; plant biomass; plant breeding; plant stress; prediction; priority journal; quantitative analysis; quantitative genetics; random forest; random forest model; algorithm; anatomy and histology; biomass; crop; decision tree; drought; Hordeum; physiological stress; physiology; procedures; statistics and numerical data; three dimensional imaging","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046106591"

Cantharidin and its derivatives have been used to treat cancers such as liver, stomach, lung, and esophageal cancers. Hycleus cichorii and Hycleus phaleratus are the most commercially important blister beetles in China due to their ability to biosynthesize this potent vesicant. However, there is a lack of genome reference, which has hindered development of studies on the biosynthesis of cantharidin and a better understanding of its biology and pharmacology. Results: We report 2 draft genomes and quantified gene sets for the blister beetles H. cichorii and H. phaleratus, 2 complex genomes with > 72% repeats and approximately 1% heterozygosity, using Illumina sequencing data. An integrated assembly pipeline was performed for assembly, and most of the coding regions were obtained. Benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCO) assessment showed that our assembly obtained more than 98% of the Endopterygota universal single-copy orthologs. Comparison analysis showed that the completeness of coding genes in our assembly was comparable to other beetle genomes such as Dendroctonus ponderosae and Agrilus planipennis. Gene annotation yielded 13 813 and 13 725 protein-coding genes in H. cichorii and H. phaleratus, of which approximately 89% were functionally annotated. BUSCO assessment showed that approximately 86% and 84% of the Endopterygota universal single-copy orthologs were annotated completely in these 2 gene sets, whose completeness is comparable to that of D. ponderosae and A. planipennis. Conclusions: Assembly of both blister beetle genomes provides a valuable resource for future biosynthesis of cantharidin and comparative genomic studies of blister beetles and other beetles. © The Author(s) 2018.","Animals; Cantharidin; Coleoptera; Genome, Insect; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Sequence Analysis, DNA; genomic DNA; cantharidin; adult; Agrilus planipennis; China; controlled study; Curculionidae; Dendroctonus ponderosae; gene library; gene number; gene sequence; genome; genome size; heterozygosity; Hycleus cichorii; Hycleus phaleratus; limit of quantitation; male; Meloidae; nonhuman; Note; open reading frame; phylogenetic tree; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; retroposon; transposon; animal; beetle; DNA sequence; genetics; insect genome; metabolism; molecular genetics; procedures","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050737901"

Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) and mothur have been the most widely used taxonomic analysis tools for this purpose, with MAPseq and QIIME 2 being two recently released alternatives. However, no independent and direct comparison between these four main tools has been performed. Here, we compared the default classifiers of MAPseq, mothur, QIIME, and QIIME 2 using synthetic simulated datasets comprised of some of the most abundant genera found in the human gut, ocean, and soil environments. We evaluate their accuracy when paired with both different reference databases and variable sub-regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Findings: We show that QIIME 2 provided the best recall and F-scores at genus and family levels, together with the lowest distance estimates between the observed and simulated samples. However, MAPseq showed the highest precision, with miscall rates consistently <2%. Notably, QIIME 2 was the most computationally expensive tool, with CPU time and memory usage almost 2 and 30 times higher than MAPseq, respectively. Using the SILVA database generally yielded a higher recall than using Greengenes, while assignment results of different 16S rRNA variable sub-regions varied up to 40% between samples analysed with the same pipeline. Conclusions: Our results support the use of either QIIME 2 or MAPseq for optimal 16S rRNA gene profiling, and we suggest that the choice between the two should be based on the level of recall, precision, and/or computational performance required.","Bacteria; Biodiversity; Databases, Genetic; Environmental Microbiology; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Microbiota; Oceans and Seas; Phylogeny; Principal Component Analysis; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil; RNA 16S; bacterium; biodiversity; classification; environmental microbiology; genetic database; genetics; human; intestine flora; microflora; phylogeny; principal component analysis; sea; soil","","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054929668"

Potentilla micrantha is a species that does not develop berries but shares numerous morphological and ecological characteristics with Fragaria vesca. These similarities make P. micrantha an attractive choice for comparative genomics studies with F. vesca. Findings: In this study, the P. micrantha genome was sequenced and annotated, and RNA-Seq data from the different developmental stages of flowering and fruiting were used to develop a set of gene predictions. A 327 Mbp sequence and annotation of the genome of P. micrantha, spanning 2674 sequence contigs, with an N50 size of 335,712, estimated to cover 80% of the total genome size of the species was developed. The genus Potentilla has a characteristically larger genome size than Fragaria, but the recovered sequence scaffolds were remarkably collinear at the micro-syntenic level with the genome of F. vesca, its closest sequenced relative. A total of 33,602 genes were predicted, and 95.1% of bench-marking universal single-copy orthologous genes were complete within the presented sequence. Thus, we argue that the majority of the gene-rich regions of the genome have been sequenced. Conclusions: Comparisons of RNA-Seq data from the stages of floral and fruit development revealed genes differentially expressed between P. micrantha and F. vesca.The data presented are a valuable resource for future studies of berry development in Fragaria and the Rosaceae and they also shed light on the evolution of genome size and organization in this family. © The Author(s) 2018.","Flowers; Fragaria; Fruit; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genome, Plant; Phylogeny; Potentilla; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; Whole Genome Sequencing; plant DNA; transcriptome; transcriptome; Article; developmental stage; DNA isolation; flow cytometry; flower development; flowering; Fragaria; Fragaria vesca; fruit development; fruiting; gene expression; gene sequence; genome size; heterozygosity; nonhuman; plant genome; Potentilla; Potentilla micrantha; prediction; priority journal; RNA extraction; RNA sequence; synteny; comparative study; flower; Fragaria; fruit; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; phylogeny; Potentilla; sequence analysis; whole genome sequencing","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047639049"

The traits of Meishan are strongly associated with its distinct evolutionary history and domestication. However, the genomic evidence linking the domestication of Meishan pigs with its unique features is still poorly understood. The goal of this study is to investigate the genomic signatures and evolutionary evidence related to the phenotypic traits of Meishan via large-scale sequencing. Results: We found that the unique domestication of Meishan pigs occurred in the Taihu Basin area between the Majiabang and Liangzhu Cultures, during which 300 protein-coding genes have underwent positive selection. Notably, enrichment of the FoxO signaling pathway with significant enrichment signal and the harbored gene IGF1R were likely associated with the high fertility of Meishan pigs. Moreover, NFKB1 exhibited strong selective sweep signals and positively participated in hyaluronan biosynthesis as the key gene of NF-kB signaling, which may have resulted in the wrinkled skin and face of Meishan pigs. Particularly, three population-specific synonymous single-nucleotide variants occurred in PYROXD1, MC1R, and FAM83G genes; the T305C substitution in the MCIR gene explained the black coat of the Meishan pigs well. In addition, the shared haplotypes between Meishan and Duroc breeds confirmed the previous Asian-derived introgression and demonstrated the specific contribution of Meishan pigs. Conclusions: These findings will help us explain the unique genetic and phenotypic characteristics of Meishan pigs and offer a plausible method for their utilization of Meishan pigs as valuable genetic resources in pig breeding and as an animal model for human wrinkled skin disease research. © 2018 Oxford University Press.

It is characterized by fast growth, strong stress tolerance, a high reproduction rate, and adaptation to a broad range of environments. Results: Here, we used long-read sequencing to produce a 440-Mb high-quality, chromosome-level assembly of the P. canaliculata genome. In total, 50 Mb (11.4%) repeat sequences and 21,533 gene models were identified in the genome. The major findings of this study include the recent explosion of DNA/hAT-Charlie transposable elements, the expansion of the P450 gene family, and the constitution of the cellular homeostasis system, which contributes to ecological plasticity in stress adaptation. In addition, the high transcriptional levels of perivitelline genes in the ovary and albumen gland promote the function of nutrient supply and defense ability in eggs. Furthermore, the gut metagenome also contains diverse genes for food digestion and xenobiotic degradation.

However, most of the biological questions concerning genomics, phylogenetics, and genetics of some important economic traits have not been answered. It is thus necessary to complete a high-quality genome sequence as well as a series of comparative genomics, evolution, and functional studies. Results: Here, we present a quail genome assembly spanning 1.04 Gb with 86.63% of sequences anchored to 30 chromosomes (28 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes Z/W). Our genomic data have resolved the long-term debate of phylogeny among Perdicinae (Japanese quail), Meleagridinae (Turkey), and Phasianinae (chicken). Comparative genomics and functional genomic data found that four candidate genes involved in early maturation had experienced positive selection, and one of them encodes follicle stimulating hormone beta (FSHβ), which is correlated with different FSHβ levels in quail and chicken. We re-sequenced 31 quails (10 wild, 11 egg-type, and 10 meat-type) and identified 18 and 26 candidate selective sweep regions in the egg-type and meat-type lines, respectively. That only one of them is shared between egg-type and meat-type lines suggests that they were subject to an independent selection. We also detected a haplotype on chromosome Z, which was closely linked with maroon/yellow plumage in quail using population resequencing and a genome-wide association study. This haplotype block will be useful for quail breeding programs. Conclusions: This study provided a high-quality quail reference genome, identified quail-specific genes, and resolved quail phylogeny. We have identified genes related to quail early maturation and a marker for plumage color, which is significant for quail breeding. These results will facilitate biological discovery in quails and help us elucidate the evolutionary processes within the Phasianidae family. © The Author(s) 2018.

Along the way, the golden mussel has outcompeted native species and economically harmed aquaculture, hydroelectric powers, and ship transit. We have sequenced the complete genome of the golden mussel to understand the molecular basis of its invasiveness and search for ways to control it. Findings: We assembled the 1.6-Gb genome into 20 548 scaffolds with an N50 length of 312 Kb using a hybrid and hierarchical assembly strategy from short and long DNA reads and transcriptomes. A total of 60 717 coding genes were inferred from a customized transcriptome-trained AUGUSTUS run. We also compared predicted protein sets with those of complete molluscan genomes, revealing an exacerbation of protein-binding domains in L. fortunei. Conclusions: We built one of the best bivalve genome assemblies available using a cost-effective approach using Illumina paired-end, mate-paired, and PacBio long reads. We expect that the continuous and careful annotation of L. fortunei's genome will contribute to the investigation of bivalve genetics, evolution, and invasiveness, as well as to the development of biotechnological tools for aquatic pest control. © The Author(s) 2017.","Animals; Brazil; Contig Mapping; Gene Ontology; Genome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Introduced Species; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Mytilidae; Open Reading Frames; Pest Control; Phylogeny; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Proteins; Transcriptome; thrombospondin; transcriptome; protein; transcriptome; Article; binding affinity; diploidy; DNA extraction; DNA library; gene duplication; gene structure; genome analysis; genome size; golden mussel; heterozygosity; immune response; innate immunity; Limnoperna fortunei; multigene family; mussel; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; protein binding; protein expression; protein protein interaction; RNA sequence; sequence analysis; animal; Brazil; classification; contig mapping; gene ontology; genetics; genome; high throughput sequencing; introduced species; metabolism; molecular genetics; Mytilidae; open reading frame; pest control; procedures; protein domain","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051719856"

It provides higher phylogenetic resolution than single-end reads due to a longer read length. However, the reverse read (R2) often has significant low base quality, and a large proportion of R2s will be discarded after quality control, resulting in a mixture of paired-end and single-end reads. A typical 16S analysis pipeline usually processes either paired-end or single-end reads but not a mixture. Thus, the quantification accuracy and statistical power will be reduced due to the loss of a large amount of reads. As a result, rare taxa may not be detectable with the paired-end approach, or low taxonomic resolution will result in a single-end approach. Results: To have both the higher phylogenetic resolution provided by paired-end reads and the higher sequence coverage by single-end reads, we propose a novel OTU-picking pipeline, hybrid-denovo, that can process a hybrid of single-end and paired-end reads. Using high-quality paired-end reads as a gold standard, we show that hybrid-denovo achieved the highest correlation with the gold standard and performed better than the approaches based on paired-end or single-end reads in terms of quantifying the microbial diversity and taxonomic abundances. By applying our method to a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) data set, we demonstrated that hybrid-denovo captured more microbial diversity and identified more RA-associated taxa than a paired-end or single-end approach. Conclusions: Hybrid-denovo utilizes both paired-end and single-end 16S sequencing reads and is recommended for 16S rRNA gene targeted paired-end sequencing data. © The Author(s) 2018.","Computational Biology; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Microbiota; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; RNA 16S; RNA 16S; 16S rRNA gene; amplicon; clinical article; controlled study; Enterobacteriaceae; Erwinia; feces analysis; gene sequence; genetic procedures; gold standard; human; Lachnobacterium; limit of quantitation; measurement accuracy; microbial diversity; nonhuman; Note; operational taxonomic unit picking pipeline; phylogeny; priority journal; quality control; rheumatoid arthritis; Ruminococcaceae; taxonomic identification; biology; DNA sequence; genetics; high throughput sequencing; microflora; phylogeny; procedures","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045207122"

However, even when focal, brain lesions have local and remote effects that impact functionally and structurally connected circuits. Similarly, function emerges from the interaction between brain areas rather than their sole activity. For instance, category fluency requires the associations between executive, semantic, and language production functions. Findings: Here, we provide, for the first time, a set of complementary solutions for measuring the impact of a given lesion on the neuronal circuits. Our methods, which were applied to 37 patients with a focal frontal brain lesions, revealed a large set of directly and indirectly disconnected brain regions that had significantly impacted category fluency performance. The directly disconnected regions corresponded to areas that are classically considered as functionally engaged in verbal fluency and categorization tasks. These regions were also organized into larger directly and indirectly disconnected functional networks, including the left ventral fronto-parietal network, whose cortical thickness correlated with performance on category fluency. Conclusions: The combination of structural and functional connectivity together with cortical thickness estimates reveal the remote effects of brain lesions, provide for the identification of the affected networks, and strengthen our understanding of their relationship with cognitive and behavioral measures.

The cell line is derived from an unknown number of larvae from an unspecified strain of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Toward improved utility of the cell line for research in virus transmission, we present an annotated assembly of the C6/36 genome. Results: The C6/36 genome assembly has the largest contig N50 (3.3 Mbp) of any mosquito assembly, presents the sequences of both haplotypes for most of the diploid genome, reveals independent null mutations in both alleles of the Dicer locus, and indicates a male-specific genome. Gene annotation was computed with publicly available mosquito transcript sequences. Gene expression data from cell line RNA sequence identified enrichment of growth-related pathways and conspicuous deficiency in aquaporins and inward rectifier K+ channels. As a test of utility, RNA sequence data from Zika-infected cells were mapped to the C6/36 genome and transcriptome assemblies. Host subtraction reduced the data set by 89%, enabling faster characterization of nonhost reads.

The recent accumulation of functional genomics (""omics""), including metabolomics data, has created new opportunities for studying the functional role of specific changes in the genome. Functional genomic data are characterized by their high dimensionality, the presence of (strong) statistical dependency between traits, and, potentially, complex genetic control. Therefore, the analysis of such data requires specific statistical genetics methods. Results: To facilitate our understanding of the genetic control of omics phenotypes, we propose a trait-centered, network-based conditional genetic association (cGAS) approach for identifying the direct effects of genetic variants on omics-based traits. For each trait of interest, we selected from a biological network a set of other traits to be used as covariates in the cGAS. The network can be reconstructed either from biological pathway databases (a mechanistic approach) or directly from the data, using a Gaussian graphical model applied to the metabolome (a data-driven approach). We derived mathematical expressions that allow comparison of the power of univariate analyses with conditional genetic association analyses. We then tested our approach using data from a population-based Cooperative Health Research in the region of Augsburg (KORA) study (n = 1,784 subjects, 1.7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms) with measured data for 151 metabolites. Conclusions: We found that compared to single-trait analysis, performing a genetic association analysis that includes biologically relevant covariates can either gain or lose power, depending on specific pleiotropic scenarios, for which we provide empirical examples. In the context of analyzed metabolomics data, the mechanistic network approach had more power compared to the data-driven approach. Nevertheless, we believe that our analysis shows that neither a prior-knowledge-only approach nor a phenotypic-data-only approach is optimal, and we discuss possibilities for improvement.  © The Author(s) 2018.","Algorithms; Genetic Loci; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; adult; article; female; genetic association study; genetic regulation; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; medical research; metabolome; metabolomics; phenotype; pleiotropy; single nucleotide polymorphism; univariate analysis; algorithm; gene locus; genetics; genotype; metabolism; metabolome; metabolomics; procedures","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058610423"

High-throughput platforms and the development of improved algorithms for rosette image segmentation make it possible to extract shape and size parameters for genetic, physiological, and environmental studies on a large scale. The development of low-cost phenotyping platforms and freeware resources make it possible to widely expand phenotypic analysis tools for Arabidopsis. However, objective descriptors of shape parameters that could be used independently of the platform and segmentation software used are still lacking, and shape descriptions still rely on ad hoc or even contradictory descriptors, which could make comparisons difficult and perhaps inaccurate. Modern geometric morphometrics is a family of methods in quantitative biology proposed to be the main source of data and analytical tools in the emerging field of phenomics studies. Based on the location of landmarks (corresponding points) over imaged specimens and by combining geometry, multivariate analysis, and powerful statistical techniques, these tools offer the possibility to reproducibly and accurately account for shape variations among groups and measure them in shape distance units. Results: Here, a particular scheme of landmark placement on Arabidopsis rosette images is proposed to study shape variation in viral infection processes. Shape differences between controls and infected plants are quantified throughout the infectious process and visualized. Quantitative comparisons between two unrelated ssRNA+ viruses are shown, and reproducibility issues are assessed. Conclusions: Combined with the newest automated platforms and plant segmentation procedures, geometric morphometric tools could boost phenotypic features extraction and processing in an objective, reproducible manner. © The Author(s) 2018.

Monk fruit has become an important area for research because of the pharmacological and economic potential of its noncaloric, extremely sweet components (mogrosides). It is also commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of lung congestion, sore throat, and constipation. Recently, a single reference genome became available for monk fruit, assembled from 36.9x genome coverage reads via Illumina sequencing platforms. This genome assembly has a relatively short (34.2 kb) contig N50 length and lacks integrated annotations. These drawbacks make it difficult to use as a reference in assembling transcriptomes and discovering novel functional genes. Findings: Here, we offer a new high-quality draft of the S. grosvenorii genome assembled using 31 Gb (~73.8x) long single molecule real time sequencing reads and polished with ~50 Gb Illumina paired-end reads. The final genome assembly is approximately 469.5 Mb, with a contig N50 length of 432,384 bp, representing a 12.6-fold improvement. We further annotated 237.3 Mb of repetitive sequence and 30,565 consensus protein coding genes with combined evidence. Phylogenetic analysis showed that S. grosvenorii diverged from members of the Cucurbitaceae family approximately 40.9 million years ago. With comprehensive transcriptomic analysis and differential expression testing, we identified 4,606 up-regulated genes in the early fruit compared to the leaf, a number of which were linked to metabolic pathways regulating fruit development and ripening. Conclusions: The availability of this new monk fruit genome assembly, as well as the annotations, will facilitate the discovery of new functional genes and the genetic improvement of monk fruit. © The Author(s) 2018.

Here, we tested the feasibility for in situ molecular analyses of endemic fauna using a portable laboratory fitting within a single backpack in one of the world's most imperiled biodiversity hotspots, the Ecuadorian Chocó rainforest. We used portable equipment, including the MinION nanopore sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and the miniPCR (miniPCR), to perform DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction amplification, and real-time DNA barcoding of reptile specimens in the field. Findings: We demonstrate that nanopore sequencing can be implemented in a remote tropical forest to quickly and accurately identify species using DNA barcoding, as we generated consensus sequences for species resolution with an accuracy of > 99% in less than 24 hours after collecting specimens. The flexibility of our mobile laboratory further allowed us to generate sequence information at the Universidad Tecnológica Indoamérica in Quito for rare, endangered, and undescribed species. This includes the recently rediscovered Jambato toad, which was thought to be extinct for 28 years. Sequences generated on the MinION required as few as 30 reads to achieve high accuracy relative to Sanger sequencing, and with further multiplexing of samples, nanopore sequencing can become a cost-effective approach for rapid and portable DNA barcoding. Conclusions: Overall, we establish how mobile laboratories and nanopore sequencing can help to accelerate species identification in remote areas to aid in conservation efforts and be applied to research facilities in developing countries. This opens up possibilities for biodiversity studies by promoting local research capacity building, teaching nonspecialists and students about the environment, tackling wildlife crime, and promoting conservation via research-focused ecotourism. © The Author(s) 2018.","Animals; Biodiversity; Ecuador; Nanopores; Rainforest; Reptiles; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Article; biodiversity; consensus sequence; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; developing country; DNA barcoding; DNA extraction; endangered species; fauna; feasibility study; laboratory test; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; reptile; species endemicity; tropical rain forest; animal; DNA sequence; Ecuador; genetics; nanopore; procedures; rain forest","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053045602"

However, despite its scientific importance, no transcriptome data have been generated for deciphering the early developmental stages of the chicken because of practical and technical constraints in accessing pre-oviposited embryos. Findings: Here, we determine the entire transcriptome of pre-oviposited avian embryos, including oocyte, zygote, and intrauterine embryos from Eyal-giladi and Kochav stage I (EGK.I) to EGK.X collected using a noninvasive approach for the first time. We also compare RNA-sequencing data obtained using a bulked embryo sequencing and single embryo/cell sequencing technique. The raw sequencing data were preprocessed with two genome builds, Galgal4 and Galgal5, and the expression of 17,108 and 26,102 genes was quantified in the respective builds. There were some differences between the two techniques, as well as between the two genome builds, and these were affected by the emergence of long intergenic noncoding RNA annotations. Conclusion: The first transcriptome datasets of pre-oviposited early chicken embryos based on bulked and single embryo sequencing techniques will serve as a valuable resource for investigating early avian embryogenesis, for comparative studies among vertebrates, and for novel gene annotation in the chicken genome.","Animals; Blastoderm; Chick Embryo; Chickens; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Oocytes; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; Zygote; transcriptome; animal; blastoderm; chick embryo; chicken; gene expression regulation; genetics; oocyte; sequence analysis; zygote","","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058408609"

The conclusions of this study have been published elsewhere, but in this data note we extend the analysis, providing morphological comparisons including details such as curvature comparisons, thickness, etc. Physical compression results of individual fangs, though reported in the original paper, were also extended here by calculating the effective elastic modulus of the entire snake fang structure including internal cavities for the first time. This elastic modulus of the entire fang is significantly lower than the locally measured values previously reported from indentation experiments, highlighting the possibility that the elastic modulus is higher on the surface than in the rest of the material. The micro-computed tomography (microCT) data are presented both in image stacks and in the form of STL files, which simplifies the handling of the data and allows its re-use for future morphological studies.

While large genome centers or genome groups have developed software tools for post-annotation assembly filtering, annotation, and conversion into the NCBI's annotation table format, these tools typically require back-end setup and connection to an Structured Query Language (SQL) database and/or some knowledge of programming (Perl, Python) to implement. With WGS becoming commonplace, genome sequencing projects are moving away from the genome centers and into the ecology or biology lab, where fewer resources are present to support the process of genome assembly curation. To fill this gap, we developed software to assess, filter, and transfer annotation and convert a draft genome assembly and annotation set into the NCBI annotation table (.tbl) format, facilitating submission to the NCBI Genome Assembly database. This software has no dependencies, is compatible across platforms, and utilizes a simple command to perform a variety of simple and complex post-analysis, pre-NCBI submission WGS project tasks. Findings: The Genome Annotation Generator is a consistent and user-friendly bioinformatics tool that can be used to generate a .tbl file that is consistent with the NCBI submission pipeline. Conclusions: The Genome Annotation Generator achieves the goal of providing a publicly available tool that will facilitate the submission of annotated genome assemblies to the NCBI. It is useful for any individual researcher or research group that wishes to submit a genome assembly of their study system to the NCBI.","Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Software; Whole Genome Sequencing; biology; genetic database; molecular genetics; procedures; software; whole genome sequencing","","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051443829"

However, treatment failure is common and linked to in vivo drug resistance. In Giardia, in vitro drug-resistant lines allow controlled experimental interrogation of resistance mechanisms in isogenic cultures. However, resistance-associated changes are inconsistent between lines, phenotypic data are incomplete, and resistance is rarely genetically fixed, highlighted by reversion to sensitivity after drug selection ceases or via passage through the life cycle. Comprehensive quantitative approaches are required to resolve isolate variability, fully define Mtz resistance phenotypes, and explore the role of post-translational modifications therein. Findings: We performed quantitative proteomics to describe differentially expressed proteins in 3 seminal Mtz-resistant lines compared to their isogenic, Mtz-susceptible, parental line. We also probed changes in post-translational modifications including protein acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation via immunoblotting. We quantified more than 1,000 proteins in each genotype, recording substantial genotypic variation in differentially expressed proteins between isotypes. Our data confirm substantial changes in the antioxidant network, glycolysis, and electron transport and indicate links between protein acetylation and Mtz resistance, including cross-resistance to deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A in Mtz-resistant lines. Finally, we performed the first controlled, longitudinal study of Mtz resistance stability, monitoring lines after cessation of drug selection, revealing isolate-dependent phenotypic plasticity. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate understanding that Mtz resistance must be broadened to post-transcriptional and post-translational responses and that Mtz resistance is polygenic, driven by isolate-dependent variation, and is correlated with changes in protein acetylation networks.","Antiprotozoal Agents; Drug Resistance; Giardia lamblia; Metronidazole; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Protozoan Proteins; antiprotozoal agent; metronidazole; protozoal protein; drug effect; drug resistance; Giardia intestinalis; metabolism; protein processing","","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055082019"

Mattos is a keystone Neotropical hardwood tree widely distributed in seasonally dry tropical forests of South and Mesoamerica. Regarded as the ""new mahogany,"" it is the second most expensive timber, the most logged species in Brazil, and currently under significant illegal trading pressure. The plant produces large amounts of quinoids, specialized metabolites with documented antitumorous and antibiotic effects. The development of genomic resources is needed to better understand and conserve the diversity of the species, to empower forensic identification of the origin of timber, and to identify genes for important metabolic compounds. Findings: The genome assembly covers 503.7 Mb (N50 = 81 316 bp), 90.4% of the 557-Mbp genome, with 13 206 scaffolds. A repeat database with 1508 sequences was developed, allowing masking of ~31% of the assembly. Depth of coverage indicated that consensus determination adequately removed haplotypes assembled separately due to the extensive heterozygosity of the species. Automatic gene prediction provided 31 688 structures and 35 479 messenger RNA transcripts, while external evidence supported a well-curated set of 28 603 high-confidence models (90% of total). Finally, we used the genomic sequence and the comprehensive gene content annotation to identify genes related to the production of specialized metabolites. Conclusions: This genome assembly is the first well-curated resource for a Neotropical forest tree and the first one for a member of the Bignoniaceae family, opening exceptional opportunities to empower molecular, phytochemical, and breeding studies.

A major challenge is that the perceived qualities vary greatly among individuals due to different genetic and cultural backgrounds. Moreover, the combinatorial interactions between multiple odorant receptors and diverse molecules significantly complicate the olfaction prediction. Many attempts have been made to establish structure-odor relationships for intensity and pleasantness, but no models are available to predict the personalized multi-odor attributes of molecules. In this study, we describe our winning algorithm for predicting individual and population perceptual responses to various odorants in the DREAM Olfaction Prediction Challenge. Results: We find that random forest model consisting of multiple decision trees is well suited to this prediction problem, given the large feature spaces and high variability of perceptual ratings among individuals. Integrating both population and individual perceptions into our model effectively reduces the influence of noise and outliers. By analyzing the importance of each chemical feature, we find that a small set of low- and nondegenerative features is sufficient for accurate prediction.

The high throughput is made possible by the early introduction of sample-specific bar codes (BCs), and the amplification bias is alleviated by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Thus, the ideal analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq data needs to efficiently tabulate reads according to both BC and UMI. Findings: zUMIs is a pipeline that can handle both known and random BCs and also efficiently collapse UMIs, either just for exon mapping reads or for both exon and intron mapping reads. If BC annotation is missing, zUMIs can accurately detect intact cells from the distribution of sequencing reads. Another unique feature of zUMIs is the adaptive downsampling function that facilitates dealing with hugely varying library sizes but also allows the user to evaluate whether the library has been sequenced to saturation. To illustrate the utility of zUMIs, we analyzed a single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset and show that more than 35% of all reads map to introns. Also, we show that these intronic reads are informative about expression levels, significantly increasing the number of detected genes and improving the cluster resolution. Conclusions: zUMIs flexibility makes if possible to accommodate data generated with any of the major scRNA-seq protocols that use BCs and UMIs and is the most feature-rich, fast, and user-friendly pipeline to process such scRNA-seq data. © The Author(s) 2018.

However, beyond broad proteomic and transcriptomic surveys of molluscan shells and the shell-forming mantle tissue, little is known of the spatial and ontogenetic regulation of shell fabrication. In addition, most efforts have been focused on species that deposit nacre, which is at odds with the majority of conchiferan species that fabricate shells using a crossed-lamellar microstructure, sensu lato. Results: By combining proteomic and transcriptomic sequencing with in situ hybridization we have identified a suite of gene products associated with the production of the crossed-lamellar shell in Lymnaea stagnalis. With this spatial expression data we are able to generate novel hypotheses of how the adult mantle tissue coordinates the deposition of the calcified shell. These hypotheses include functional roles for unusual and otherwise difficult-to-study proteins such as those containing repetitive low-complexity domains. The spatial expression readouts of shell-forming genes also reveal cryptic patterns of asymmetry and modularity in the shell-forming cells of larvae and adult mantle tissue. Conclusions: This molecular modularity of the shell-forming mantle tissue hints at intimate associations between structure, function, and evolvability and may provide an elegant explanation for the evolutionary success of the second largest phylum among the Metazoa. © The Author(s) 2018.

Alarmingly, resistance to polymyxins has been increasingly reported worldwide recently. To rescue this last-resort class of antibiotics, it is necessary to systematically understand how P. aeruginosa alters its metabolism in response to polymyxin treatment, thereby facilitating the development of effective therapies. To this end, a genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) was used to analyze bacterial metabolic changes at the systems level. Findings: A high-quality GSMM iPAO1 was constructed for P. aeruginosa PAO1 for antimicrobial pharmacological research. Model iPAO1 encompasses an additional periplasmic compartment and contains 3022 metabolites, 4265 reactions, and 1458 genes in total. Growth prediction on 190 carbon and 95 nitrogen sources achieved an accuracy of 89.1%, outperforming all reported P. aeruginosa models. Notably, prediction of the essential genes for growth achieved a high accuracy of 87.9%. Metabolic simulation showed that lipid A modifications associated with polymyxin resistance exert a limited impact on bacterial growth and metabolism but remarkably change the physiochemical properties of the outer membrane. Modeling with transcriptomics constraints revealed a broad range of metabolic responses to polymyxin treatment, including reduced biomass synthesis, upregulated amino acid catabolism, induced flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and increased redox turnover. Conclusions: Overall, iPAO1 represents the most comprehensive GSMM constructed to date for Pseudomonas. It provides a powerful systems pharmacology platform for the elucidation of complex killing mechanisms of antibiotics.","Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Genome, Bacterial; Models, Biological; Polymyxins; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; antiinfective agent; polymyxin; antibiotic resistance; bacterial genome; biological model; drug effect; genetics; metabolism; Pseudomonas aeruginosa","","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056806389"

Increasing the yield and stress tolerance of these crops is essential to meet the growing need for food. The cost and speed of plant phenotyping are currently the largest constraints on plant breeding efforts. Datasets linking new types of high-throughput phenotyping data collected from plants to the performance of the same genotypes under agronomic conditions across a wide range of environments are essential for developing new statistical approaches and computer vision-based tools. Findings A set of maize inbreds-primarily recently offpatent lines-were phenotyped using a high-throughput platform at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. These lines have been previously subjected to high-density genotyping and scored for a core set of 13 phenotypes in field trials across 13 North American states in 2 years by the Genomes 2 Fields Consortium. A total of 485 GB of image data including RGB, hyperspectral, fluorescence, and thermal infrared photos has been released. Conclusions Correlations between image-based measurements and manual measurements demonstrated the feasibility of quantifying variation in plant architecture using image data. However, naive approaches to measuring traits such as biomass can introduce nonrandom measurement errors confounded with genotype variation. Analysis of hyperspectral image data demonstrated unique signatures from stem tissue. Integrating heritable phenotypes from high-throughput phenotyping data with field data from different environments can reveal previously unknown factors that influence yield plasticity. © The Author(s) 2017.","Genotype; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Inbreeding; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Zea mays; biomass; feasibility study; fluorescence imaging; heritability; hyperspectral imaging; image analysis; image processing; imaging; maize; measurement; nonhuman; Note; phenotype; plant genome; priority journal; anatomy and histology; classification; genetics; genotype; inbreeding; maize; plant breeding; procedures; quantitative trait; statistics and numerical data; three dimensional imaging","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045988394"

To guide the analyses, several customizable workflows are included and are supported by tutorials and Galaxy interactive tours, which guide users through the analyses step by step. ASaiM is implemented as a Galaxy Docker flavour. It is scalable to thousands of datasets but also can be used on a normal PC. The associated source code is available under Apache 2 license at https://github.com/ASaiM/framework and documentation can be found online (http://asaim.readthedocs.io). Conclusions: Based on the Galaxy framework, ASaiM offers a sophisticated environment with a variety of tools, workflows, documentation, and training to scientists working on complex microorganism communities.

They form an isolated branch in the tree of placental mammals that are highly divergent from other eulipothyplan insectivores The history, unique biology, and adaptations of these enigmatic venomous species could be illuminated by the availability of genome data. However, a whole genome assembly for solenodons has not been previously performed, partially due to the difficulty in obtaining samples from the field. Island isolation and reduced numbers have likely resulted in high homozygosity within the Hispaniolan solenodon (Solenodon paradoxus). Thus, we tested the performance of several assembly strategies on the genome of this genetically impoverished species. The string graph-based assembly strategy seemed a better choice compared to the conventional de Bruijn graph approach due to the high levels of homozygosity, which is often a hallmark of endemic or endangered species. A consensus reference genome was assembled from sequences of 5 individuals from the southern subspecies (S. p. woodi). In addition, we obtained an additional sequence from 1 sample of the northern subspecies (S. p. paradoxus). The resulting genome assemblies were compared to each other and annotated for genes, with an emphasis on venom genes, repeats, variable microsatellite loci, and other genomic variants. Phylogenetic positioning and selection signatures were inferred based on 4,416 single-copy orthologs from 10 other mammals. We estimated that solenodons diverged from other extant mammals 73.6 million years ago. Patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphism variation allowed us to infer population demography, which supported a subspecies split within the Hispaniolan solenodon at least 300 thousand years ago. © The Author(s) 2018.

Ever more studies imply the microbiome in both normal human physiology and a wide range of diseases. RNA sequencing technology (RNA-seq) is commonly used to infer global eukaryotic gene expression patterns under defined conditions, including human disease-related contexts; however, its generic nature also enables the detection of microbial and viral transcripts. Findings:We developed a bioinformatic pipeline to screen existing human RNA-seq datasets for the presence of microbial and viral reads by re-inspecting the non-human-mapping read fraction. We validated this approach by recapitulating outcomes from six independent, controlled infection experiments of cell line models and compared them with an alternative metatranscriptomic mapping strategy. We then applied the pipeline to close to 150 terabytes of publicly available raw RNA-seq data from more than 17,000 samples from more than 400 studies relevant to human disease using state-of-the-art high-performance computing systems. The resulting data from this large-scale re-analysis are made available in the presented MetaMap resource. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that common human RNA-seq data, including those archived in public repositories, might contain valuable information to correlate microbial and viral detection patterns with diverse diseases. The presented MetaMap database thus provides a rich resource for hypothesis generation toward the role of the microbiome in human disease. Additionally, codes to process new datasets and perform statistical analyses are made available. © The Author(s) 2018.

The study of homologous genes helps us to understand the evolution of gene families. It plays a vital role in finding ancestral gene duplication events as well as identifying genes that have diverged from a common ancestor under positive selection. There are various tools available, such as MSOAR, OrthoMCL, and HomoloGene, to identify gene families and visualize syntenic information between species, providing an overview of syntenic regions evolution at the family level. Unfortunately, none of them provide information about structural changes within genes, such as the conservation of ancestral exon boundaries among multiple genomes. The Ensembl GeneTrees computational pipeline generates gene trees based on coding sequences, provides details about exon conservation, and is used in the Ensembl Compara project to discover gene families. Findings: A certain amount of expertise is required to configure and run the Ensembl Compara GeneTrees pipeline via command line. Therefore, we converted this pipeline into a Galaxy workflow, called GeneSeqToFamily, and provided additional functionality. This workflow uses existing tools from the Galaxy ToolShed, as well as providing additional wrappers and tools that are required to run the workflow. Conclusions: GeneSeqToFamily represents the Ensembl GeneTrees pipeline as a set of interconnected Galaxy tools, so they can be run interactively within the Galaxy's user-friendly workflow environment while still providing the flexibility to tailor the analysis by changing configurations and tools if necessary. Additional tools allow users to subsequently visualize the gene families produced by the workflow, using the Aequatus.js interactive tool, which has been developed as part of the Aequatus software project. © The Author(s) 2018.","Algorithms; Computational Biology; Genome; Phylogeny; Software; User-Computer Interface; Workflow; evolutionary adaptation; gene duplication; genome; genomics; multigene family; muscle contractility; note; orthology; paralogy; phylogeny; pipeline; software; workflow; algorithm; biology; computer interface; genetics; software; workflow","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050754938"

It involves sorting and merging genomic data from different subjects by their genomic locations. In particular, merging a large number of variant call format (VCF) files is frequently required in large-scale whole-genome sequencing or whole-exome sequencing projects. Traditional single-machine based methods become increasingly inefficient when processing large numbers of files due to the excessive computation time and Input/Output bottleneck. Distributed systems and more recent cloud-based systems offer an attractive solution. However, carefully designed and optimized workflow patterns and execution plans (schemas) are required to take full advantage of the increased computing power while overcoming bottlenecks to achieve high performance. Findings: In this study, we custom-design optimized schemas for three Apache big data platforms, Hadoop (MapReduce), HBase, and Spark, to perform sorted merging of a large number of VCF files. These schemas all adopt the divide-and-conquer strategy to split the merging job into sequential phases/stages consisting of subtasks that are conquered in an ordered, parallel, and bottleneck-free way. In two illustrating examples, we test the performance of our schemas on merging multiple VCF files into either a single TPED or a single VCF file, which are benchmarked with the traditional single/parallel multiway-merge methods, message passing interface (MPI)-based high-performance computing (HPC) implementation, and the popular VCFTools. Conclusions: Our experiments suggest all three schemas either deliver a significant improvement in efficiency or render much better strong and weak scalabilities over traditional methods. Our findings provide generalized scalable schemas for performing sorted merging on genetics and genomics data using these Apache distributed systems. © The Author(s) 2018.

Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) has been used for super-resolution single molecule localization microscopy, but less frequently than other fluorescent probes. Working with YFP in SMLM is a challenge because a lower number of photons are emitted per molecule compared with organic dyes, which are more commonly used. Publically available experimental data can facilitate development of new data analysis algorithms. Findings: Four complete, freely available single molecule super-resolution microscopy datasets on YFP-tagged growth factor receptors expressed in a human cell line are presented, including both raw and analyzed data. We report methods for sample preparation, for data acquisition, and for data analysis, as well as examples of the acquired images. We also analyzed the SMLM datasets using a different method: super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI). The 2 modes of analysis offer complementary information about the sample. A fifth single molecule super-resolution microscopy dataset acquired with the dye Alexa 532 is included for comparison purposes. Conclusions: This dataset has potential for extensive reuse. Complete raw data from SMLM experiments have typically not been published. The YFP data exhibit low signal-to-noise ratios, making data analysis a challenge. These datasets will be useful to investigators developing their own algorithms for SMLM, SOFI, and related methods. The data will also be useful for researchers investigating growth factor receptors such as ErbB3. © The Author(s) 2018.","Algorithms; Bacterial Proteins; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Luminescent Proteins; Receptors, Growth Factor; Single Molecule Imaging; growth factor receptor; yellow fluorescent protein; bacterial protein; fluorescent dye; growth factor receptor; photoprotein; yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria; A-431 cell line; comparative study; controlled study; fluorescence imaging; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; image analysis; microscopy; Note; priority journal; signal noise ratio; super resolution optical fluctuation imaging; super resolution single molecule localization microscopy; algorithm; chemistry; isolation and purification; procedures; single molecule imaging","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048201300"

Results: Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), we profiled the DNA methylome of cattle sperm through comparison with three somatic tissues (mammary gland, brain, and blood). Large differences between cattle sperm and somatic cells were observed in the methylation patterns of global CpGs, pericentromeric satellites, partially methylated domains (PMDs), hypomethylated regions (HMRs), and common repeats. As expected, we observed low methylation in the promoter regions and high methylation in the bodies of active genes. We detected selective hypomethylation of megabase domains of centromeric satellite clusters, which may be related to chromosome segregation during meiosis and their rapid transcriptional activation upon fertilization. We found more PMDs in sperm cells than in somatic cells and identified meiosis-related genes such as KIF2B and REPIN1, which are hypomethylated in sperm but hypermethylated in somatic cells. In addition to the common HMRs around gene promoters, which showed substantial differences between sperm and somatic cells, the sperm-specific HMRs also targeted to distinct spermatogenesis-related genes, including BOLL, MAEL, ASZ1, SYCP3, CTCFL, MND1, SPATA22, PLD6, DDX4, RBBP8, FKBP6, and SYCE1. Although common repeats were heavily methylated in both sperm and somatic cells, some young Bov-A2 repeats, which belong to the SINE family, were hypomethylated in sperm and could affect the promoter structures by introducing new regulatory elements.

Images are uploaded to our cloud framework where users assess the quality of each image using a client-side web application. Reports can then be generated as a tab-delimited file or annotated Variant Call Format (VCF) file. As a proof of principle, nine researchers collaborated for 1 hour to evaluate 1,350 SVs each. We anticipate that SV-plaudit will become a standard step in variant calling pipelines and the crowd-sourced curation of other biological results.

Furthermore, the black porgy is a good model for investigating sex changes in fish due to its protandrous hermaphroditism. Here, we obtained a high-quality genome assembly of this interesting teleost species and performed a genomic survey on potential genes associated with the sex-change phenomenon. Findings: We generated 175.4 gigabases (Gb) of clean sequence reads using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy. The final genome assembly is approximately 688.1 megabases (Mb), accounting for 93% of the estimated genome size (739.6 Mb). The achieved scaffold N50 is 7.6 Mb, reaching a relatively high level among sequenced fish species. We identified 19 465 protein-coding genes, which had an average transcript length of 17.3 kb. By performing a comparative genomic analysis, we found 3 types of genes potentially associated with sex change, which are useful for studying the genetic basis of the protandrous hermaphroditism. Conclusions: We provide a draft genome assembly of the Chinese black porgy and discuss the potential genetic mechanisms of sex change. These data are also an important resource for studying the biology and for facilitating breeding of this economically important fish. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

The most common way to assess regional lymph node status is the sentinel lymph node procedure. The sentinel lymph node is the most likely lymph node to contain metastasized cancer cells and is excised, histopathologically processed, and examined by a pathologist. This tedious examination process is time-consuming and can lead to small metastases being missed. However, recent advances in whole-slide imaging and machine learning have opened an avenue for analysis of digitized lymph node sections with computer algorithms. For example, convolutional neural networks, a type of machine-learning algorithm, can be used to automatically detect cancer metastases in lymph nodes with high accuracy. To train machine-learning models, large, well-curated datasets are needed. Results: We released a dataset of 1,399 annotated whole-slide images (WSIs) of lymph nodes, both with and without metastases, in 3 terabytes of data in the context of the CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 Grand Challenges. Slides were collected from five medical centers to cover a broad range of image appearance and staining variations. Each WSI has a slide-level label indicating whether it contains no metastases, macro-metastases, micro-metastases, or isolated tumor cells. Furthermore, for 209 WSIs, detailed hand-drawn contours for all metastases are provided. Last, open-source software tools to visualize and interact with the data have been made available. Conclusions: A unique dataset of annotated, whole-slide digital histopathology images has been provided with high potential for re-use. © The Author(s) 2018.

Treatment options are limited, ineffective, and, for most patients, result in death in less than a year. We previously developed a first-in-field patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of NEtD. Longitudinal deep transcriptome profiling of this model enabled monitoring of dynamic transcriptional changes during NEtD and in the context of androgen deprivation. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) are implicated in cancer where they can control gene regulation. Until now, the expression of lncRNAs during NEtD and their clinical associations were unexplored. Results: We implemented a next-generation sequence analysis pipeline that can detect transcripts at low expression levels and built a genome-wide catalogue (n = 37,749) of lncRNAs. We applied this pipeline to 927 clinical samples and our high-fidelity NEtD model LTL331 and identified 821 lncRNAs in NEPC. Among these are 122 lncRNAs that robustly distinguish NEPC from prostate adenocarcinoma (AD) patient tumours. The highest expressed lncRNAs within this signature are H19, LINC00617, and SSTR5-AS1. Another 742 are associated with the NEtD process and fall into four distinct patterns of expression (NEtD lncRNA Class I, II, III, and IV) in our PDX model and clinical samples. Each class has significant (z-scores > 2) and unique enrichment for transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs in their sequences. Enriched TFBS include (1) TP53 and BRN1 in Class I, (2) ELF5, SPIC, and HOXD1 in Class II, (3) SPDEF in Class III, (4) HSF1 and FOXA1 in Class IV, and (5) TWIST1 when merging Class III with IV. Common TFBS in all NEtD lncRNA were also identified and include E2F, REST, PAX5, PAX9, and STAF. Interrogation of the top deregulated candidates (n = 100) in radical prostatectomy adenocarcinoma samples with long-term follow-up (median 18 years) revealed significant clinicopathological associations. Specifically, we identified 25 that are associated with rapid metastasis following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Two of these lncRNAs (SSTR5-AS1 and LINC00514) stratified patients undergoing ADT based on patient outcome. Discussion: To date, a comprehensive characterization of the dynamic landscape of lncRNAs during the NEtD process has not been performed. A temporal analysis of the PDX-based NEtD model has for the first time provided this dynamic landscape. TFBS analysis identified NEPC-related TF motifs present within the NEtD lncRNA sequences, suggesting functional roles for these lncRNAs in NEPC pathogenesis. Furthermore, select NEtD lncRNAs appear to be associated with metastasis and patients receiving ADT. Treatment-related metastasis is a clinical consequence of NEPC tumours. Top candidate lncRNAs FENDRR, H19, LINC00514, LINC00617, and SSTR5-AS1 identified in this study are implicated in the development of NEPC. We present here for the first time a genome-wide catalogue of NEtD lncRNAs that characterize the transdifferentiation process and a robust NEPC lncRNA patient expression signature. To accomplish this, we carried out the largest integrative study that applied a PDX NEtD model to clinical samples. These NEtD and NEPC lncRNAs are strong candidates for clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets and warrant further investigation. © The Author(s) 2018.

However, no genomic information for the Monopterus is currently available. Findings: Here, we sequenced and de novo assembled the genome of M. albus and report the de novo chromosome assembly by FISH walking assisted by conserved synteny (Cafs). Using Cafs, 328 scaffolds were assembled into 12 chromosomes, which covered genomic sequences of 555 Mb, accounting for 81.3% of the sequences assembled in scaffolds (∼689 Mb). A total of 18,660 genes were mapped on the chromosomes and showed a nonrandom distribution along chromosomes. Conclusions: We report the first reference genome of the Monopterus and provide an efficient Cafs strategy for a de novo chromosome-level assembly of the Monopterus genome, which provides a valuable resource, not only for further studies in genetics, evolution, and development, particularly sex determination, but also for breed improvement of the species. © The Author(s) 2018.

Here we report the first catalog of microbial genes in fecal samples from Sprague-Dawley rats. Findings: The catalog was established using 98 fecal samples from 49 SD rats, divided in 7 experimental groups, and collected at different time points 30 days apart. The established gene catalog comprises 5,130,167 non-redundant genes with an average length of 750 bp, among which 64.6% and 26.7% were annotated to phylum and genus levels, respectively. Functionally, 53.1%, 21.8%,and 31% of the genes could be annotated to KEGG orthologous groups, modules, and pathways, respectively. Conclusions: A comparison of rat gut metagenome catalogue with human or mouse revealed a higher pairwise overlap between rats and humans (2.47%) than between mice and humans (1.19%) at the gene level.

Findings: Micro computed tomography (μCT) scan data of 5 hermit crab species from South Africa, including rare specimens and type material, depicted main identification characteristics of calcified body parts. However, low-image contrasts, especially in larger (>50 mm total length) specimens, did not allow sufficient 3D reconstructions of weakly calcified and fine characteristics, such as soft tissue of the pleon, mouthparts, gills, and setation. Reconstructions of soft tissue were sometimes possible, depending on individual sample and scanning characteristics. The raw data of seven scans are publicly available for download from the GigaDB repository. Conclusions: Calcified body parts visualized from μCT data can aid taxonomic validation and provide additional, virtual deposition of rare specimens. The use of a nondestructive, nonstaining μCT approach for taxonomy, reconstructions of soft tissue structures, microscopic spines, and setae depend on species characteristics. Constrained to these limitations, the presented dataset can be used for future morphological studies. However, our virtual specimens will be most valuable to taxonomists who can download a digital avatar for 3D examination. Simultaneously, in the event of physical damage to or loss of the original physical specimen, this dataset serves as a vital insurance policy.","Animals; Anomura; Female; Male; South Africa; X-Ray Microtomography; animal; Anomura; female; male; micro-computed tomography; South Africa","","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059693509"

They are popular aquarium species due to their bright colours, adaptability to captivity, and fascinating behavior. Their breeding biology (sequential hermaphrodites) and symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones have attracted much scientific interest. Moreover, there are some curious geographic-based phenotypes that warrant investigation. Leveraging on the advancement in Nanopore long read technology, we report the first hybrid assembly of the clown anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris) genome utilizing Illumina and Nanopore reads, further demonstrating the substantial impact of modest long read sequencing data sets on improving genome assembly statistics. Results: We generated 43 Gb of short Illumina reads and 9 Gb of long Nanopore reads, representing approximate genome coverage of 54× and 11×, respectively, based on the range of estimated k-mer-predicted genome sizes of between 791 and 967 Mbp. The final assembled genome is contained in 6404 scaffolds with an accumulated length of 880 Mb (96.3% BUSCO-calculated genome completeness). Compared with the Illumina-only assembly, the hybrid approach generated 94% fewer scaffolds with an 18-fold increase in N50 length (401 kb) and increased the genome completeness by an additional 16%. A total of 27 240 high-quality protein-coding genes were predicted from the clown anemonefish, 26 211 (96%) of which were annotated functionally with information from either sequence homology or protein signature searches. Conclusions: We present the first genome of any anemonefish and demonstrate the value of low coverage (~11×) long Nanopore read sequencing in improving both genome assembly contiguity and completeness. The near-complete assembly of the A. ocellaris genome will be an invaluable molecular resource for supporting a range of genetic, genomic, and phylogenetic studies specifically for clownfish and more generally for other related fish species of the family Pomacentridae. © The Author(s) 2018.","Animals; Genome; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Nanopores; Perciformes; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; genomic DNA; RNA; transcriptome; Amphiprion ocellaris; animal experiment; animal tissue; female; fin (organ); fish; gene identification; genetic regulation; genome assembly; genome size; male; muscle tissue; nonhuman; Note; phylogeny; prediction; priority journal; sex differentiation; whole genome sequencing; animal; DNA sequence; genetics; genome; genomics; high throughput sequencing; molecular genetics; nanopore; Perciformes; phylogeny; procedures","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050506194"

To quantitatively integrate these studies, we conducted a coordinate-based (CB) meta-analysis using the signed differential mapping method on 15 studies that used amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and 11 studies that used regional homogeneity (ReHo). All ALFF and ReHo studies compared PD patients with healthy controls. We also performed a validation RS-fMRI study of ALFF and ReHo in a frequency-dependent manner for a novel dataset consisting of 49 PD and 49 healthy controls. Findings: Decreased ALFF was found in the left putamen in PD by meta-analysis. This finding was replicated in our independent validation dataset in the 0.027-0.073 Hz band but not in the conventional frequency band of 0.01-0.08 Hz. Conclusions: Findings from the current study suggested that decreased ALFF in the putamen of PD patients is the most consistent finding. RS-fMRI is a promising technique for the precise localization of abnormal spontaneous activity in PD. However, more frequency-dependent studies using the same analytical methods are needed to replicate these results. Trial registration: NCT NCT03439163.

Rapid and scalable pipelines are available for managing and interpreting pan-genomes from large batches of annotated assemblies. However, despite overwhelming evidence that variation in intergenic regions in bacteria can directly influence phenotypes, most current approaches for analyzing pan-genomes focus exclusively on protein-coding sequences. Findings: To address this we present Piggy, a novel pipeline that emulates Roary except that it is based only on intergenic regions. A key utility provided by Piggy is the detection of highly divergent (""switched"") intergenic regions (IGRs) upstream of genes. We demonstrate the use of Piggy on large datasets of clinically important lineages of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Conclusions: For S. aureus, we show that highly divergent (switched) IGRs are associated with differences in gene expression and we establish a multilocus reference database of IGR alleles (igMLST; implemented in BIGSdb). © The Author(s) 2018.","DNA, Intergenic; Escherichia coli; Genome, Bacterial; Genomics; Staphylococcus aureus; spacer DNA; bacterial genome; Escherichia coli; genetics; genomics; procedures; Staphylococcus aureus","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051575732"

The 15-Gb hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) genome has been particularly challenging to sequence, and several different approaches have recently generated long-range assemblies. Mapping and understanding the types of assembly errors are important for optimising future sequencing and assembly approaches and for comparative genomics. Results: Here we use a Fosill 38-kb jumping library to assess medium and longer-range order of different publicly available wheat genome assemblies. Modifications to the Fosill protocol generated longer Illumina sequences and enabled comprehensive genome coverage. Analyses of two independent Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC)-based chromosome-scale assemblies, two independent Illumina whole genome shotgun assemblies, and a hybrid Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT-PacBio) and short read (Illumina) assembly were carried out. We revealed a surprising scale and variety of discrepancies using Fosill mate-pair mapping and validated several of each class. In addition, Fosill mate-pairs were used to scaffold a whole genome Illumina assembly, leading to a 3-fold increase in N50 values. Conclusions: Our analyses, using an independent means to validate different wheat genome assemblies, show that whole genome shotgun assemblies based solely on Illumina sequences are significantly more accurate by all measures compared to BAC-based chromosome-scale assemblies and hybrid SMRT-Illumina approaches. Although current whole genome assemblies are reasonably accurate and useful, additional improvements will be needed to generate complete assemblies of wheat genomes using open-source, computationally efficient, and cost-effective methods.","Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial; Chromosomes, Plant; Contig Mapping; Gene Library; Genome, Plant; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Triticum; bacterial artificial chromosome; contig mapping; DNA sequence; gene library; genetics; plant chromosome; plant genome; procedures; wheat","","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055700168"

Results: A new computational pipeline was set up to process more than 12 trillion bp of sequencing data, and a set of population genetics filters was applied to identify more than 83 million variant sites. Conclusions: We identified polymorphisms in regions where collinearity is largely preserved in the maize species.

As the tools available for these tasks improve, it is useful to return to data produced with earlier techniques to assess their credibility and correctness. The entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora is widely used to control insect pests in horticulture. The genome sequence for this species was reported to encode an unusually high proportion of unique proteins and a paucity of secreted proteins compared to other related nematodes. Findings: We revisited the H. bacteriophora genome assembly and gene predictions to determine whether these unusual characteristics were biological or methodological in origin. We mapped an independent resequencing dataset to the genome and used the blobtools pipeline to identify potential contaminants. While present (0.2% of the genome span, 0.4% of predicted proteins), assembly contamination was not significant. Conclusions: Re-prediction of the gene set using BRAKER1 and published transcriptome data generated a predicted proteome that was very different from the published one. The new gene set had a much reduced complement of unique proteins, better completeness values that were in line with other related species' genomes, and an increased number of proteins predicted to be secreted. It is thus likely that methodological issues drove the apparent uniqueness of the initial H. bacteriophora genome annotation and that similar contamination and misannotation issues affect other published genome assemblies.","Animals; Genome; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Nematoda; animal; genetics; genome; molecular genetics; nematode","","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059799184"

As is common in research using routine healthcare data, the service was historically delivered using ad-hoc processes resulting in the slow provision of data whose provenance was often hidden to the researchers using it. This paper describes the development and evaluation of the Research Data Management Platform (RDMP): an open source tool to load, manage, clean, and curate longitudinal healthcare data for research and provide reproducible and updateable datasets for defined cohorts to researchers. Results: Between 2013 and 2017, RDMP tool implementation tripled the productivity of data analysts producing data releases for researchers from 7.1 to 25.3 per month and reduced the error rate from 12.7% to 3.1%. The effort on data management reduced from a mean of 24.6 to 3.0 hours per data release. The waiting time for researchers to receive data after agreeing a specification reduced from approximately 6 months to less than 1 week. The software is scalable and currently manages 163 datasets. A total 1,321 data extracts for research have been produced, with the largest extract linking data from 70 different datasets. Conclusions: The tools and processes that encompass the RDMP not only fulfil the research data management requirements of researchers but also support the seamless collaboration of data cleaning, data transformation, data summarization and data quality assessment activities by different research groups. © The Author(s) 2018.

A major goal of these projects is to characterize these genetic variants to provide insight into their function and roles in diseases. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant RNA modifications in eukaryotes. Recent studies have revealed that aberrant m6A modifications are involved in many diseases. Findings: In this study, we present a user-friendly web server called “m6ASNP” that is dedicated to the identification of genetic variants that target m6A modification sites. A random forest model was implemented in m6ASNP to predict whether the methylation status of an m6A site is altered by the variants that surround the site. In m6ASNP, genetic variants in a standard variant call format (VCF) are accepted as the input data, and the output includes an interactive table that contains the genetic variants annotated by m6A function. In addition, statistical diagrams and a genome browser are provided to visualize the characteristics and to annotate the genetic variants. Conclusions: We believe that m6ASNP is a very convenient tool that can be used to boost further functional studies investigating genetic variants.

Decoding of every DNA element of the rice genome is essential for genetic improvement to address increasing food demands. The past 15 years have witnessed extraordinary advances in rice functional genomics. Systematic characterization and proper deposition of every rice gene are vital for both functional studies and crop genetic improvement. Findings: We built a comprehensive and accurate dataset of ~2800 functionally characterized rice genes and ~5000 members of different gene families by integrating data from available databases and reviewing every publication on rice functional genomic studies. The dataset accounts for 19.2% of the 39 045 annotated protein-coding rice genes, which provides the most exhaustive archive for investigating the functions of rice genes. We also constructed 214 gene interaction networks based on 1841 connections between 1310 genes. The largest network with 762 genes indicated that pleiotropic genes linked different biological pathways. Increasing degree of conservation of the flowering pathway was observed among more closely related plants, implying substantial value of rice genes for future dissection of flowering regulation in other crops. All data are deposited in the funRiceGenes database (https://funricegenes.github.io/). Functionality for advanced search and continuous updating of the database are provided by a Shiny application (http://funricegenes.ncpgr.cn/). Conclusions: The funRiceGenes dataset would enable further exploring of the crosslink between gene functions and natural variations in rice, which can also facilitate breeding design to improve target agronomic traits of rice. © The Author(s) 2017.","Chromosome Mapping; Databases, Genetic; Datasets as Topic; Flowers; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genes, Plant; Genetic Pleiotropy; Oryza; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Quantitative Trait Loci; Software; GABA transporter 1; amino acid metabolism; AMT1 gene; AMT3 gene; biogenesis; Brachypodium; CO3 gene; cross linking; Ehd4 gene; flowering; functional genomics; GAD3 gene; GAT1 gene; gene expression; gene function; gene interaction; gene locus; genetic improvement; genetic model; genetic resource; genetic variability; Hd6 gene; maize; nonhuman; Note; phenotype; PIL15 gene; plant gene; plant height; priority journal; RFT1 gene; rice; RNA interference; ROC4 gene; Se14 gene; sorghum; chromosomal mapping; classification; flower; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; genetic database; genetics; growth, development and aging; information processing; metabolism; Oryza; plant breeding; plant gene; pleiotropy; quantitative trait locus; software","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044597253"

There are increased analytical difficulties arising from working with a set of regions of interest that may be small in number and biologically dependent. Common statistical pipelines for RNA sequencing might be assumed to apply but can give misleading results on ATAC-cap-seq data. A tool is needed to allow a nonspecialist user to quickly and easily summarize data and apply sensible and effective normalization and analysis. Results: We developed atacR to allow a user to easily analyze their ATAC enrichment experiment. It provides comprehensive summary functions and diagnostic plots for studying enriched tag abundance. Application of between-sample normalization is made straightforward. Functions for normalizing based on user-defined control regions, whole library size, and regions selected from the least variable regions in a dataset are provided. Three methods for detecting differential abundance of tags from enriched methods are provided, including bootstrap t, Bayes factor, and a wrapped version of the standard exact test in the edgeR package. We compared the precision, recall, and F-score of each detection method on resampled datasets at varying replicate, significance threshold, and genes changed and found that the Bayes factor method had the greatest overall detection power, though edgeR was slightly stronger in simulations with lower numbers of genes changed. Conclusions: Our package allows a nonspecialist user to easily and effectively apply methods appropriate to the analysis of ATAC-cap-seq in a reproducible manner. The package is implemented in pure R and is fully interoperable with common workflows in Bioconductor. © The Author(s) 2018.

Here we present a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the new high-throughput sequencing platform BGISEQ-500 for metagenomic shotgun sequencing and compare its performance with that of 2 Illumina platforms. Findings: Using fecal samples from 20 healthy individuals, we evaluated the intra-platform reproducibility for metagenomic sequencing on the BGISEQ-500 platform in a setup comprising 8 library replicates and 8 sequencing replicates. Cross-platform consistency was evaluated by comparing 20 pairwise replicates on the BGISEQ-500 platform vs the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. In addition, we compared the performance of the 2 Illumina platforms against each other. By a newly developed overall accuracy quality control method, an average of 82.45 million high-quality reads (96.06% of raw reads) per sample, with 90.56% of bases scoring Q30 and above, was obtained using the BGISEQ-500 platform. Quantitative analyses revealed extremely high reproducibility between BGISEQ-500 intra-platform replicates. Cross-platform replicates differed slightly more than intra-platform replicates, yet a high consistency was observed. Only a low percentage (2.02%-3.25%) of genes exhibited significant differences in relative abundance comparing the BGISEQ-500 and HiSeq platforms, with a bias toward genes with higher GC content being enriched on the HiSeq platforms. Conclusions: Our study provides the first set of performance metrics for human gut metagenomic sequencing data using BGISEQ-500. The high accuracy and technical reproducibility confirm the applicability of the new platform for metagenomic studies, though caution is still warranted when combining metagenomic data from different platforms. © The Author(s) 2018.","Bacteria; Computational Biology; Feces; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Metagenomics; Sequence Analysis, DNA; adult; cohort analysis; comparative study; DNA extraction; feces analysis; gene; gene replication; gene sequence; high throughput sequencing; human; measurement accuracy; metagenomics; normal human; Note; priority journal; quality control; quantitative analysis; bacterium; biology; classification; DNA sequence; feces; genetics; high throughput sequencing; intestine flora; metagenomics; microbiology; procedures","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049644586"

Many Sillaginidae species, including the Chinese sillago (Sillago sinica), have been recently described in China, providing valuable material to analyze genetic diversification of the family Sillaginidae. Here, we constructed a reference genome for the Chinese sillago, with the aim to set up a platform for comparative analysis of all species in this family. Findings: Using the single-molecule real-time DNA sequencing platform Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Sequel, we generated ∼27.3 Gb genomic DNA sequences for the Chinese sillago. We reconstructed a genome assembly of 534 Mb using a strategy that takes advantage of complementary strengths of two genome assembly programs, Canu and FALCON. The genome size was consistent with the estimated genome size based on k-mer analysis. The assembled genome consisted of 802 contigs with a contig N50 length of 2.6 Mb. We annotated 22,122 protein-coding genes in the Chinese sillago genomes using a de novo method as well as RNA sequencing data and homologies to other teleosts. According to the phylogenetic analysis using protein-coding genes, the Chinese sillago is closely related to Larimichthys crocea and Dicentrarchus labrax and diverged from their ancestor around 69.5-82.6 million years ago. Conclusions: Using long reads generated with PacBio sequencing technology, we have built a draft genome assembly for the Chinese sillago, which is the first reference genome for Sillaginidae species. This genome assembly sets a stage for comparative analysis of the diversification and adaptation of fishes in Sillaginidae.  © The Author(s) 2018.","Animals; Fishes; Genome; animal; fish; genetics; genome","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055907236"

An example of a public repository is National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI's) Reference Sequence (RefSeq). These repositories must decide in what form to make their data available. Unstructured data can be put to almost any use but are limited in how access to them can be scaled. Highly structured data offer improved performance for specific algorithms but limit the wider usefulness of the data. We present an alternative: lightly structured data stored in Apache Kafka in a way that is amenable to parallel access and streamed processing, including subsequent transformations into more highly structured representations. We contend that this approach could provide a flexible and powerful nexus of bioinformatic data, bridging the gap between low structure on one hand, and high performance and scale on the other. To demonstrate this, we present a proof-of-concept version of NCBI's RefSeq database using this technology. We measure the performance and scalability characteristics of this alternative with respect to flat files. Results: The proof of concept scales almost linearly as more compute nodes are added, outperforming the standard approach using files. Conclusions: Apache Kafka merits consideration as a fast and more scalable but general-purpose way to store and retrieve bioinformatic data, for public, centralized reference datasets such as RefSeq and for private clinical and experimental data.","Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Information Storage and Retrieval; biology; genetic database; information retrieval","","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057901181"

The AA-type subgenome is derived from diploid wild peanut Arachis duranensis, and the BB-type subgenome is derived from diploid wild peanut Arachis ipaensis. A. monticola is regarded either as the direct progenitor of the cultivated peanut or as an introgressive derivative between the cultivated peanut and wild species. The large polyploidy genome structure and enormous nearly identical regions of the genome make the assembly of chromosomal pseudomolecules very challenging. Here we report the first reference quality assembly of the A. monticola genome, using a series of advanced technologies. The final whole genome of A. monticola is ~2.62 Gb and has a contig N50 and scaffold N50 of 106.66 Kb and 124.92 Mb, respectively. The vast majority (91.83%) of the assembled sequence was anchored onto the 20 pseudo-chromosomes, and 96.07% of assemblies were accurately separated into AA- and BBsubgenomes. We demonstrated efficiency of the current state of the strategy for de novo assembly of the highly complex allotetraploid species, wild peanut (A. monticola), based on whole-genome shotgun sequencing, single molecule real-time sequencing, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture technology, and BioNano optical genome maps. These combined technologies produced reference-quality genome of the allotetraploid wild peanut, which is valuable for understanding the peanut domestication and evolution within the Arachis genus and among legume crops. © The Author(s) 2018.

They are the most diverse (>16,000 species) of the strictly aquatic insect orders and are widely employed as bio-indicators in water quality assessment and monitoring. Among the numerous adaptations to aquatic habitats, caddisfly larvae use silk and materials from the environment (e.g., stones, sticks, leaf matter) to build composite structures such as fixed retreats and portable cases. Understanding how caddisflies have adapted to aquatic habitats will help explain the evolution and subsequent diversification of the group. Findings: We sequenced a retreat-builder caddisfly Stenopsyche tienmushanensis Hwang and assembled a high-quality genome from both Illumina and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing. In total, 601.2 M Illumina reads (90.2 Gb) and 16.9 M PacBio subreads (89.0 Gb) were generated. The 451.5 Mb assembled genome has a contig N50 of 1.29 M, has a longest contig of 4.76 Mb, and covers 97.65% of the 1,658 insect single-copy genes as assessed by Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs. The genome comprises 36.76% repetitive elements. A total of 14,672 predicted protein-coding genes were identified. The genome revealed gene expansions in specific groups of the cytochrome P450 family and olfactory binding proteins, suggesting potential genomic features associated with pollutant tolerance and mate finding. In addition, the complete gene complex of the highly repetitive H-fibroin, the major protein component of caddisfly larval silk, was assembled. Conclusions: We report the draft genome of Stenopsyche tienmushanensis, the highest-quality caddisfly genome so far. The genome information will be an important resource for the study of caddisflies and may shed light on the evolution of aquatic insects. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

Akin to other musk deer, the forest musk deer has been traditionally and is currently hunted for its musk (i.e., global perfume industry). Considerable hunting pressure and habitat loss have caused significant population declines. Consequently, the Chinese government commenced captive breeding programs for musk harvesting in the 1950s. However, the prevalence of fatal diseases is considerably restricting population increases. Disease severity and extent are exacerbated by inbreeding and genetic diversity declines in captive musk deer populations. It is essential that knowledge of captive and wild forest musk deer populations' immune system and genome be gained in order to improve their physical and genetic health. We have thus sequenced the whole genome of the forest musk deer, completed the genomic assembly and annotation, and performed preliminary bioinformatic analyses. Findings: A total of 407 Gb raw reads from whole-genome sequencing were generated using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. The final genome assembly is around 2.72 Gb, with a contig N50 length of 22.6 kb and a scaffold N50 length of 2.85 Mb. We identified 24,352 genes and found that 42.05% of the genome is composed of repetitive elements. We also detected 1,236 olfactory receptor genes. The genome-wide phylogenetic tree indicated that the forest musk deer was within the order Artiodactyla, and it appeared as the sister clade of four members of Bovidae. In total, 576 genes were under positive selection in the forest musk deer lineage. Conclusions: We provide the first genome sequence and gene annotation for the forest musk deer. The availability of these resources will be very useful for the conservation and captive breeding of this endangered and economically important species and for reconstructing the evolutionary history of the order Artiodactyla.  © The Author(s) 2018.","Animals; Deer; Endangered Species; Genome; Male; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Phylogeny; Whole Genome Sequencing; animal; deer; endangered species; genetics; genome; male; molecular genetics; phylogeny; whole genome sequencing","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059798086"

Despite the remarkable progress in our understanding of fern phylogeny, with conflicting molecular evidence and different morphological interpretations, relationships among major fern lineages remain controversial. Results:With the aim to obtain a robust fern phylogeny, we carried out a large-scale phylogenomic analysis using high-quality transcriptome sequencing data, which covered 69 fern species from 38 families and 11 orders. Both coalescent-based and concatenation-based methods were applied to both nucleotide and amino acid sequences in species tree estimation. The resulting topologies are largely congruent with each other, except for the placement of Angiopteris fokiensis, Cheiropleuria bicuspis, Diplaziopsis brunoniana, Matteuccia struthiopteris, Elaphoglossum mcclurei, and Tectaria subpedata. Conclusions: Our result confirmed that Equisetales is sister to the rest of ferns, and Dennstaedtiaceae is sister to eupolypods. Moreover, our result strongly supported some relationships different from the current view of fern phylogeny, including that Marattiaceae may be sister to the monophyletic clade of Psilotaceae and Ophioglossaceae; that Gleicheniaceae and Hymenophyllaceae form a monophyletic clade sister to Dipteridaceae; and that Aspleniaceae is sister to the rest of the groups in eupolypods II. These results were interpreted with morphological traits, especially sporangia characters, and a new evolutionary route of sporangial annulus in ferns was suggested. This backbone phylogeny in ferns sets a foundation for further studies in biology and evolution in ferns, and therefore in plants. © The Author(s) 2017.

Animal genomes are large and complex, and whole-genome alignment is a computationally intense process, requiring expensive high-performance computing systems due to the need to explore extensive local alignments. With hundreds of sequenced animal genomes available from multiple projects, there is an increasing demand for genome comparative analyses. Results: Here, we introduce G-Anchor, a new, fast, and efficient pipeline that uses a strictly limited but highly effective set of local sequence alignments to anchor (or map) an animal genome to another species' reference genome. G-Anchor makes novel use of a databank of highly conserved DNA sequence elements. We demonstrate how these elements may be aligned to a pair of genomes, creating anchors. These anchors enable the rapid mapping of scaffolds from a de novo assembled genome to chromosome assemblies of a reference species. Our results demonstrate that G-Anchor can successfully anchor a vertebrate genome onto a phylogenetically related reference species genome using a desktop or laptop computer within a few hours and with comparable accuracy to that achieved by a highly accurate whole-genome alignment tool such as LASTZ. G-Anchor thus makes whole-genome comparisons accessible to researchers with limited computational resources. Conclusions: G-Anchor is a ready-to-use tool for anchoring a pair of vertebrate genomes. It may be used with large genomes that contain a significant fraction of evolutionally conserved DNA sequences and that are not highly repetitive, polypoid, or excessively fragmented.

Results: Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing of 99 sheep and identified a primary genetic divergence between 2 heterogeneous populations in the Tibetan Plateau, including 1 semi-feral lineage. Selective sweep and candidate gene analysis revealed local adaptations of these sheep associated with sensory perception, muscle strength, eating habit, mating process, and aggressive behavior. In particular, a horn-related gene, RXFP2, showed signs of rapid evolution specifically in the semi-feral breeds. A unique haplotype and repressed horn-related tissue expression of RXFP2 were correlated with higher horn length, as well as spiral and horizontally extended horn shape. Conclusions: Semi-feralization has an extensive impact on diverse phenotypic traits of sheep. By acquiring features like those of their wild ancestors, semi-feral sheep were able to regain fitness while in frequent contact with wild surroundings and rare human interventions. This study provides a new insight into the evolution of domestic animals when human interventions are no longer dominant. © The Author(s) 2018.

However, long-read de novo assembly pipelines are computationally intense and require a considerable amount of coverage, thereby hindering their broad application to the assembly of large genomes. Alternatively, hybrid assembly methods that combine short- and long-read sequencing technologies can reduce the time and cost required to produce de novo assemblies of large genomes. Results: Here, we propose a new method, called Fast-SG, that uses a new ultrafast alignment-free algorithm specifically designed for constructing a scaffolding graph using light-weight data structures. Fast-SG can construct the graph from either short or long reads. This allows the reuse of efficient algorithms designed for short-read data and permits the definition of novel modular hybrid assembly pipelines. Using comprehensive standard datasets and benchmarks, we show how Fast-SG outperforms the state-of-the-art short-read aligners when building the scaffolding graph and can be used to extract linking information from either raw or error-corrected long reads. We also show how a hybrid assembly approach using Fast-SG with shallow long-read coverage (5X) and moderate computational resources can produce long-range and accurate reconstructions of the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana (Ler-0) and human (NA12878). Conclusions: Fast-SG opens a door to achieve accurate hybrid long-range reconstructions of large genomes with low effort, high portability, and low cost. © The Author(s) 2018.

Recently it has been used for scaffolding contigs and for assembly validation for large-scale sequencing projects, including the maize, goat, and Amborella genomes. However, a major impediment in the use of this data is the variety and quantity of errors in the raw optical mapping data, which are called Rmaps. The challenges associated with using Rmap data are analogous to dealing with insertions and deletions in the alignment of long reads. Moreover, they are arguably harder to tackle since the data are numerical and susceptible to inaccuracy. We develop cOMet to error correct Rmap data, which to the best of our knowledge is the only optical mapping error correction method. Our experimental results demonstrate that cOMet has high prevision and corrects 82.49% of insertion errors and 77.38% of deletion errors in Rmap data generated from the Escherichia coli K-12 reference genome. Out of the deletion errors corrected, 98.26% are true errors. Similarly, out of the insertion errors corrected, 82.19% are true errors. It also successfully scales to large genomes, improving the quality of 78% and 99% of the Rmaps in the plum and goat genomes, respectively. Last, we show the utility of error correction by demonstrating how it improves the assembly of Rmap data. Error corrected Rmap data results in an assembly that is more contiguous and covers a larger fraction of the genome. © The Author(s) 2018.

Instead, fasting hummingbirds switch to oxidizing stored lipids that are derived from ingested sugars. The hummingbird liver plays a key role in moderating energy homeostasis and this remarkable capacity for fuel switching. Additionally, liver is the principle location of de novo lipogenesis, which can occur at exceptionally high rates, such as during premigratory fattening. Yet understanding how this tissue and whole organism moderates energy turnover is hampered by a lack of information regarding how relevant enzymes differ in sequence, expression, and regulation. Findings: We generated a de novo transcriptome of the hummingbird liver using PacBio full-length cDNA sequencing (Iso-Seq), yielding 8.6Gb of sequencing data, or 2.6M reads from 4 different size fractions. We analyzed data using the SMRTAnalysis v3.1 Iso-Seq pipeline, then clustered isoforms into gene families to generate de novo gene contigs using Cogent. We performed orthology analysis to identify closely related sequences between our transcriptome and other avian and human gene sets. Finally, we closely examined homology of critical lipid metabolism genes between our transcriptome data and avian and human genomes. Conclusions: We confirmed high levels of sequence divergence within hummingbird lipogenic enzymes, suggesting a high probability of adaptive divergent function in the hepatic lipogenic pathways. Our results leverage cutting-edge technology and a novel bioinformatics pipeline to provide a first direct look at the transcriptome of this incredible organism. © The Author(s) 2018.","Animals; Birds; Computational Biology; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Profiling; Liver; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Single Molecule Imaging; Transcriptome; complementary DNA; contig; transcriptome; transcriptome; adult; alternative RNA splicing; animal tissue; Archilochus colubris; bird; cell metabolism; gene sequence; genetic transcription; genetic variability; lipid metabolism; male; multigene family; nonhuman; Note; orthology; priority journal; sequence homology; animal; biology; DNA sequence; energy metabolism; gene expression profiling; genetics; liver; metabolism; molecular genetics; procedures; sequence analysis; single molecule imaging","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050732073"

With whole-genome sequencing, variations in coding and non-coding sequences can be discovered. But the cost associated with it is currently limiting its general use in research. Whole-exome sequencing is used to characterize sequence variations in coding regions, but the cost associated with capture reagents and biases in capture rate limit its full use in research. Additional limitations include uncertainty in assigning the functional significance of the mutations when these mutations are observed in the non-coding region or in genes that are not expressed in cancer tissue. Results: We investigated the feasibility of uncovering mutations from expressed genes using RNA sequencing datasets with a method called Variant Detection in RNA(VaDiR) that integrates 3 variant callers, namely: SNPiR, RVBoost, and MuTect2. The combination of all 3 methods, which we called Tier 1 variants, produced the highest precision with true positive mutations from RNA-seq that could be validated at the DNA level. We also found that the integration of Tier 1 variants with those called by MuTect2 and SNPiR produced the highest recall with acceptable precision. Finally, we observed a higher rate of mutation discovery in genes that are expressed at higher levels. Conclusions: Our method, VaDiR, provides a possibility of uncovering mutations from RNA sequencing datasets that could be useful in further functional analysis. In addition, our approach allows orthogonal validation of DNA-based mutation discovery by providing complementary sequence variation analysis from paired RNA/DNA sequencing datasets. © The Author(s) 2017.","Base Pairing; Datasets as Topic; DNA, Neoplasm; Female; Genetic Variation; Genome, Human; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Mutation; Ovarian Neoplasms; RNA, Neoplasm; Software; Transcriptome; DNA; messenger RNA; RNA; DNA; RNA; transcriptome; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer tissue; clinical article; controlled study; DNA integration; drug resistance; false negative result; false positive result; feasibility study; female; gene expression; gene mutation; genetic code; genetic variability; genome; human; human tissue; intermethod comparison; ovary cancer; priority journal; RNA analysis; RNA sequence; whole exome sequencing; workflow; base pairing; genetic variation; genetics; high throughput sequencing; human genome; information processing; mutation; ovary tumor; software; statistics and numerical data","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043394640"

The complex homoeologous gene expression could have been evolutionarily advantageous for the adaptation of allopolyploid plants. Despite multiple previous studies reporting homoeolog-specific gene expression in allopolyploid species, there are no clear examples of homoeolog-specific function in acclimation to a long-term stress condition. Results: We found that the allopolyploid grass Brachypodium hybridum and its ancestor Brachypodium stacei show long-term heat stress tolerance, unlike its other ancestor, Brachypodium distachyon. To understand the physiological traits of B. hybridum, we compared the transcriptome of the 3 Brachypodium species grown under normal and heat stress conditions. We found that the expression patterns of approximately 26% and approximately 38% of the homoeolog groups in B. hybridum changed toward nonadditive expression and nonancestral expression, respectively, under normal condition. Moreover, we found that B. distachyon showed similar expression patterns between normal and heat stress conditions, whereas B. hybridum and B. stacei significantly altered their transcriptome in response to heat after 3 days of stress exposure, and homoeologs that were inherited from B. stacei may have contributed to the transcriptional stress response to heat in B. hybridum. After 15 days of heat exposure, B. hybridum and B. stacei maintained transcriptional states similar to those under normal conditions. These results suggest that an earlier response to heat that was specific to homoeologs originating from B. stacei contributed to cellular homeostasis under long-term heat stress in B. hybridum. Conclusions: Our results provide insights into different regulatory events of the homoeo-transcriptome that are associated with stress acclimation in allopolyploid plants.","Acclimatization; Brachypodium; DNA Probes; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genome, Plant; Hot Temperature; Ploidies; Transcriptome; transcriptome; acclimatization; Brachypodium; DNA probe; gene expression regulation; heat; physiology; plant genome; ploidy","","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052098374"

Only 18 survived by the end of the 19th century, and the current population of 4500 individuals was propagated from just 11 kept by the 11th British Duke of Bedford. This species is known for its distinguishable appearance, the driving force behind which is still a mystery. To aid efforts to explore these phenomena, we constructed a draft genome of the species. Findings: In total, we generated 321.86 gigabases (Gb) of raw DNA sequence from whole-genome sequencing of a male milu deer using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Assembly yielded a final genome with a scaffold N50 size of 3.03 megabases (Mb) and a total length of 2.52 Gb. Moreover, we identified 20 125 protein-coding genes and 988.1 Mb of repetitive sequences. In addition, homology-based searches detected 280 rRNA, 1335 miRNA, 1441 snRNA, and 893 tRNA sequences in the milu genome. The divergence time between E. davidianus and Bos taurus was estimated to be about 28.20 million years ago (Mya). We identified 167 species-specific genes and 293 expanded gene families in the milu lineage.

Here, we report the 542 Mb draft genome sequence of an up to 300-year-old individual (Bhaga) from an undisturbed stand in the Kellerwald-Edersee National Park in central Germany. Findings: Using a hybrid assembly approach, Illumina reads with short- and long-insert libraries, coupled with long Pacific Biosciences reads, we obtained an assembled genome size of 542 Mb, in line with flow cytometric genome size estimation. The largest scaffold was of 1.15 Mb, the N50 length was 145 kb, and the L50 count was 983. The assembly contained 0.12% of Ns. A Benchmarking with Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis retrieved 94% complete BUSCO genes, well in the range of other high-quality draft genomes of trees. A total of 62,012 protein-coding genes were predicted, assisted by transcriptome sequencing. In addition, we are reporting an efficient method for extracting high-molecular-weight DNA from dormant buds, by which contamination by environmental bacteria and fungi was kept at a minimum. Conclusions: The assembled genome will be a valuable resource and reference for future population genomics studies on the evolution and past climate change adaptation of beech and will be helpful for identifying genes, e.g., involved in drought tolerance, in order to select and breed individuals to adapt forestry to climate change in Europe.

PP2ACdc55 phosphatase has been extensively related to cell cycle events in budding yeast; however, few PP2ACdc55 substrates have been identified. Here, we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry approach to reveal new substrates of PP2ACdc55 phosphatase and new PP2A-related processes in mitotic arrested cells. Results: We identified 62 statistically significant PP2ACdc55 substrates involved mainly in actin-cytoskeleton organization. In addition, we validated new PP2ACdc55 substrates such as Slk19 and Lte1, involved in early and late anaphase pathways, and Zeo1, a component of the cell wall integrity pathway. Finally, we constructed docking models of Cdc55 and its substrate Mob1. We found that the predominant interface on Cdc55 is mediated by a protruding loop consisting of residues 84-90, thus highlighting the relevance of these aminoacids for substrate interaction. Conclusions: We used phosphoproteomics of Cdc55-deficient cells to uncover new PP2ACdc55 substrates and functions in mitosis. As expected, several hyperphosphorylated proteins corresponded to Cdk1-dependent substrates, although other kinases' consensus motifs were also enriched in our dataset, suggesting that PP2ACdc55 counteracts and regulates other kinases distinct from Cdk1. Indeed, Pkc1 emerged as a novel node of PP2ACdc55 regulation, highlighting a major role of PP2ACdc55 in actin cytoskeleton and cytokinesis, gene ontology terms significantly enriched in the PP2ACdc55-dependent phosphoproteome. © The Author(s) 2018.","Amino Acid Sequence; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cytokinesis; Endocytosis; Gene Ontology; Isotope Labeling; Metaphase; Molecular Docking Simulation; Phosphoproteins; Phosphorylation; Protein Binding; Protein Interaction Maps; Protein Phosphatase 2; Proteome; Proteomics; Reproducibility of Results; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Saccharomycetales; Substrate Specificity; cyclin dependent kinase 1; Mob1 protein; peptides and proteins; phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A; protein kinase C; protein kinase C1; unclassified drug; CDC55 protein, S cerevisiae; cell cycle protein; phosphoprotein; phosphoprotein phosphatase 2; protein binding; proteome; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; actin filament; Article; budding yeast; controlled study; endocytosis; enzyme regulation; enzyme substrate; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; isotope labeling; limit of quantitation; M phase cell cycle checkpoint; mass spectrometry; molecular docking; nonhuman; phosphoproteomics; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; stable isotope labelling by amino acid in cell culture technique; amino acid sequence; budding yeast; chemistry; cytokinesis; enzyme specificity; gene ontology; isotope labeling; metabolism; metaphase; phosphorylation; procedures; protein analysis; proteomics; reproducibility","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053867260"

Several genome-wide studies have been carried out for endemic vertebrates in Tibet, including mammals, birds, and amphibians. However, little information is available about the adaptive evolution of highland fishes. Glyptosternon maculatum (Regan 1905), also known as Regan or barkley and endemic to the Tibetan Plateau, belongs to the Sisoridae family, order Siluriformes (catfishes). This species lives at an elevation ranging from roughly 2,800 m to 4,200 m. Hence, a high-quality reference genome of G. maculatum provides an opportunity to investigate high-altitude adaption mechanisms of fishes. Findings: To obtain a high-quality reference genome sequence of G. maculatum, we combined Pacific Bioscience single-molecule real-time sequencing, Illumina paired-end sequencing, 10X Genomics linked-reads, and BioNano optical map techniques. In total, 603.99 Gb sequencing data were generated. The assembled genome was about 662.34 Mb with scaffold and contig N50 sizes of 20.90 Mb and 993.67 kb, respectively, which captured 83% complete and 3.9% partial vertebrate Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs. Repetitive elements account for 35.88% of the genome, and 22,066 protein-coding genes were predicted from the genome, of which 91.7% have been functionally annotated. Conclusions: We present the first comprehensive de novo genome of G. maculatum. This genetic resource is fundamental for investigating the origin of G. maculatum and will improve our understanding of high-altitude adaption of fishes.

First, we tried to re-run the analysis with the code and data provided by the authors. Second, we reimplemented the whole method in a Python package to avoid dependency on a MATLAB license and ease the execution of the code on a high-performance computing cluster. Third, we assessed reusability of our reimplementation and the quality of our documentation, testing how easy it would be to start from our implementation to reproduce the results. In a second section, we propose solutions from this case study and other observations to improve reproducibility and research efficiency at the individual and collective levels.

With few molecular resources, breeding is still restricted to traditional phenotypic selection, and the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation remain unknown. Hence, a high-quality reference genome will be very valuable for marker-assisted breeding, genome editing, and molecular genetics. Findings: We generated 66 Gb and 37 Gb of raw DNA sequences, respectively, from whole-genome sequencing of a largely homozygous scarlet sage inbred line using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) single-molecule real-time and Illumina HiSeq sequencing platforms. The PacBio de novo assembly yielded a final genome with a scaffold N50 size of 3.12 Mb and a total length of 808 Mb. The repetitive sequences identified accounted for 57.52% of the genome sequence, and 54,008 protein-coding genes were predicted collectively with ab initio and homology-based gene prediction from the masked genome. The divergence time between S. splendens and Salvia miltiorrhiza was estimated at 28.21 million years ago (Mya). Moreover, 3,797 species-specific genes and 1,187 expanded gene families were identified for the scarlet sage genome. Conclusions: We provide the first genome sequence and gene annotation for the scarlet sage.

Neurobehavioral studies of Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata domestica) song, naturally more variable and plastic than songs of other finch species, have demonstrated the importance of behavioral variability for initial learning, maintenance, and plasticity of vocalizations. However, the molecular and genetic underpinnings of this variability and the learning it supports are poorly understood. Findings: To establish a platform for the molecular analysis of behavioral variability and plasticity, we generated an initial draft assembly of the Bengalese finch genome from a single male animal to 151 × coverage and an N50 of 3.0 MB. Furthermore, we developed an initial set of gene models using RNA-seq data from 8 samples that comprise liver, muscle, cerebellum, brainstem/midbrain, and forebrain tissue from juvenile and adult Bengalese finches of both sexes. Conclusions: We provide a draft Bengalese finch genome and gene annotation to facilitate the study of the molecular-genetic influences on behavioral variability and the process of vocal learning. These data will directly support many avenues for the identification of genes involved in learning, including differential expression analysis, comparative genomic analysis (through comparison to existing avian genome assemblies), and derivation of genetic maps for linkage analysis. Bengalese finch gene models and sequences will be essential for subsequent manipulation (molecular or genetic) of genes and gene products, enabling novel mechanistic investigations into the role of variability in learned behavior. © The Author(s) 2018.","Animals; Finches; Genome; Learning; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Motor Skills; Sequence Analysis, DNA; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; cerebellum; conditioning; female; finch; forebrain tissue; gene expression; gene mapping; juvenile; linkage analysis; liver; male; male animal; mesencephalon; motor performance; muscle; nerve cell plasticity; neuroscience; nonhuman; note; vocal learning; animal; DNA sequence; finch; genetics; genome; learning; molecular genetics; motor performance; physiology; procedures","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050764939"

This plant species exhibits extremely high tolerance to drought and freezing and has been used in abiotic tolerance research in plants. As a relic of the tertiary period, A. nanus is of great significance to plant biogeographic research in the ancient Mediterranean region. Here, we report a draft genome assembly using the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform and gene annotation for A. nanus. Findings: A total of 64.72 Gb of raw PacBio sequel reads were generated from four 20-kb libraries. After filtering, 64.53 Gb of clean reads were obtained, giving 72.59× coverage depth. Assembly using Canu gave an assembly length of 823.74 Mb, with a contig N50 of 2.76 Mb. The final size of the assembled A. nanus genome was close to the 889 Mb estimated by k-mer analysis. The gene annotation completeness was evaluated using Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs; 1,327 of the 1,440 conserved genes (92.15%) could be found in the A. nanus assembly. Genome annotation revealed that 74.08% of the A. nanus genome is composed of repetitive elements and 53.44% is composed of long terminal repeat elements. We predicted 37,188 protein-coding genes, of which 96.53% were functionally annotated.

Results: Populations were structured into five genetic lineages on the mainland and Hainan Island, recapitulating current subspecies designations. These subspecies are estimated to have diverged 125.8 to 51.3 thousand years ago, but feature recent gene flow. Consistent with the expectation of a larger body size in colder climates and smaller body size in warmer climates (Bergman's rule), the northernmost RM lineage (M. m. tcheliensis), possessing the largest body size of all Chinese RMs, and the southernmost lineage (M. m. brevicaudus), with the smallest body size of all Chinese RMs, feature positively selected genes responsible for skeletal development. Further, two candidate selected genes (Fbp1, Fbp2) found in M. m. tcheliensis are involved in gluconeogenesis, potentially maintaining stable blood glucose levels during starvation when food resources are scarce in winter. The tropical subspecies M. m. brevicaudus showed positively selected genes related to cardiovascular function and response to temperature stimuli, potentially involved in tropical adaptation. We found 118 single-nucleotide polymorphisms matching human disease-causing variants with 82 being subspecies specific. Conclusions: These data provide a resource for selection of RMs in biomedical experiments. The demographic history of Chinese RMs and their history of local adaption offer new insights into their evolution and provide valuable baseline information for biomedical investigation.  © The Author(s) 2018.","Acclimatization; Animals; Biomedical Research; China; Genetics, Population; Humans; Macaca mulatta; acclimatization; animal; China; genetics; human; medical research; population genetics; rhesus monkey","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055910369"

Many variants of these protocols have been developed, each with their own strengths. Currently there is no systematic means for simulating sequence data from this family of sequencing protocols, potentially hindering the advancement of algorithms to exploit this new datatype. Findings: We describe a computational simulator that, given simple parameters and reference genome sequences, will simulate Hi-C sequencing on those sequences. The simulator models the basic spatial structure in genomes that is commonly observed in Hi-C and 3C datasets, including the distance-decay relationship in proximity ligation, differences in the frequency of interaction within and across chromosomes, and the structure imposed by cells. A means to model the 3D structure of randomly generated topologically associating domains is provided. The simulator considers several sources of error common to 3C and Hi-C library preparation and sequencing methods, including spurious proximity ligation events and sequencing error. Conclusions: We have introduced the first comprehensive simulator for 3C and Hi-C sequencing protocols. We expect the simulator to have use in testing of Hi-C data analysis algorithms, as well as more general value for experimental design, where questions such as the required depth of sequencing, enzyme choice, and other decisions can be made in advance in order to ensure adequate statistical power with respect to experimental hypothesis testing. © The Author(s) 2017.","Algorithms; Bacteria; Chromosome Mapping; Computer Simulation; Fungi; Genome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Models, Statistical; DNA; Article; chromosome; conformation; controlled study; DNA sequence; error; gene library; genetic algorithm; genetic database; genome; metagenomics; nonhuman; priority journal; simulation; software; algorithm; bacterium; chromosomal mapping; computer simulation; fungus; genetics; genome; high throughput sequencing; statistical model; statistics and numerical data","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046156744"

Feather and skin are ideal tissues to explore the genomics and complexity of color patterns in vertebrates. Two species of the genus Chrysolophus, golden pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus) and Lady Amherst's pheasant (Chrysolophus amherstiae), exhibit brilliant colors in their plumage, but with extreme phenotypic differences, making these two species great models to investigate plumage coloration mechanisms in birds. Results: We sequenced and assembled a genome of golden pheasant with high coverage and annotated 15,552 protein-coding genes. The genome of Lady Amherst's pheasant is sequenced with low coverage. Based on the feather pigment identification, a series of genomic and transcriptomic comparisons were conducted to investigate the complex features of plumage coloration. By identifying the lineage-specific sequence variations in Chrysolophus and golden pheasant against different backgrounds, we found that four melanogenesis biosynthesis genes and some lipid-related genes might be candidate genomic factors for the evolution of melanin and carotenoid pigmentation, respectively. In addition, a study among 47 birds showed some candidate genes related to carotenoid coloration in a broad range of birds. The transcriptome data further reveal important regulators of the two colorations, particularly one splicing transcript of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor gene for pheomelanin synthesis. Conclusions: Analysis of the golden pheasant and its sister pheasant genomes, as well as comparison with other avian genomes, are helpful to reveal the underlying regulation of their plumage coloration. The present study provides important genomic information and insights for further studies of avian plumage evolution and diversity.  © The Author(s) 2018.","Alternative Splicing; Animals; Birds; Carotenoids; Computational Biology; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression Profiling; Genome; Genomics; Keratins; Melanins; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Phenotype; Pigmentation; Transcriptome; carotenoid; keratin; melanin; transcriptome; alternative RNA splicing; animal; biology; bird; gene expression profiling; genetics; genome; genomics; metabolism; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; phenotype; physiology; pigmentation; procedures","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055613358"

This pheasant provides an opportunity to investigate evolutionary processes following geographic isolation. Currently, the genetic background and adaptive evolution of the Mikado pheasant remain unclear. Results: We present the draft genome of the Mikado pheasant, which consists of 1.04 Gb of DNA and 15,972 annotated protein-coding genes. The Mikado pheasant displays expansion and positive selection of genes related to features that contribute to its adaptive evolution, such as energy metabolism, oxygen transport, hemoglobin binding, radiation response, immune response, and DNA repair. To investigate the molecular evolution of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) across several avian species, 39 putative genes spanning 227 kb on a contiguous region were annotated and manually curated. The MHC loci of the pheasant revealed a high level of synteny, several rapidly evolving genes, and inverse regions compared to the same loci in the chicken. The complete mitochondrial genome was also sequenced, assembled, and compared against four long-tailed pheasants. The results from molecular clock analysis suggest that ancestors of the Mikado pheasant migrated from the north to Taiwan about 3.47 million years ago. Conclusions: This study provides a valuable genomic resource for the Mikado pheasant, insights into its adaptation to high altitude, and the evolutionary history of the genus Syrmaticus, which could potentially be useful for future studies that investigate molecular evolution, genomics, ecology, and immunogenetics. © 2018 Oxford University Press.

Delineating the complete sequences of such plasmids could provide valuable insight into the evolution and transmission mechanisms underlying bacterial antibiotic resistance development. However, due to the presence of multiple repeats of mobile elements, complete sequencing of MDR plasmids remains technically complicated, expensive, and time-consuming. Results: Here, we demonstrate a rapid and efficient approach to obtaining multiple MDR plasmid sequences through the use of the MinION nanopore sequencing platform, which is incorporated in a portable device. By assembling the long sequencing reads generated by a single MinION run according to a rapid barcoding sequencing protocol, we obtained the complete sequences of 20 plasmids harbored by multiple bacterial strains. Importantly, single long reads covering a plasmid end-to-end were recorded, indicating that de novo assembly may be unnecessary if the single reads exhibit high accuracy.

Given that many public health decisions and health care policies are based on ES estimates, it is important to assess how ESs are used in the biomedical literature and to investigate potential trends in their reporting over time. Results: Through a big data approach, the text mining process automatically extracted 814 120 ESs from 13 322 754 PubMed abstracts. Eligible ESs were risk ratio, odds ratio, and hazard ratio, along with their confidence intervals. Here we show a remarkable decrease of ES values in PubMed abstracts between 1990 and 2015 while, concomitantly, results become more often statistically significant. Medians of ES values have decreased over time for both ""risk"" and ""protective"" values. This trend was found in nearly all fields of biomedical research, with the most marked downward tendency in genetics. Over the same period, the proportion of statistically significant ESs increased regularly: among the abstracts with at least 1 ES, 74% were statistically significant in 1990-1995, vs 85% in 2010-2015. Conclusions: whereas decreasing ESs could be an intrinsic evolution in biomedical research, the concomitant increase of statistically significant results is more intriguing. Although it is likely that growing sample sizes in biomedical research could explain these results, another explanation may lie in the ""publish or perish"" context of scientific research, with the probability of a growing orientation toward sensationalism in research reports.

For this reason, transcriptome analyses from various developmental stages of echiurid species can be of substantial value for understanding precise expression levels and the complex regulatory networks during early and larval development. Results: A total of 914 million raw RNA-Seq reads were produced from 14 developmental stages of Urechis unicinctus and were de novo assembled into contigs spanning 63,928,225 bp with an N50 length of 2700 bp. The resulting comprehensive transcriptome database of the early developmental stages of U. unicinctus consists of 20,305 representative functional protein-coding transcripts. Approximately 66% of unigenes were assigned to superphylum-level taxa, including Lophotrochozoa (40%). The completeness of the transcriptome assembly was assessed using benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs; 75.7% of the single-copy orthologs were presented in our transcriptome database. We observed 3 distinct patterns of global transcriptome profiles from 14 developmental stages and identified 12,705 genes that showed dynamic regulation patterns during the differentiation and maturation of U. unicinctus cells. Conclusions: We present the first large-scale developmental transcriptome dataset of U. unicinctus and provide a general overview of the dynamics of global gene expression changes during its early developmental stages.

A comprehensive prediction of potential active regulatory regions is necessary to functionally study the roles of the majority of genomic variants in evolution, domestication, and animal production. We developed a computational method to predict regulatory DNA sequences (promoters, enhancers, and transcription factor binding sites) in production animals (cows and pigs) and extended its broad applicability to other mammals. The method utilizes human regulatory features identified from thousands of tissues, cell lines, and experimental assays to find homologous regions that are conserved in sequences and genome organization and are enriched for regulatory elements in the genome sequences of other mammalian species. Importantly, we developed a filtering strategy, including a machine learning classification method, to utilize a very small number of species-specific experimental datasets available to select for the likely active regulatory regions. The method finds the optimal combination of sensitivity and accuracy to unbiasedly predict regulatory regions in mammalian species.

The format includes a known filesystem structure, a definition for a set of environment variables describing it, and functions for generation of the variables and interaction with the libraries, metadata, and executables located within. SCIF makes it easy to expose metadata, multiple environments, installation steps, files, and entry points to render scientific applications consistent, modular, and discoverable. A SCIF can be installed on a traditional host or in a container technology such as Docker or Singularity. We start by reviewing the background and rationale for the SCIF, followed by an overview of the specification and the different levels of internal modules (""apps"") that the organizational format affords. Finally, we demonstrate that SCIF is useful by implementing and discussing several use cases that improve user interaction and understanding of scientific applications. SCIF is released along with a client and integration in the Singularity 2.4 software to quickly install and interact with SCIF. When used inside of a reproducible container, a SCIF is a recipe for reproducibility and introspection of the functions and users that it serves. Results: We use SCIF to evaluate container software, provide metrics, serve scientific workflows, and execute a primary function under different contexts. To encourage collaboration and sharing of applications, we developed tools along with an open source, version-controlled, tested, and programmatically accessible web infrastructure. SCIF and associated resources are available at https://sci-f.github.io. The ease of using SCIF, especially in the context of containers, offers promise for scientists' work to be self-documenting and programatically parseable for maximum reproducibility. SCIF opens up an abstraction from underlying programming languages and packaging logic to work with scientific applications, opening up new opportunities for scientific software development.","Information Storage and Retrieval; Metadata; Programming Languages; Science; Software; Workflow; computer language; information retrieval; metadata; science; software; workflow","","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053148153"

Findings: We generated CRISPR-guided DNA methyltransferases by fusing the catalytic domain of DNMT3A or DNMT3B to the C terminus of the dCas9 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes and validated its on-target and global off-target characteristics. Using targeted quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing, we prove that dCas9-BFP-DNMT3A and dCas9-BFP-DNMT3B can efficiently methylate the CpG dinucleotides flanking its target sites at different genomic loci (uPA and TGFBR3) in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T). Furthermore, we conducted whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to address the specificity of our dCas9 methyltransferases. WGBS revealed that although dCas9-BFP-DNMT3A and dCas9-BFP-DNMT3B did not cause global methylation changes, a substantial number (more than 1000) of the off-target differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified. The off-target DMRs, which were hypermethylated in cells expressing dCas9 methyltransferase and guide RNAs, were predominantly found in promoter regions, 5' untranslated regions, CpG islands, and DNase I hypersensitivity sites, whereas unexpected hypomethylated off-target DMRs were significantly enriched in repeated sequences. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation with massive parallel DNA sequencing analysis, we further revealed that these off-target DMRs were weakly correlated with dCas9 off-target binding sites. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RNA sequencing, and fluorescence reporter cells, we also found that dCas9-BFP-DNMT3A and dCas9-BFP-DNMT3B can mediate transient inhibition of gene expression, which might be caused by dCas9-mediated de novo DNA methylation as well as interference with transcription. Conclusions: Our results prove that dCas9 methyltransferases cause efficient RNA-guided methylation of specific endogenous CpGs. However, there is significant off-target methylation indicating that further improvements of the specificity of CRISPR-dCas9 based DNA methylation modifiers are required. © The Author(s) 2018.","CpG Islands; CRISPR-Cas Systems; DNA Methylation; Genome; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Methyltransferases; RNA, Guide; DNA methyltransferase 3A; DNA methyltransferase 3B; transforming growth factor beta3; urokinase; guide RNA; methyltransferase; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; CpG island; CRISPR-CAS9 system; DNA methylation; DNA sequence; embryo; gene locus; genome-wide association study; human; human cell; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; pyrosequencing; Streptococcus pyogenes; TGFBR3 gene; uPA gene; whole genome bisulfite sequencing; whole genome sequencing; CRISPR Cas system; DNA methylation; genetics; genome; HEK293 cell line","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050764662"

This creates challenges for e-infrastructures accustomed to hosting computationally mature research in other sciences. Using data gathered from our own clusters at UPPMAX computing center at Uppsala University, Sweden, where core hour usage of ∼800 NGS and ∼200 non-NGS projects is now similar, we compare and contrast the growth, administrative burden, and cluster usage of NGS projects with projects from other sciences. Results: The number of NGS projects has grown rapidly since 2010, with growth driven by entry of new research groups. Storage used by NGS projects has grown more rapidly since 2013 and is now limited by disk capacity. NGS users submit nearly twice as many support tickets per user, and 11 more tools are installed each month for NGS projects than for non-NGS projects. We developed usage and efficiency metrics and show that computing jobs for NGS projects use more RAM than non-NGS projects, are more variable in core usage, and rarely span multiple nodes. NGS jobs use booked resources less efficiently for a variety of reasons. Active monitoring can improve this somewhat. Conclusions: Hosting NGS projects imposes a large administrative burden at UPPMAX due to large numbers of inexperienced users and diverse and rapidly evolving research areas. We provide a set of recommendations for e-infrastructures that host NGS research projects. We provide anonymized versions of our storage, job, and efficiency databases.","Biological Science Disciplines; Computational Biology; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Research; Software; biology; biomedicine; high throughput sequencing; procedures; research; software","","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056730284"

Two genetically distinct lineages (assemblages A and B) are responsible for the human disease. Although it is clear that differences in virulence occur, the pathogenesis and virulence of Giardia remain poorly understood. Results: The genome of Giardia is believed to contain open reading frames that could encode as many as 6000 proteins. By successfully applying quantitative proteomic analyses to the whole parasite and to the supernatants derived from parasite culture of assemblages A and B, we confirm expression of ~1600 proteins from each assemblage, the vast majority of which are common to both lineages. To look for signature enrichment of secreted proteins, we considered the ratio of proteins in the supernatant compared with the pellet, which defined a small group of enriched proteins, putatively secreted at a steady state by cultured growing trophozoites of both assemblages. This secretome is enriched with proteins annotated to have N-terminal signal peptide. The most abundant secreted proteins include known virulence factors such as cathepsin B cysteine proteases and members of a Giardia superfamily of cysteine-rich proteins that comprise variant surface proteins, high-cysteine membrane proteins, and a new class of virulence factors, the Giardia tenascins. We demonstrate that physiological function of human enteric epithelial cells is disrupted by such soluble factors even in the absence of the trophozoites. Conclusions: We are able to propose a straightforward model of Giardia pathogenesis incorporating key roles for the major Giardia-derived soluble mediators. © The Author(s) 2018.","Animals; Cell Lineage; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Gastroenteritis; Genome; Genotype; Giardia; Giardiasis; Humans; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Phylogeny; Proteomics; Tenascin; cathepsin B; tenascin; nerve protein; neuronectin; scleroprotein; tenascin; Article; cell lineage; controlled study; gastroenteritis; genetic code; Giardia intestinalis; giardiasis; human; human cell; intestine cell; microbial genome; molecular genetics; nonhuman; open reading frame; parasite virulence; pathogenesis; phylogeny; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; protein secretion; proteomics; quantitative analysis; trophozoite; animal; genetics; genome; genotype; Giardia; giardiasis; parasitology; pathogenicity; secretion (process)","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050726583"

Specifically, brain atlases allow annotation of gene expression, cell morphology, connectivity, and activity. In larval zebrafish, advances in genetics, imaging, and computational methods now allow the collection of such information brain-wide. However, due to technical considerations, disparate datasets may use different references and may not be aligned to the same coordinate space. Two recent larval zebrafish atlases exemplify this problem: Z-Brain, containing gene expression, neural activity, and neuroanatomical segmentations, was acquired using immunohistochemical stains, while the Zebrafish Brain Browser (ZBB) was constructed from live scans of fluorescent reporters in transgenic larvae. Although different references were used, the atlases included several common transgenic patterns that provide potential ""bridges"" for transforming each into the other's coordinate space. We tested multiple bridging channels and registration algorithms and found that the symmetric diffeomorphic normalization algorithm improved live brain registration precision while better preserving cell morphology than B-spline-based registrations. Symmetric diffeomorphic normalization also corrected for tissue distortion introduced during fixation. Multi-reference channel optimization provided a transformation that enabled Z-Brain and ZBB to be co-aligned with precision of approximately a single cell diameter and minimal perturbation of cell and tissue morphology. Finally, we developed software to visualize brain regions in 3 dimensions, including a virtual reality neuroanatomy explorer. This study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating whole brain datasets, despite disparate reference templates and acquisition protocols, when sufficient information is present for bridging. Increased accuracy and interoperability of zebrafish digital brain atlases will facilitate neurobiological studies. © The Author 2017.

In this study, we report the whole genome sequence of the Murray cod to support ongoing population genetics, conservation, and management research, as well as to better understand the evolutionary ecology and history of the species. A draft Murray cod genome of 633 Mbp (N50 = 109 974bp; BUSCO and CEGMA completeness of 94.2% and 91.9%, respectively) with an estimated 148 Mbp of putative repetitive sequences was assembled from the combined sequencing data of 2 fish individuals with an identical maternal lineage 47.2 Gb of Illumina HiSeq data and 804 Mb of Nanopore data were generated from the first individual while 23.2 Gb of Illumina MiSeq data were generated from the second individual.

It is an obligate semi-aquatic, viviparous, diurnal species restricted to specific portions of mountainous locations in southwestern China and northeastern Vietnam. However, in the past several decades, this species has undergone a rapid decrease in population size due to illegal poaching and habitat disruption, making this unique reptile species endangered and listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ofWild Fauna and Flora Appendix II since 1990. A proposal to uplist it to Appendix I was passed at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Seventeenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties in 2016. To promote the conservation of this species, we sequenced the genome of a male Chinese crocodile lizard using a whole-genome shotgun strategy on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. In total, we generated ~291 Gb of raw sequencing data (×149 depth) from 13 libraries with insert sizes ranging from 250 bp to 40 kb. After filtering for polymerase chain reaction-duplicated and low-quality reads, ~137 Gb of clean data (×70 depth) were obtained for genome assembly. We yielded a draft genome assembly with a total length of 2.24 Gb and an N50 scaffold size of 1.47 Mb. The assembled genome was predicted to contain 20 150 protein-coding genes and up to 1114 Mb (49.6%) of repetitive elements. The genomic resource of the Chinese crocodile lizard will contribute to deciphering the biology of this organism and provides an essential tool for conservation efforts. It also provides a valuable resource for future study of squamate evolution. © The Author 2017.

In the past few years, increasing numbers of studies have been published on the potential pharmacological activities of R. crenulata, strengthening our understanding into its putitive active ingredient composition, pharmacological activity, and mechanism of action. These findings also provide strong evidence supporting the important medicinal and economical value of R. crenulata. Consequently, some Rhodiola species are becoming endangered because of overexploitation and environmental destruction. However, little is known about the genetic and genomic information of any Rhodiola species. Here we report the first draft assembly ofthe R. crenulata genome, which was 344.5 Mb (25.7 Mb Ns), accounting for 82% of the estimated genome size, with a scaffold N50 length of 144.7 kb and a contig N50 length of 25.4 kb. The R. crenulata genome is not only highly heterozygous but also highly repetitive, with ratios of 1.12% and 66.15%, respectively, based on the k-mer analysis. Furthermore, 226.6 Mb of transposable elements were detected, of which 77.03% were long terminal repeats. In total, 31 517 protein-coding genes were identified, capturing 86.72% of expected plant genes in BUSCO. Additionally, 79.73% of protein-coding genes were functionally annotated. R. crenulata is an important medicinal plant and also a potentially interesting model species for studying the adaptability of Rhodiola species to extreme environments. The genomic sequences of R. crenulata will be useful for understanding the evolutionary mechanism of the stress resistance gene and the biosynthesis pathways of the different medicinal ingredients, for example, salidroside in R. crenulata. © The Author 2017","DNA Transposable Elements; Genome Size; Genome, Plant; Medicine, Tibetan Traditional; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Rhodiola; Sequence Analysis, DNA; salidroside; biosynthesis; evolutionary adaptation; extreme environment; gene identification; gene sequence; genetic code; genome size; genomics; heterozygote; long terminal repeat; male; nonhuman; Note; plant gene; plant genome; plant leaf; priority journal; Rhodiola crenulata; Tibet; transposon; DNA sequence; genetics; molecular genetics; plant genome; procedures; Rhodiola; Tibetan medicine","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027196311"

Data generated from high-throughput experiments increasingly inform these networks, yet current tools do not adequately scale with concomitant increase in their size and complexity. We present an open source software platform, interactome-CAVE (iCAVE), for visualizing large and complex biomolecular interaction networks in 3D. Users can explore networks (i) in 3D using a desktop, (ii) in stereoscopic 3D using 3D-vision glasses and a desktop, or (iii) in immersive 3D within a CAVE environment. iCAVE introduces 3D extensions of known 2D network layout, clustering, and edge-bundling algorithms, as well as new 3D network layout algorithms. Furthermore, users can simultaneously query several built-in databases within iCAVE for network generation or visualize their own networks (e.g., disease, drug, protein, metabolite). iCAVE has modular structure that allows rapid development by addition of algorithms, datasets, or features without affecting other parts of the code. Overall, iCAVE is the first freely available open source tool that enables 3D (optionally stereoscopic or immersive) visualizations of complex, dense, or multi-layered biomolecular networks. While primarily designed for researchers utilizing biomolecular networks, iCAVE can assist researchers in any field. © The Author 2017.

As an herbivore, it can be grown by eco-friendly and resource-conserving aquaculture. However, the large number of intermuscular bones in the trunk musculature is adverse to fish meat processing and consumption. As a first towards optimizing this aquatic livestock, we present a 1.116-Gb draft genome of M. amblycephala, with 779.54 Mb anchored on 24 linkage groups. Integrating spatiotemporal transcriptome analyses, we show that intermuscular bone is formed in the more basal teleosts by intramembranous ossification and may be involved in muscle contractibility and coordinating cellular events. Comparative analysis revealed that olfactory receptor genes, especially of the beta type, underwent an extensive expansion in herbivorous cyprinids, whereas the gene for the umami receptor T1R1 was specifically lost in M. amblycephala. The composition of gut microflora, which contributes to the herbivorous adaptation of M. amblycephala, was found to be similar to that of other herbivores. As a valuable resource for the improvement of M. amblycephala livestock, the draft genome sequence offers new insights into the development of intermuscular bone and herbivorous adaptation. © The Author 2017.

We also visualized the data distribution in SRA by integrating the quality information and metadata of experiments and samples.

The gut microbiota closely interacts with the host immune system, but its functional impact in CD is unclear. Except for studies on a small number of CD patients, analyses of the gut microbiota in CD have used 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Here we employed metagenomic shotgun sequencing to provide a detailed characterization of the compositional and functional features of the CD microbiota, comprising also unannotated bacteria, and investigated its modulation by exclusive enteral nutrition. Based on signature taxa, CD microbiotas clustered into 2 distinct metacommunities, indicating individual variability in CD microbiome structure. Metacommunity-specific functional shifts in CD showed enrichment in producers of the pro-inflammatory hexa-acylated lipopolysaccharide variant and a reduction in the potential to synthesize short-chain fatty acids. Disruption of ecological networks was evident in CD, coupled with reduction in growth rates of many bacterial species. Short-term exclusive enteral nutrition elicited limited impact on the overall composition of the CD microbiota, although functional changes occurred following treatment.

In its final phase, the project released over 85 million genotyped and phased variants on human reference genome assembly GRCh37. An updated reference assembly, GRCh38, was released in late 2013, but there was insufficient time for the final phase of the project analysis to change to the new assembly. Although it is possible to lift the coordinates of the 1000 Genomes Project variants to the new assembly, this is a potentially error-prone process as coordinate remapping is most appropriate only for non-repetitive regions of the genome and those that did not see significant change between the two assemblies. It will also miss variants in any region that was newly added to GRCh38. Thus, to produce the highest quality variants and genotypes on GRCh38, the best strategy is to realign the reads and recall the variants based on the new alignment. As the first step of variant calling for the 1000 Genomes Project data, we have finished remapping all of the 1000 Genomes sequence reads to GRCh38 with alternative scaffold-aware BWA-MEM. The resulting alignments are available as CRAM, a reference-based sequence compression format.

In this study, we searched for SET domain–containing genes (SET genes) in all of the 147 arthropod genomes sequenced at the time of carrying out this experiment to understand the evolutionary history by which SET domains have evolved in insects. Phylogenetic and ancestral state reconstruction analysis revealed an arthropod-specific SET gene family, named SmydA, that is ancestral to arthropod animals and specifically diversified during insect evolution. Considering that pseudogenization is the most probable fate of the new emerging gene copies, we provided experimental and evolutionary evidence to demonstrate their essential functions. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis and in vitro methyltransferase activity assays showed that the SmydA-2 gene was transcriptionally active and retained the original histone methylation activity. Expression knockdown by RNA interference significantly increased mortality, implying that the SmydA genes may be essential for insect survival. We further showed predominantly strong purifying selection on the SmydA gene family and a potential association between the regulation of gene expression and insect phenotypic plasticity by transcriptome analysis. Overall, these data suggest that the SmydA gene family retains essential functions that may possibly define novel regulatory pathways in insects.

The family Haliotidae contains only one genus, Haliotis, and this single genus is known to contain several species of abalone. With 18 additional subspecies, the most comprehensive treatment of Haliotidae considers 56 species valid [ 1 ]. Abalone is an economically important fishery and aquaculture animal that is considered a highly prized seafood delicacy. The total global supply of abalone has increased 5-fold since the 1970s and farm production increased explosively from 50 mt to 103 464 mt in the past 40 years. Additionally, researchers have recently focused on abalone given their reported tumor suppression effect. However, despite the valuable features of this marine animal, no genomic information is available for the Haliotidae family and related research is still limited. To construct the H . discus hannai genome, a total of 580-G base pairs using Illumina and Pacbio platforms were generated with 322-fold coverage based on the 1.8-Gb estimated genome size of H . discus hannai using flow cytometry. The final genome assembly consisted of 1.86 Gb with 35 450 scaffolds (>2 kb). GC content level was 40.51%, and the N50 length of assembled scaffolds was 211 kb. We identified 29 449 genes using Evidence Modeler based on the gene information from ab initio prediction, protein homology with known genes, and transcriptome evidence of RNA-seq. Here we present the first Haliotidae genome, H . discus hannai , with sequencing data, assembly, and gene annotation information. This will be helpful for resolving the lack of genomic information in the Haliotidae family as well as providing more opportunities for understanding gastropod evolution.","Animals; Base Sequence; Gastropoda; Genome; Sequence Analysis, Protein; animal; gastropod; genetics; genome; nucleotide sequence; sequence analysis","","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029657181"

Many questions about the gayal such as its origin, population history, and genetic basis of local adaptation remain largely unresolved. De novo sequencing and assembly of the whole gayal genome provides an opportunity to address these issues. We report a high-depth sequencing, de novo assembly, and annotation of a female Chinese gayal genome. Based on the Illumina genomic sequencing platform, we have generated 350.38 Gb of raw data from 16 different insert-size libraries. A total of 276.86 Gb of clean data is retained after quality control. The assembled genome is about 2.85 Gb with scaffold and contig N50 sizes of 2.74 Mb and 14.41 kb, respectively. Repetitive elements account for 48.13% of the genome. Gene annotation has yielded 26 667 protein-coding genes, of which 97.18% have been functionally annotated. BUSCO assessment shows that our assembly captures 93% (3183 of 4104) of the core eukaryotic genes and 83.1% of vertebrate universal single-copy orthologs. We provide the first comprehensive de novo genome of the gayal. This genetic resource is integral for investigating the origin of the gayal and performing comparative genomic studies to improve understanding of the speciation and divergence of bovine species. The assembled genome could be used as reference in future population genetic studies of gayal. © The Author 2017.","Animals; Cattle; Genome; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Phylogeny; Whole Genome Sequencing; genomic DNA; Article; chromosome; female; gene sequence; gene structure; genome; genome size; karyotype; mithun; nonhuman; phylogeny; prediction; priority journal; quality control; animal; bovine; classification; genetics; molecular genetics; whole genome sequencing","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042172563"

Studies that have examined high-altitude adaptation have identified a vast array of rapidly evolving genes that characterize the dramatic phenotypic changes in high-altitude animals. However, how high-altitude environment shapes gene expression programs remains largely unknown. Findings: We generated a total of 910 Gb of high-quality RNA-seq data for 180 samples derived from 6 tissues of 5 agriculturally important high-altitude vertebrates (Tibetan chicken, Tibetan pig, Tibetan sheep, Tibetan goat, and yak) and their cross-fertile relatives living in geographically neighboring low-altitude regions. Of these, ~75% reads could be aligned to their respective reference genomes, and on average ~60% of annotated protein coding genes in each organism showed FPKM expression values greater than 0.5. We observed a general concordance in topological relationships between the nucleotide alignments and gene expression-based trees. Tissue and species accounted for markedly more variance than altitude based on either the expression or the alternative splicing patterns. Cross-species clustering analyses showed a tissue-dominated pattern of gene expression and a species-dominated pattern for alternative splicing. We also identified numerous differentially expressed genes that could potentially be involved in phenotypic divergence shaped by high-altitude adaptation. Conclusions: These data serve as a valuable resource for examining the convergence and divergence of gene expression changes between species as they adapt or acclimatize to high-altitude environments. © The Author(s) 2017.","Acclimatization; Alternative Splicing; Altitude; Animals; Cattle; Chickens; Gene Expression Profiling; Genome; Goats; Phylogeny; Sheep; Swine; Transcriptome; Whole Genome Sequencing; transcriptome; alternative RNA splicing; altitude acclimatization; controlled study; FPKM gene; gene; gene expression; gene function; genetic variability; nonhuman; Note; phenotypic variation; phylogenetic tree; priority journal; relative; RNA sequence; sequence analysis; transcriptomics; vertebrate; acclimatization; altitude; animal; bovine; chicken; comparative study; gene expression profiling; genetics; genome; goat; phylogeny; pig; sheep; whole genome sequencing","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042348625"

This is significant as the accurate identification of structural variation is still an outstanding but important problem in genomics. The emergence of new sequencing technologies that generate longer sequence reads can, in theory, provide direct evidence for all types of SVs regardless of the length of the region through which it spans. However, current efforts to use these data in this manner require the use of large computational resources to assemble these sequences as well as visual inspection of each region. Here we present VaPoR, a highly efficient algorithm that autonomously validates large SV sets using long-read sequencing data. We assessed the performance of VaPoR on SVs in both simulated and real genomes and report a high-fidelity rate for overall accuracy across different levels of sequence depths. We show that VaPoR can interrogate a much larger range of SVs while still matching existing methods in terms of false positive validations and providing additional features considering breakpoint precision and predicted genotype. We further show that VaPoR can run quickly and efficiency without requiring a large processing or assembly pipeline. VaPoR provides a long read-based validation approach for genomic SVs that requires relatively low read depth and computing resources and thus will provide utility with targeted or low-pass sequencing coverage for accurate SV assessment.

Despite the long introduction history of this species, its profound ecological impacts, and its utility for demonstrating evolutionary principles, genetic information is sparse. Here we produce a de novo transcriptome spanning multiple tissues and life stages to enable investigation of the genetic basis of previously identified rapid phenotypic change over the introduced range. Findings: Using approximately 1.9 billion reads from developing tadpoles and 6 adult tissue-specific cDNA libraries, as well as a transcriptome assembly pipeline encompassing 100 separate de novo assemblies, we constructed 62 202 transcripts, of which we functionally annotated ~50%. Our transcriptome assembly exhibits 90% full-length completeness of the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs data set. Robust assembly metrics and comparisons with several available anuran transcriptomes and genomes indicate that our cane toad assembly is one of the most complete anuran genomic resources available. Conclusions: This comprehensive anuran transcriptome will provide a valuable resource for investigation of genes under selection during invasion in cane toads, but will also greatly expand our general knowledge of anuran genomes, which are underrepresented in the literature. The data set is publically available in NCBI and GigaDB to serve as a resource for other researchers. © The Author(s) 2017.","Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Benchmarking; Bufonidae; Chromosome Mapping; Female; Gene Library; Gene Ontology; Genome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Introduced Species; Life Cycle Stages; Male; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; transcriptome; transcriptome; adult; Amphibia; animal tissue; brain tissue; DNA library; female; gene identification; genome; invasive species; liver tissue; male; muscle tissue; nonhuman; Note; ovary tissue; priority journal; Rhinella marina; RNA sequence; spleen tissue; tadpole; testis tissue; animal; aquatic species; benchmarking; Bufonidae; chromosomal mapping; gene library; gene ontology; genetics; growth, development and aging; high throughput sequencing; introduced species; life cycle stage; molecular genetics; sequence analysis","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044573802"

Such a method would aid Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) enforcement officers to combat wildlife crime by preventing illegal trade of endangered plant and animal species. The objective of this research was to develop a multi-locus DNA metabarcoding method for forensic wildlife species identification and to evaluate the applicability and reproducibility of this approach across different laboratories. A DNA metabarcoding method was developed that makes use of 12 DNA barcode markers that have demonstrated universal applicability across a wide range of plant and animal taxa and that facilitate the identification of species in samples containing degraded DNA. The DNA metabarcoding method was developed based on Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing of well-defined experimental mixtures, for which a bioinformatics pipeline with user-friendly web-interface was developed. The performance of the DNA metabarcoding method was assessed in an international validation trial by 16 laboratories, in which the method was found to be highly reproducible and sensitive enough to identify species present in a mixture at 1% dry weight content. The advanced multi-locus DNA metabarcoding method assessed in this study provides reliable and detailed data on the composition of complex food products, including information on the presence of CITES-listed species. The method can provide improved resolution for species identification, while verifying species with multiple DNA barcodes contributes to an enhanced quality assurance. © The Author 2017.","Animals; Computational Biology; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; DNA, Plant; Endangered Species; Plants; Reproducibility of Results; plant DNA; amplicon; applicability; Article; bioinformatics; DNA barcoding; DNA degradation; DNA sequence; dry weight; endangered species; food composition; gene amplification; information system; measurement precision; multi locus DNA metabarcoding; nonhuman; pilot study; priority journal; quality control; reliability; reproducibility; sensitivity analysis; species identification; validation study; animal; biology; classification; genetics; plant; reproducibility","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031727527"

L. striatellus is different from 2 other rice planthoppers with a released genome sequence, Sogatella furcifera and Nilaparvata lugens, inmany biological characteristics, such as host range, dispersal capacity, and vectoring plant viruses. Deciphering the genome of L. striatellus will further the understanding of the genetic basis of the biological differences among the 3 rice planthoppers. Findings: A total of 190 Gb of Illumina data and 32.4 Gb of Pacbio data were generated and used to assemble a high-quality L. striatellus genome sequence, which is 541 Mb in length and has a contig N50 of 118 Kb and a scaffold N50 of 1.08 Mb. Annotated repetitive elements account for 25.7% of the genome. A total of 17 736 protein-coding genes were annotated, capturing 97.6% and 98% of the BUSCO eukaryote and arthropoda genes, respectively. Compared with N. lugens and S. furcifera, L. striatellus has the smallest genome and the lowest gene number. Gene family expansion and transcriptomic analyses provided hints to the genomic basis of the differences in important traits such as host range, migratory habit, and plant virus transmission between L. striatellus and the other 2 planthoppers. Conclusions: We report a high-quality genome assembly of L. striatellus, which is an important genomic resource not only for the study of the biology of L. striatellus and its interactions with plant hosts and plant viruses, but also for comparison with other planthoppers. © The Author(s) 2017.","Animals; Chromosome Mapping; Gene Expression Profiling; Genome Size; Genome, Insect; Hemiptera; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Oryza; Phylogeny; Quantitative Trait Loci; Whole Genome Sequencing; Article; chromosome number; detoxification; gene function; gene number; gene sequence; genome analysis; genome size; insect genome; Laodelphax striatella; Nilaparvata lugens; nonhuman; priority journal; sequence analysis; smelling; species difference; transcriptomics; virus cell interaction; virus transmission; animal; chromosomal mapping; gene expression profiling; genetics; Hemiptera; molecular genetics; Oryza; parasitology; phylogeny; procedures; quantitative trait locus; whole genome sequencing","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041578784"

Silk produced by A. yamamai, referred to as tensan silk, shows different characteristics such as thickness, compressive elasticity, and chemical resistance compared with common silk produced from the domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori. Its unique characteristics have led to its use in many research fields including biotechnology and medical science, and the scientific as well as economic importance of the wild silk moth continues to gradually increase. However, no genomic information for the wild silk moth, including A. yamamai, is currently available. Findings: In order to construct the A. yamamai genome, a total of 147G base pairs using Illumina and Pacbio sequencing platforms were generated, providing 210-fold coverage based on the 700-Mb estimated genome size of A. yamamai. The assembled genome of A. yamamai was 656 Mb (> 2 kb) with 3675 scaffolds, and the N50 length of assembly was 739 Kb with a 34.07% GC ratio. Identified repeat elements covered 37.33% of the total genome, and the completeness of the constructed genome assembly was estimated to be 96.7% by Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs v2 analysis. A total of 15 481 genes were identified using Evidence Modeler based on the gene prediction results obtained from 3 different methods (ab initio, RNA-seq-based, known-gene-based) and manual curation. Conclusions: Here we present the genome sequence of A. yamamai, the first genome sequence of the wild silk moth. These results provide valuable genomic information, which will help enrich our understanding of the molecular mechanisms relating to not only specific phenotypes such as wild silk itself but also the genomic evolution of Saturniidae. © The Author(s) 2017.","Animals; Benchmarking; Bombyx; Chromosome Mapping; Gene Ontology; Genome Size; Genome, Insect; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Karyotype; Microsatellite Repeats; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Phylogeny; Quercus; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; fibroin; microsatellite DNA; transcriptome; algorithm; Antheraea yamamai; base pairing; Bombyx mori; Drosophila melanogaster; elasticity; exon; gamete; genome analysis; genome size; heterozygosity; insect genome; Japanese oak silk moth; metaphase; moth; multigene family; nonhuman; Note; phenotype; phylogeny; priority journal; RNA sequence; species distribution; whole genome sequencing; animal; benchmarking; Bombyx; chromosomal mapping; classification; gene ontology; genetics; high throughput sequencing; karyotype; molecular genetics; oak; procedures; sequence analysis; statistics and numerical data","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040317549"

Despite this, the majority of SE Asia's genetic diversity is still poorly characterized. The growing interest in using environmental DNA to assess and monitor SE Asian species, in particular threatened mammals-has created the urgent need to expand the available reference database of mitochondrial barcode and complete mitogenome sequences. We have partially addressed this need by generating 72 new mitogenome sequences reconstructed from DNA isolated from a range of historical and modern tissue samples. Approximately 55 gigabases of raw sequence were generated. From this data, we assembled 72 complete mitogenome sequences, with an average depth of coverage of ×102.9 and ×55.2 for modern samples and historical samples, respectively. This dataset represents 52 species, of which 30 species had no previous mitogenome data available. The mitogenomes were geotagged to their sampling location, where known, to display a detailed geographical distribution of the species. Our new database of 52 taxa will strongly enhance the utility of environmental DNA approaches for monitoring mammals in SE Asia as it greatly increases the likelihoods that identification of metabarcoding sequencing reads can be assigned to reference sequences. This magnifies the confidence in species detections and thus allows more robust surveys and monitoring programmes of SE Asia's threatened mammal biodiversity. The extensive collections of historical samples from SE Asia in western and SE Asian museums should serve as additional valuable material to further enrich this reference database. © The Author 2017.

Although genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses have been performed to investigate the pathogenesis of psoriasis, the role of metabolites in psoriasis, particularly of lipids, remains unclear. Lipids not only comprise the bulk of the cellular membrane bilayers but also regulate a variety of biological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, immunity, angiogenesis, and inflammation. In this study, an untargeted lipidomics approach was used to study the lipid profiles in psoriasis and to identify lipid metabolite signatures for psoriasis through ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. Plasma samples from 90 participants (45 healthy and 45 psoriasis patients) were collected and analyzed. Statistical analysis was applied to find different metabolites between the disease and healthy groups. In addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to validate differentially expressed lipids in psoriatic patient plasma. Finally, we identified differential expression of several lipids including lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidic acid (PA); among these metabolites, LPA, LysoPC, and PA were significantly increased, while PC and PI were down-regulated in psoriasis patients. We found that elements of glycerophospholipid metabolism such as LPA, LysoPC, PA, PI, and PC were significantly altered in the plasma of psoriatic patients; this study characterizes the circulating lipids in psoriatic patients and provides novel insight into the role of lipids in psoriasis. © The Author 2017.","Adult; Case-Control Studies; Female; Glycerophospholipids; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psoriasis; glycerophospholipid; lysophosphatidic acid; lysophosphatidylcholine; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylinositol; glycerophospholipid; adult; Article; blood sampling; clinical article; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; lipid analysis; lipidomics; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; phospholipid metabolism; priority journal; psoriasis; validation process; blood; case control study; middle aged; psoriasis","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046283782"

Unlike all other cervids, female reindeer, as well as males, regularly grow cranial appendages (antlers, the defining characteristics of cervids). Moreover, reindeer milk contains more protein and less lactose than bovids' milk. A high-quality reference genome of this species will assist efforts to elucidate these and other important features in the reindeer. Findings: We obtained 615 Gb (Gigabase) of usable sequences by filtering the low-quality reads of the raw data generated from the Illumina Hiseq 4000 platform, and a 2.64-Gb final assembly, representing 95.7% of the estimated genome (2.76 Gb according to k-mer analysis), including 92.6% of expected genes according to BUSCO analysis. The contig N50 and scaffold N50 sizes were 89.7 kilo base (kb) and 0.94 mega base (Mb), respectively. We annotated 21 555 protein-coding genes and 1.07 Gb of repetitive sequences by de novo and homology-based prediction. Homology-based searches detected 159 rRNA, 547 miRNA, 1339 snRNA, and 863 tRNA sequences in the genome of R. tarandus. The divergence time between R. tarandus and ancestors of Bos taurus and Capra hircus is estimated to be about 29.5 million years ago.

Here, we compared the gut microbial composition of 43 GDM patients and 81 healthy pregnant women via whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing of their fecal samples, collected at 21-29 weeks, to explore associations between GDM and the composition of microbial taxonomic units and functional genes. A metagenome-wide association study identified 154 837 genes, which clustered into 129 metagenome linkage groups (MLGs) for species description, with significant relative abundance differences between the 2 cohorts. Parabacteroides distasonis, Klebsiella variicola, etc., were enriched in GDM patients, whereas Methanobrevibacter smithii, Alistipes spp., Bifidobacterium spp., and Eubacterium spp. were enriched in controls. The ratios of the gross abundances of GDM-enriched MLGs to control-enriched MLGs were positively correlated with blood glucose levels. A random forest model shows that fecal MLGs have excellent discriminatory power to predict GDM status.

It has been shown that the vast majority of DNA extracted from ancient samples come from bacteria (presumably modern contaminants). However, characterization of microbial DNA accompanying human remains has never been done systematically for a wide range of different samples. We used metagenomic approaches to perform comparative analyses of microorganism communities present in 161 archaeological human remains. DNA samples were isolated from the teeth of human skeletons dated from 100 AD to 1200 AD. The skeletons were collected from 7 archaeological sites in Central Europe and stored under different conditions. The majority of identified microbes were ubiquitous environmental bacteria that most likely contaminated the host remains not long ago. We observed that the composition of microbial communities was sample-specific and not correlated with its temporal or geographical origin. Additionally, traces of bacteria and archaea typical for human oral/gut flora, as well as potential pathogens, were identified in two-thirds of the samples. The genetic material of human-related species, in contrast to the environmental species that accounted for the majority of identified bacteria, displayed DNA damage patterns comparable with endogenous human ancient DNA, which suggested that these microbes might have accompanied the individual before death. Our study showed that the microbiome observed in an individual sample is not reliant on the method or duration of sample storage. Moreover, shallow sequencing of DNA extracted from ancient specimens and subsequent bioinformatics analysis allowed both the identification of ancient microbial species, including potential pathogens, and their differentiation from contemporary species that colonized human remains more recently. © The Author 2017.

As a workflow-like tool, SOAPnuke centralizes processing functions into 1 executable and predefines their order to avoid the necessity of reformatting different files when switching tools. Furthermore, the MapReduce framework enables large scalability to distribute all the processing works to an entire compute cluster. We conducted a benchmarking where SOAPnuke and other tools are used to preprocess a ~30× NA12878 dataset published by GIAB.

The tetraploid transcriptome was annotated and compared with data from the sub-genome progenitors. Caffeine and sucrose genes were targeted for case analysis. An isoform-level tetraploid coffee bean reference transcriptome with 95 995 distinct transcripts (average 3236 bp) was obtained. A total of 88 715 sequences (92.42%) were annotated with BLASTx against NCBI non-redundant plant proteins, including 34 719 high-quality annotations. Further BLASTn analysis against NCBI non-redundant nucleotide sequences, Coffea canephora coding sequences with UTR, C. arabica ESTs, and Rfam resulted in 1213 sequences without hits, were potential novel genes in coffee. Longer UTRs were captured, especially in the 5'UTRs, facilitating the identification of upstream open reading frames. The LRS also revealed more and longer transcript variants in key caffeine and sucrose metabolism genes from this polyploid genome. Long sequences (>10 kilo base) were poorly annotated. LRS technology shows the limitation of previous studies.

Due to over-hunting and subsistence poaching, as well as competition with livestock and habitat loss, O. ammon has been categorized as an endangered species on several lists. It can have fertile offspring with sheep. Hence, a high-quality reference genome of the Marco Polo Sheep will be very helpful in conservation genetics and even in exploiting useful genes in sheep breeding. Findings: A total of 1022.43 Gb of raw reads resulting from whole-genome sequencing of a Marco Polo Sheep were generated using an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. The final genome assembly (2.71 Gb) has an N50 contig size of 30.7 Kb and a scaffold N50 of 5.49 Mb. The repeat sequences identified account for 46.72% of the genome, and 20 336 protein-coding genes were predicted from the masked genome. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a close relationship between Marco Polo Sheep and the domesticated sheep, and the time of their divergence was approximately 2.36 million years ago. We identified 271 expanded gene families and 168 putative positively selected genes in the Marco Polo Sheep lineage. Conclusions: We provide the first genome sequence and gene annotation for the Marco Polo Sheep. The availability of these resources will be of value in the future conservation of this endangered large mammal, for research into high altitude adaptation mechanisms, for reconstructing the evolutionary history of the Caprinae, and for the future conservation of the Marco Polo Sheep. © The Author(s) 2017.","Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Evolution, Molecular; Genome Size; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Phylogeny; Sheep; Species Specificity; Whole Genome Sequencing; genomic DNA; breeding; conservation genetics; DNA extraction; domestic animal; genetic code; genetic variability; genome analysis; genome size; human; molecular evolution; molecular phylogeny; molecular weight; nonhuman; Note; Ovis ammon polii; priority journal; sheep; whole genome sequencing; animal; environmental protection; genetics; high throughput sequencing; molecular genetics; phylogeny; procedures; sheep; species difference","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042391009"

However, the focus of previous studies has primarily been on low-coverage data due to the high cost of sequencing. Although the 1000 Genomes Project and the Haplotype Reference Consortium have both provided powerful reference panels for imputation, low-frequency and novel variants remain difficult to discover and call with accuracy on the basis of low-coverage data. Deep sequencing provides an optimal solution for the problem of these low-frequency and novel variants. Although whole-exome sequencing is also a viable choice for exome regions, it cannot account for noncoding regions, sometimes resulting in the absence of important, causal variants. For Han Chinese populations, the majority of variants have been discovered based upon low-coverage data from the 1000 Genomes Project. However, high-coverage, whole-genome sequencing data are limited for any population, and a large amount of low-frequency, population-specific variants remain uncharacterized. We have performed whole-genome sequencing at a high depth (~×80) of 90 unrelated individuals of Chinese ancestry, collected from the 1000 Genomes Project samples, including 45 Northern Han Chinese and 45 Southern Han Chinese samples. Eighty-three of these 90 have been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project. We have identified 12 568 804 single nucleotide polymorphisms, 2 074 210 short InDels, and 26 142 structural variations from these 90 samples. Compared to the Han Chinese data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we have found 7 000 629 novel variants with low frequency (defined as minor allele frequency < 5%), including 5 813 503 single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 169 199 InDels, and 17 927 structural variants. Using deep sequencing data, we have built a greatly expanded spectrum of genetic variation for the Han Chinese genome. Compared to the 1000 Genomes Project, these Han Chinese deep sequencing data enhance the characterization of a large number of low-frequency, novel variants. This will be a valuable resource for promoting Chinese genetics research and medical development. Additionally, it will provide a valuable supplement to the 1000 Genomes Project, as well as to other human genome projects. © The Author 2017.","Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Gene Frequency; Genome, Human; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; INDEL Mutation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Whole Genome Sequencing; Article; controlled study; gene frequency; genetic variability; genome analysis; genotype; Han Chinese; human; human cell; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; whole genome sequencing; Asian continental ancestry group; genetics; high throughput sequencing; human genome; indel mutation; procedures; whole genome sequencing","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031817730"

The root microbial community structure has been extensively investigated by 16S/18S/ITS amplicons and metagenomic sequencing in crops and model plants. However, the functional associations between root microbes and host plant growth are poorly understood. This work investigates the root bacterial community of foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and its potential effects on host plant productivity. We determined the bacterial composition of 2882 samples from foxtail millet rhizoplane, rhizosphere and corresponding bulk soils from 2 well-separated geographic locations by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We identified 16 109 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and defined 187 OTUs as shared rhizoplane core OTUs. The β-diversity analysis revealed that microhabitat was the major factor shaping foxtail millet root bacterial community, followed by geographic locations. Large-scale association analysis identified the potential beneficial bacteria correlated with plant high productivity. Besides, the functional prediction revealed specific pathways enriched in foxtail millet rhizoplane bacterial community. We systematically described the root bacterial community structure of foxtail millet and found its core rhizoplane bacterial members. Our results demonstrated that host plants enrich specific bacteria and functions in the rhizoplane. The potentially beneficial bacteria may serve as a valuable knowledge foundation for bio-fertilizer development in agriculture. © The Author 2017.","Bacteria; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; Genome, Bacterial; Microbiota; Millets; Rhizome; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; RNA 16S; RNA 16S; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Article; Bacteroidetes; community structure; Firmicutes; foxtail millet; geographic distribution; microbial community; microbiome; microhabitat; nonhuman; plant growth; plant root; priority journal; Proteobacteria; rhizosphere; sequence analysis; soil analysis; taxonomy; bacterial genome; bacterium; classification; DNA barcoding; genetics; microbiology; microflora; millet; rhizome","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040089640"

Longan is an edible drupe fruit and a source of traditional medicine with polyphenol-rich traits. Tree size, alternate bearing, and witches' broom disease still pose serious problems. To gain insights into the genomic basis of longan traits, a draft genome sequence was assembled. The draft genome (about 471.88 Mb) of a Chinese longan cultivar, ""Honghezi,"" was estimated to contain 31 007 genes and 261.88 Mb of repetitive sequences. No recent whole-genome-wide duplication event was detected in the genome. Whole-genome resequencing and analysis of 13 cultivated D. longan accessions revealed the extent of genetic diversity. Comparative transcriptome studies combined with genome-wide analysis revealed polyphenol-rich and pathogen resistance characteristics. Genes involved in secondary metabolism, especially those from significantly expanded (DHS, SDH, F3΄H, ANR, and UFGT) and contracted (PAL, CHS, and F3΄5΄H) gene families with tissue-specific expression, may be important contributors to the high accumulation levels of polyphenolic compounds observed in longan fruit. The high number of genes encoding nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) and leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase proteins, as well as the recent expansion and contraction of the NBS-LRR family, suggested a genomic basis for resistance to insects, fungus, and bacteria in this fruit tree. These data provide insights into the evolution and diversity of the longan genome. The comparative genomic and transcriptome analyses provided information about longan-specific traits, particularly genes involved in its polyphenol-rich and pathogen resistance characteristics. © The Author 2017.

A key resource for these studies is a high-quality reference genome assembly; however, as with most mammalian genomes, the current iteration of the chimpanzee reference genome assembly is highly fragmented. In the current iteration of the chimpanzee reference genome assembly (Pan tro 2.1.4), the sequence is scattered across more then 183 000 contigs, incorporating more than 159 000 gaps, with a genome-wide contig N50 of 51 Kbp. In this work, we produce an extensive and diverse array of sequencing datasets to rapidly assemble a new chimpanzee reference that surpasses previous iterations in bases represented and organized in large scaffolds. To this end, we show substantial improvements over the current release of the chimpanzee genome (Pan tro 2.1.4) by several metrics, such as increased contiguity by >750% and 300% on contigs and scaffolds, respectively, and closure of 77% of gaps in the Pan tro 2.1.4 assembly gaps spanning >850 Kbp of the novel coding sequence based on RNASeq data. We further report more than 2700 genes that had putatively erroneous frame-shift predictions to human in Pan tro 2.1.4 and show a substantial increase in the annotation of repetitive elements. We apply a simple 3-way hybrid approach to considerably improve the reference genome assembly for the chimpanzee, providing a valuable resource for the study of human origins. Furthermore, we produce extensive sequencing datasets that are all derived from the same cell line, generating a broad non-human benchmark dataset. © The Author 2017.","Animals; Contig Mapping; Genome; Genomics; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Pan troglodytes; Reference Standards; Whole Genome Sequencing; Article; chimpanzee; contig mapping; frameshift mutation; genome; genome analysis; genome size; nonhuman; priority journal; reference genome; RNA sequence; sequence analysis; sequence database; animal; genetics; genomics; molecular genetics; Pan troglodytes; procedures; standard; standards; whole genome sequencing","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042192550"

To quantify such traits from images of root systems, researchers often have to choose between automated tools (that are prone to error and extract only a limited number of architectural traits) or semi-automated ones (that are highly time consuming). We trained a Random Forest algorithm to infer architectural traits from automatically extracted image descriptors. The training was performed on a subset of the dataset, then applied to its entirety. This strategy allowed us to (i) decrease the image analysis time by 73% and (ii) extract meaningful architectural traits based on image descriptors. We also show that these traits are sufficient to identify the quantitative trait loci that had previously been discovered using a semi-automated method. We have shown that combining semi-automated image analysis with machine learning algorithms has the power to increase the throughput of large-scale root studies. We expect that such an approach will enable the quantification of more complex root systems for genetic studies.

As such, there exist multiple methods to extract knowledge from biological networks. However, these approaches usually limit their scope to a single biological entity type of interest or they lack the flexibility to analyze user-defined data. Results: We developed ProphTools, a flexible open-source command-line tool that performs prioritization on a heterogeneous network. ProphTools prioritization combines a Flow Propagation algorithm similar to a Random Walk with Restarts and a weighted propagation method. A flexible model for the representation of a heterogeneous network allows the user to define a prioritization problem involving an arbitrary number of entity types and their interconnections. Furthermore, ProphTools provides functionality to perform cross-validation tests, allowing users to select the best network configuration for a given problem. ProphTools core prioritization methodology has already been proven effective in gene-disease prioritization and drug repositioning. Here we make ProphTools available to the scientific community as flexible, open-source software and perform a new proof-of-concept case study on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to disease prioritization. Conclusions: ProphTools is robust prioritization software that provides the flexibility not present in other state-of-the-art network analysis approaches, enabling researchers to perform prioritization tasks on any user-defined heterogeneous network. Furthermore, the application to lncRNA-disease prioritization shows that ProphTools can reach the performance levels of ad hoc prioritization tools without losing its generality. © The Author(s) 2017.","Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; RNA, Long Noncoding; Software; long untranslated RNA; algorithm; data analysis software; disease association; disease ontology; exon; gene sequence; genetic code; human genome; malignant neoplasm; Note; priority journal; reproducibility; scoring system; biology; gene regulatory network; genetic database; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; procedures; software","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042359666"

Although the principal synaptic and circuit mechanisms of EDP are increasingly well studied experimentally and computationally, its molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive. EDP can be readily studied in the rodent barrel cortex, where each ""barrel column"" preferentially represents deflections of its own principal whisker. Depriving select whiskers while sparing their neighbours introduces competition between barrel columns, ultimately leading to weakening of intracortical, translaminar (i.e., cortical layer (L)4-to-L2/3) feed-forward excitatory projections in the deprived columns. The same synapses are potentiated in the neighbouring spared columns. These experience-dependent alterations of synaptic strength are thought to underlie somatosensory map plasticity. We used RNA sequencing in this model system to uncover cortical-column and -layer specific changes on the transcriptome level that are induced by altered sensory experience. Column- and layer-specific barrel cortical tissues were collected from juvenile mice with all whiskers intact and mice that received 11-12 days of long whisker (C-row) deprivation before high-quality RNA was purified and sequenced. The current dataset entails an average of 50 million paired-end reads per sample, 75 base pairs in length. On average, 90.15% of reads could be uniquely mapped to the mm10 reference mouse genome. The current data reveal the transcriptional changes in gene expression in the barrel cortex upon altered sensory experience in juvenile mice and will help to molecularly map the mechanisms of cortical plasticity. © The Author 2017.","Animals; Female; Gene Expression; Mice; Sensory Deprivation; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Somatosensory Cortex; Vibrissae; molecular marker; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; cortex layer II; cortex layer III; cortex layer IV; experience dependent plasticity; female; gene expression; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; primary somatosensory cortex; priority journal; RNA sequence; sensory deprivation; transcriptomics; vibrissa; animal; gene expression; physiology; sensory deprivation; sequence analysis; somatosensory cortex","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032856956"

Previously, studies of birds, bats, and insects have detected molecular signatures of differing selection regimes in energy-related genes associated with flight evolution and/or loss. Here, using DNA sequences from more than 1000 nuclear and mitochondrial protein-coding genes obtained from insect transcriptomes, we conduct a broader exploration of which gene categories display positive and relaxed selection at the origin of flight as well as with multiple independent losses of flight. We detected a number of categories of nuclear genes more often under positive selection in the lineage leading to the winged insects (Pterygota), related to catabolic processes such as proteases, as well as splicing-related genes. Flight loss was associated with relaxed selection signatures in splicing genes, mirroring the results for flight evolution. Similar to previous studies of flight loss in various animal taxa, we observed consistently higher nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution ratios in mitochondrial genes of flightless lineages, indicative of relaxed selection in energy-related genes. While oxidative phosphorylation genes were not detected as being under selection with the origin of flight specifically, they were most often detected as being under positive selection in holometabolous (complete metamorphosis) insects as compared with other insect lineages. This study supports some convergence in gene-specific selection pressures associated with flight ability, and the exploratory analysis provided some new insights into gene categories potentially associated with the gain and loss of flight in insects. © The Author 2017.","Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Flight, Animal; Genes, Insect; Genes, Mitochondrial; Insecta; Transcriptome; proteinase; transcriptome; transcriptome; Article; catabolism; DNA sequence; flight; genetic selection; Holometabola; insect; mitochondrial gene; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; priority journal; RNA splicing; winged insect; animal; flying; gene; genetics; insect; molecular evolution; physiology","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032856718"

Practical and robust implementation of complex analytical workflows (where such tools are structured into ""best practices"" for automated analysis of next-generation sequencing datasets) still requires significant programming investment and expertise. Results: We present Kronos, a software platform for facilitating the development and execution of modular, auditable, and distributable bioinformatics workflows. Kronos obviates the need for explicit coding of workflows by compiling a text configuration file into executable Python applications. Making analysis modules would still require programming. The framework of each workflow includes a run manager to execute the encoded workflows locally (or on a cluster or cloud), parallelize tasks, and log all runtime events. The resulting workflows are highly modular and configurable by construction, facilitating flexible and extensible meta-applications that can be modified easily through configuration file editing. The workflows are fully encoded for ease of distribution and can be instantiated on external systems, a step toward reproducible research and comparative analyses. We introduce a framework for building Kronos components that function as shareable, modular nodes in Kronos workflows. Conclusions: The Kronos platform provides a standard framework for developers to implement custom tools, reuse existing tools, and contribute to the community at large.

It has become very popular in China for its wide use in traditional Chinese medicine. In order to improve the aquaculture yield of this valuable fish species, we are trying to develop genomic resources for assistant selection in genetic breeding. Here, we provide whole genome sequencing, assembly, and gene annotation of the lined seahorse, which can enrich genome resource and further application for its molecular breeding. Findings: A total of 174.6 Gb (Gigabase) raw DNA sequences were generated by the Illumina Hiseq2500 platform. The final assembly of the lined seahorse genome is around 458 Mb, representing 94% of the estimated genome size (489 Mb by k-mer analysis). The contig N50 and scaffold N50 reached 14.57 kb and 1.97 Mb, respectively. Quality of the assembled genome was assessed by BUSCO with prediction of 85% of the known vertebrate genes and evaluated using the de novo assembled RNA-seq transcripts to prove a high mapping ratio (more than 99% transcripts could be mapped to the assembly). Using homology-based, de novo and transcriptome-based prediction methods, we predicted 20 788 protein-coding genes in the generated assembly, which is less than our previously reported gene number (23 458) of the tiger tail seahorse (H. comes). Conclusion: We report a draft genome of the lined seahorse. These generated genomic data are going to enrich genome resource of this economically important fish, and also provide insights into the genetic mechanisms of its iconic morphology and male pregnancy behavior. © The Author 2017.

In this study, we used transcriptome sequencing of 5 visceral organs during fasting as well as 24 hours and 48 hours after ingestion of a large meal to unravel the postprandial changes in Burmese pythons. We first used the pooled data to perform a de novo assembly of the transcriptome and supplemented this with a proteomic survey of enzymes in the plasma and gastric fluid. We constructed a high-quality transcriptome with 34 423 transcripts, of which 19 713 (57%) were annotated. Among highly expressed genes (fragments per kilo base per million sequenced reads > 100 in 1 tissue), we found that the transition from fasting to digestion was associated with differential expression of 43 genes in the heart, 206 genes in the liver, 114 genes in the stomach, 89 genes in the pancreas, and 158 genes in the intestine. We interrogated the function of these genes to test previous hypotheses on the response to feeding. We also used the transcriptome to identify 314 secreted proteins in the gastric fluid of the python. Digestion was associated with an upregulation of genes related to metabolic processes, and translational changes therefore appear to support the postprandial rise in metabolism.

Population genomic variations through diversifying selection have not been fully investigated. Findings: The whole genomes of 78 domestic chickens were sequenced to an average of 18-fold coverage for each bird. By combining this data with publicly available genomes of five wild red jungle fowls and eight Xishuangbanna game fowls, we conducted a comprehensive comparative genomics analysis of 91 chickens from 17 populations. After aligning ∼21.30 gigabases (Gb) of high-quality data from each individual to the reference chicken genome, we identified ∼6.44 million (M) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for each population. These SNPs included 1.10 M novel SNPs in 17 populations that were absent in the current chicken dbSNP (Build 145) entries. Conclusions: The current data is important for population genetics and further studies in chickens and will serve as a valuable resource for investigating diversifying selection and candidate genes for selective breeding in chickens. © The Author 2017.","Animals; Chickens; Evolution, Molecular; Galliformes; Genetics, Population; Genome; Genomics; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; animal behavior; Article; body composition; chicken; comparative study; domestic animal; egg production; fowl; gene deletion; gene insertion; genetic variability; genetic variation; genome; genomics; nonhuman; phenotype; population genetics; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; skin color; whole genome sequencing; animal; DNA sequence; Galliformes; genetic selection; genetics; genome; genomics; molecular evolution; phylogeny; population genetics; procedures; sequence alignment","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027181265"

To date, 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies have largely utilised different extraction and amplification methodologies to target the microbial communities of a limited number of sponge species, severely limiting comparative analyses of sponge microbial diversity and structure. Here, we provide an extensive and standardised dataset that will facilitate sponge microbiome comparisons across large spatial, temporal, and environmental scales. Samples from marine sponges (n = 3569 specimens), seawater (n = 370), marine sediments (n = 65) and other environments (n = 29) were collected from different locations across the globe. This dataset incorporates at least 268 different sponge species, including several yet unidentified taxa. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced from extracted DNA using standardised procedures. Raw sequences (total of 1.1 billion sequences) were processed and clustered with (i) a standard protocol using QIIME closed-reference picking resulting in 39 543 operational taxonomic units (OTU) at 97% sequence identity, (ii) a de novo clustering using Mothur resulting in 518 246 OTUs, and (iii) a new high-resolution Deblur protocol resulting in 83 908 unique bacterial sequences. Abundance tables, representative sequences, taxonomic classifications, and metadata are provided. This dataset represents a comprehensive resource of sponge-associated microbial communities based on 16S rRNA gene sequences that can be used to address overarching hypotheses regarding host-associated prokaryotes, including host specificity, convergent evolution, environmental drivers of microbiome structure, and the sponge-associated rare biosphere. © The Author 2017.","Animals; Microbiota; Porifera; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; RNA 16S; RNA 16S; Article; bacterial genetics; biosphere; convergent evolution; data analysis; gene amplification; gene sequence; host range; marine species; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbiome; nonhuman; priority journal; sponge (Porifera); symbiosis; taxonomy; animal; DNA sequence; genetics; microbiology; microflora; sponge (Porifera)","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032859128"

Goniopora columna, Galaxea astreata, and Galaxea acrhelia are scleractinian corals of the Indo-Pacific, representing a diversity of morphologies and life-history traits. G. columna and G. astreata are common and cosmopolitan, while G. acrhelia is largely restricted to the coral triangle and Great Barrier Reef. Reference transcriptomes for these species were assembled from replicate colony fragments exposed to elevated (31°C) and ambient (27°C) temperatures. Trinity was used to create de novo assemblies for each species from 92-102 million raw Illumina Hiseq 2 × 150 bp reads. Host-specific assemblies contained 65 460-72 405 contigs, representing 26 693-37 894 isogroups (~genes) with an average N50 of 2254. Gene name and/or gene ontology annotations were possible for 58% of isogroups on average. Transcriptomes contained 93.1-94.3% of EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups comprising the core eukaryotic gene set, and 89.98-91.92% of the single-copy metazoan core gene set orthologs were complete, indicating fairly comprehensive assemblies.

Here, we present HOMINID, a computational approach based on Lasso linear regression, that given host genetic variation and microbiome taxonomic composition data, identifies host single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are correlated with microbial taxa abundances. Using simulated data, we show that HOMINID has accuracy in identifying associated SNPs and performs better compared with existing methods. We also show that HOMINID can accurately identify the microbial taxa that are correlated with associated SNPs. Lastly, by using HOMINID on real data of human genetic variation and microbiome composition, we identified 13 human SNPs in which genetic variation is correlated with microbiome taxonomic composition across body sites. In conclusion, HOMINID is a powerful method to detect host genetic variants linked to microbiome composition and can facilitate discovery of mechanisms controlling host-microbiome interactions. © The Author(s) 2017.","Animals; Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Computational Biology; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Linear Models; Microbiota; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Article; data analysis; genetic code; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; genotype; host; linear regression analysis; microbiome; nonhuman; population abundance; predictive value; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; single nucleotide polymorphism; species composition; animal; bacterial phenomena and functions; bacterium; biology; classification; host pathogen interaction; human; microflora; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; statistical model","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042377958"

Despite the high potential value of these publicly available data for a broad variety of investigations, little attention has been given to the analytical methodology necessary for their widespread utilisation. Findings: We here present a first principled treatment of the analysis of collections of genomic tracks. We have developed novel computational and statistical methodology to permit comparative and confirmatory analyses across multiple and disparate data sources. We delineate a set of generic questions that are useful across a broad range of investigations and discuss the implications of choosing different statistical measures and null models. Examples include contrasting analyses across different tissues or diseases. The methodology has been implemented in a comprehensive open-source software system, the GSuite HyperBrowser. To make the functionality accessible to biologists, and to facilitate reproducible analysis, we have also developed a web-based interface providing an expertly guided and customizable way of utilizing the methodology. With this system, many novel biological questions can flexibly be posed and rapidly answered.

Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was applied to detect the global lipidome in the fasting plasma of 293 Chinese individuals, including 114 T2D patients, 81 prediabetic subjects, and 98 individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Both qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed a gradual change in plasma lipid features with T2D patients exhibiting characteristics close to those of prediabetic individuals, whereas they differed significantly from individuals with NGT. We constructed and validated a random forest classifier with 28 lipidomic features that effectively discriminated T2D from NGT or prediabetes. Most of the selected features significantly correlated with diabetic clinical indices. Hydroxybutyrylcarnitine was positively correlated with fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour postprandial glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR). Lysophosphatidylcholines such as lysophosphatidylcholine (18:0), lysophosphatidylcholine (18:1), and lysophosphatidylcholine (18:2) were all negatively correlated with HOMA-IR. The altered plasma lipidome in Chinese T2D and prediabetic subjects suggests that lipid features may play a role in the pathogenesis of T2D and that such features may provide a basis for evaluating risk and monitoring disease development. © The Author 2017.

Development of low-cost genotyping and sequencing has made collecting large-scale genotyping data routine in population and therapeutic intervention studies. In addition, a range of new technologies is being used to capture numerous new and complex phenotypic descriptors. As a result, genotype and phenotype datasets have grown exponentially. Genome-wide association studies associate genotypes and phenotypes using methods such as logistic regression. As existing tools for association analysis limit the efficiency by which value can be extracted from increasing volumes of data, there is a pressing need for new software tools that can accelerate association analyses on large genotype-phenotype datasets. Results: Using open innovation (OI) and contest-based crowdsourcing, the logistic regression analysis in a leading, community-standard genetics software package (PLINK 1.07) was substantially accelerated. OI allowed us to do this in <6 months by providing rapid access to highly skilled programmers with specialized, difficult-to-find skill sets. Through a crowd-based contest a combination of computational, numeric, and algorithmic approaches was identified that accelerated the logistic regression in PLINK 1.07 by 18- to 45-fold. Combining contest-derived logistic regression code with coarse-grained parallelization, multithreading, and associated changes to data initialization code further developed through distributed innovation, we achieved an end-to-end speedup of 591-fold for a data set size of 6678 subjects by 645 863 variants, compared to PLINK 1.07's logistic regression. This represents a reduction in run time from 4.8 hours to 29 seconds. Accelerated logistic regression code developed in this project has been incorporated into the PLINK2 project. Conclusions: Using iterative competition-based OI, we have developed a new, faster implementation of logistic regression for genome-wide association studies analysis. We present lessons learned and recommendations on running a successful OI process for bioinformatics. © The Author 2017.

Although analytical cost for standard DNA barcoding has been significantly reduced since early 2000, further dramatic reduction in barcoding costs is unlikely because Sanger sequencing is approaching its limits in throughput and chemistry cost. Constraints in barcoding cost not only led to unbalanced barcoding efforts around the globe, but also prevented high-throughput sequencing (HTS)-based taxonomic identification from applying binomial species names, which provide crucial linkages to biological knowledge. We developed an Illumina-based pipeline, HIFI-Barcode, to produce full-length Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcodes from pooled polymerase chain reaction amplicons generated by individual specimens. The new pipeline generated accurate barcode sequences that were comparable to Sanger standards, even for different haplotypes of the same species that were only a few nucleotides different from each other. Additionally, the new pipeline was much more sensitive in recovering amplicons at low quantity. The HIFI-Barcode pipeline successfully recovered barcodes from more than 78% of the polymerase chain reactions that didn't show clear bands on the electrophoresis gel. Moreover, sequencing results based on the single molecular sequencing platform Pacbio confirmed the accuracy of the HIFI-Barcode results. Altogether, the new pipeline can provide an improved solution to produce full-length reference barcodes at about one-tenth of the current cost, enabling construction of comprehensive barcode libraries for local fauna, leading to a feasible direction for DNA barcoding global biomes. © The Author(s) 2017.","Animals; Biodiversity; Classification; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Insecta; Phylogeny; cytochrome c oxidase; cytochrome c oxidase subunit I; unclassified drug; accuracy; amplicon; DNA barcoding; DNA sequence; fungus; gel electrophoresis; gene amplification; gene sequence; haplotype; heteroplasmy; high throughput sequencing; nonhuman; Note; phylogenetic tree; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; Sanger sequencing; Wolbachia; animal; biodiversity; classification; genetics; insect; phylogeny; procedures","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042354314"

In the traditional Chinese medicine, Erigeron breviscapus, which is native to China, was widely used in the treatment of cerebrovascular disease. A handful of bioactive compounds, including scutellarin, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, and 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid, have been isolated from the plant. With the purpose of finding novel medicinal compounds and understanding their biosynthetic pathways, we propose to sequence the genome of E. breviscapus. Findings: We assembled the highly heterozygous E. breviscapus genome using a combination of PacBio single-molecular real-time sequencing and next-generation sequencing methods on the Illumina HiSeq platform. The final draft genome is approximately 1.2 Gb, with contig and scaffold N50 sizes of 18.8 kb and 31.5 kb, respectively. Further analyses predicted 37 504 protein-coding genes in the E. breviscapus genome and 8172 shared gene families among Compositae species.

Predicting how water quality will respond to global changes not only requires water quality data, but also information about the ecological context of individual water bodies across broad spatial extents. Because lake water quality is usually sampled in limited geographic regions, often for limited time periods, assessing the environmental controls of water quality requires compilation of many data sets across broad regions and across time into an integrated database. LAGOS-NE accomplishes this goal for lakes in the northeastern-most 17 US states. LAGOS-NE contains data for 51 101 lakes and reservoirs larger than 4 ha in 17 lake-rich US states. The database includes 3 data modules for: lake location and physical characteristics for all lakes; ecological context (i.e., the land use, geologic, climatic, and hydrologic setting of lakes) for all lakes; and in situ measurements of lake water quality for a subset of the lakes from the past 3 decades for approximately 2600-12 000 lakes depending on the variable. The database contains approximately 150 000 measures of total phosphorus, 200 000 measures of chlorophyll, and 900 000 measures of Secchi depth. The water quality data were compiled from 87 lake water quality data sets from federal, state, tribal, and non-profit agencies, university researchers, and citizen scientists.

With the rising world population, feeding people in a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way becomes increasingly important. Therefore, the rice research community needs to share resources to better understand the functions of rice genes that are the foundation for future agricultural biotechnology development, and one way to achieve this goal is via the extensive study of insertional mutants. We have constructed a large rice insertional mutant population in a japonica rice variety, Tainung 67. The collection contains about 93 000 mutant lines, among them 85% with phenomics data and 65% with flanking sequence data. We screened the phenotypes of 12 individual plants for each line grown under field conditions according to 68 subcategories and 3 quantitative traits. Both phenotypes and integration sites are searchable in the Taiwan Rice Insertional Mutants Database. Detailed analyses of phenomics data, T-DNA flanking sequences, and whole-genome sequencing data for rice insertional mutants can lead to the discovery of novel genes. In addition, studies of mutant phenotypes can reveal relationships among varieties, cultivation locations, and cropping seasons. © The Author 2017.","Databases, Genetic; DNA, Bacterial; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Variation; Genome, Plant; Genomics; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Mutation; Oryza; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Plants, Genetically Modified; Quality Control; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Reproducibility of Results; DNA; T DNA; unclassified drug; bacterial DNA; T-DNA; Article; controlled study; DNA flanking region; gene activation; gene expression regulation; gene function; gene identification; gene mutation; genetic analysis; genetically modified food; germination; mutant; nonhuman; phenotype; plant biotechnology; plant breeding; population genetics; priority journal; quantitative trait; rice; whole genome sequencing; gene expression regulation; genetic association study; genetic database; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; mutation; Oryza; phenotype; plant genome; procedures; quality control; reproducibility; transgenic plant","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042145701"

Its distribution in southwest China covers several different habitats and environments. However, not much research had been conducted on Rhododendron spp. at the molecular level, which hinders understanding of its evolution, speciation, and synthesis of secondary metabolites, as well as its wide adaptability to different environments. Here, we report the genome assembly and gene annotation of R. delavayi var. delavayi (the second genome sequenced in the Ericaceae), which will facilitate the study of the family. The genome assembly will have further applications in genome-assisted cultivar breeding. The final size of the assembled R. delavayi var. delavayi genome (695.09 Mb) was close to the 697.94 Mb, estimated by k-mer analysis. A total of 336.83 gigabases (Gb) of raw Illumina HiSeq 2000 reads were generated from 9 libraries (with insert sizes ranging from 170 bp to 40 kb), achieving a raw sequencing depth of ×482.6. After quality filtering, 246.06 Gb of clean reads were obtained, giving ×352.55 coverage depth. Assembly using Platanus gave a total scaffold length of 695.09 Mb, with a contig N50 of 61.8 kb and a scaffold N50 of 637.83 kb. Gene prediction resulted in the annotation of 32 938 protein-coding genes. The genome completeness was evaluated by CEGMA and BUSCO and reached 95.97% and 92.8%, respectively. The gene annotation completeness was also evaluated by CEGMA and BUSCO and reached 97.01% and 87.4%, respectively. Genome annotation revealed that 51.77% of the R. delavayi genome is composed of transposable elements, and 37.48% of long terminal repeat elements (LTRs). The de novo assembled genome of R. delavayi var. delavayi (hereinafter referred to as R. delavayi) is the second genomic resource of the family Ericaceae and will provide a valuable resource for research on future comparative genomic studies in Rhododendron species. The availability of the R. delavayi genome sequence will hopefully provide a tool for scientists to tackle open questions regarding molecular mechanisms underlying environmental interactions in the genus Rhododendron, more accurately understand the evolutionary processes and systematics of the genus, facilitate the identification of genes encoding pharmaceutically important compounds, and accelerate molecular breeding to release elite varieties. © The Author 2017.","China; Genome, Plant; Phylogeny; Rhododendron; genomic DNA; Article; breeding method; contig mapping; controlled study; cultivar; environmental factor; Ericaceae; gene identification; genome analysis; genome size; long terminal repeat; molecular breeding; molecular genetics; molecular phylogeny; nonhuman; plant breeding; plant genetics; plant tissue; priority journal; Rhododendron; Rhododendron delavayi; sequence analysis; species comparison; transcriptomics; transposon; China; genetics; phylogeny; plant genome; Rhododendron","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032857635"

While transcriptome studies have been performed previously with various camptothecin-producing species, no genome sequence for a camptothecin-producing species is available to date. We generated a high-quality de novo genome assembly for C. acuminata representing 403 174 860 bp on 1394 scaffolds with an N50 scaffold size of 1752 kbp. Quality assessments of the assembly revealed robust representation of the genome sequence including genic regions. Using a novel genome annotation method, we annotated 31 825 genes encoding 40 332 gene models. Based on sequence identity and orthology with validated genes from Catharanthus roseus as well as Pfam searches, we identified candidate orthologs for genes potentially involved in camptothecin biosynthesis. Extensive gene duplication including tandem duplication was widespread in the C. acuminata genome, with 2571 genes belonging to 997 tandem duplicated gene clusters. To our knowledge, this is the first genome sequence for a camptothecin-producing species, and access to the C. acuminata genome will permit not only discovery of genes encoding the camptothecin biosynthetic pathway but also reagents that can be used for heterologous expression of camptothecin and camptothecin analogs with novel pharmaceutical applications. © The Author 2017.","Antineoplastic Agents; Camptotheca; Camptothecin; Contig Mapping; Gene Duplication; Genome, Plant; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Plant Proteins; Tandem Repeat Sequences; Whole Genome Sequencing; antineoplastic agent; camptothecin; DNA topoisomerase; camptothecin; plant protein; antineoplastic activity; Article; biosynthesis; Camptotheca; Camptotheca acuminata; Catharanthus roseus; drug structure; enzyme inhibition; gene duplication; gene sequence; nonhuman; orthology; plant gene; plant genome; priority journal; Camptotheca; chemistry; classification; contig mapping; genetics; metabolism; molecular genetics; tandem repeat; whole genome sequencing","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031775520"

We have developed fastBMA, a distributed, parallel, and scalable implementation of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) for this purpose. fastBMA also includes a computationally efficient module for eliminating redundant indirect edges in the network by mapping the transitive reduction to an easily solved shortest-path problem. We evaluated the performance of fastBMA on synthetic data and experimental genome-wide time series yeast and human datasets. When using a single CPU core, fastBMA is up to 100 times faster than the next fastest method, LASSO, with increased accuracy. It is a memory-efficient, parallel, and distributed application that scales to human genome-wide expression data. A 10 000-gene regulation network can be obtained in a matter of hours using a 32-core cloud cluster (2 nodes of 16 cores). fastBMA is a significant improvement over its predecessor ScanBMA. It is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster than other fast network inference methods such as the 1 based on LASSO. The improved scalability allows it to calculate networks from genome scale data in a reasonable time frame. The transitive reduction method can improve accuracy in denser networks. fastBMA is available as code (M.I.T. license) from GitHub (https://github.com/lhhunghimself/fastBMA), as part of the updated networkBMA Bioconductor package (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/networkBMA.html) and as ready-to-deploy Docker images (https://hub.docker.com/r/biodepot/fastbma/). © The Author 2017.","Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Gene Expression; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genome, Fungal; Genome, Human; Humans; Models, Statistical; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Article; Bayes theorem; fastBMA; gene regulatory network; genetic algorithm; genetic database; mathematical model; methodology; molecular docking; priority journal; probability; regression analysis; algorithm; Bayes theorem; fungal genome; gene expression; human; human genome; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; statistical model","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032853670"

In this study, we tested the ability of the MinIONTM platform to perform long amplicon sequencing in order to design new approaches to study microbial diversity using a multi-locus approach. After compiling a robust database by parsing and extracting the rrn bacterial region from more than 67 000 complete or draft bacterial genomes, we demonstrated that the data obtained during sequencing of the long amplicon in the MinIONTM device using R9 and R9.4 chemistries were sufficient to study 2 mock microbial communities in a multiplex manner and to almost completely reconstruct the microbial diversity contained in the HM782D and D6305 mock communities. Although nanopore-based sequencing produces reads with lower per-base accuracy compared with other platforms, we presented a novel approach consisting of multi-locus and long amplicon sequencing using the MinIONTM MkIb DNA sequencer and R9 and R9.4 chemistries that help to overcome the main disadvantage of this portable sequencing platform. Furthermore, the nanopore sequencing library, constructed with the last releases of pore chemistry (R9.4) and sequencing kit (SQK-LSK108), permitted the retrieval of the higher level of 1D read accuracy sufficient to characterize the microbial species present in each mock community analysed. Improvements in nanopore chemistry, such as minimizing base-calling errors and new library protocols able to produce rapid 1D libraries, will provide more reliable information in the near future. Such data will be useful for more comprehensive and faster specific detection of microbial species and strains in complex ecosystems. © The Author 2017.

Despite recent advances, many aspects of the biomineralization process and its evolutionary origin remain unknown. The pearl oyster Pinctada fucata martensii is a well-known master of biomineralization, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie its production of shells and pearls are not fully understood. We sequenced the highly polymorphic genome of the pearl oyster and conducted multi-omic and biochemical studies to probe nacre formation. We identified a large set of novel proteins participating in matrix-framework formation, many in expanded families, including components similar to that found in vertebrate bones such as collagen-related VWA-containing proteins, chondroitin sulfotransferases, and regulatory elements. Considering that there are only collagen-based matrices in vertebrate bones and chitin-based matrices in most invertebrate skeletons, the presence of both chitin and elements of collagen-based matrices in nacre suggests that elements of chitin- and collagen-based matrices have deep roots and might be part of an ancient biomineralizing matrix.

Currently available methods work quite well in predicting peptide binding affinity with HLA alleles such as HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*0101, and HLA-B*0702 in terms of sensitivity and specificity. However, quite a few types of HLA alleles that are present in the majority of human populations including HLA-A*0202, HLA-A*0203, HLA-A*6802, HLA-B*5101, HLA-B*5301, HLA-B*5401, and HLA-B*5701 still cannot be predicted with satisfactory accuracy using currently available methods. Furthermore, currently the most popularly used methods for predicting peptide binding affinity are inefficient in identifying neoantigens from a large quantity of whole genome and transcriptome sequencing data. Here we present a Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM)-based software called PSSMHCpan to accurately and efficiently predict peptide binding affinity with a broad coverage of HLA class I alleles. We evaluated the performance of PSSMHCpan by analyzing 10-fold cross-validation on a training database containing 87 HLA alleles and obtained an average area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.94 and accuracy (ACC) of 0.85. In an independent dataset (Peptide Database of Cancer Immunity) evaluation, PSSMHCpan is substantially better than the popularly used NetMHC-4.0, NetMHCpan-3.0, PickPocket, Nebula, and SMM with a sensitivity of 0.90, as compared to 0.74, 0.81, 0.77, 0.24, and 0.79. In addition, PSSMHCpan is more than 197 times faster than NetMHC-4.0, NetMHCpan-3.0, PickPocket, sNebula, and SMM when predicting neoantigens from 661 263 peptides from a breast tumor sample. Finally, we built a neoantigen prediction pipeline and identified 117 017 neoantigens from 467 cancer samples of various cancers from TCGA. PSSMHCpan is superior to the currently available methods in predicting peptide binding affinity with a broad coverage of HLA class I alleles. © The Author 2017.","Alleles; Antigens, Neoplasm; Histocompatibility Antigens Class I; Humans; Neoplasms; Peptides; Protein Binding; Software; HLA A antigen; HLA antigen class 1; HLA B antigen; transcriptome; HLA antigen class 1; peptide; protein binding; tumor antigen; amino acid sequence; area under the curve; Article; binding affinity; cancer immunotherapy; controlled study; human; limit of quantitation; measurement accuracy; prediction; priority journal; protein function; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; allele; genetics; metabolism; neoplasm; software","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033570856"

This has created a need for low-cost laboratory information management systems (LIMS) that contain flexible fields to accommodate the unique nature of individual labs. Many labs do not have a dedicated information technology position, so LIMS must also be easy to setup and maintain with minimal technical proficiency. Findings: MetaLIMS is a free and open-source web-based application available via GitHub. The focus of MetaLIMS is to store sample metadata prior to sequencing and analysis pipelines. Initially designed for environmental metagenomics labs, in addition to storing generic sample collection information and DNA/RNA processing information, the user can also add fields specific to the user's lab. MetaLIMS can also produce a basic sequencing submission form compatible with the proprietary Clarity LIMS system used by some sequencing facilities. To help ease the technical burden associated with web deployment, MetaLIMS options the use of commercial web hosting combined with MetaLIMS bash scripts for ease of setup. Conclusions: MetaLIMS overcomes key challenges common in LIMS by giving labs access to a low-cost and open-source tool that also has the flexibility to meet individual lab needs and an option for easy deployment. By making the web application open source and hosting it on GitHub, we hope to encourage the community to build upon MetaLIMS, making it more robust and tailored to the needs of more researchers. © The Author 2017.","Database Management Systems; Internet; Laboratories; Management Information Systems; Metagenomics; Software; User-Computer Interface; DNA; RNA; Article; computer interface; gene sequence; genetic database; information processing; laboratory information system; metadata; metagenomics; priority journal; software; database management system; information system; Internet; laboratory; software","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027168057"

Using DNA nanoball and combinational probe anchor synthesis developed from Complete Genomics™ sequencing technologies, it generates short reads at a large scale. Here, we present the first human whole-genome sequencing dataset of BGISEQ-500. The dataset was generated by sequencing the widely used cell line HG001 (NA12878) in two sequencing runs of paired-end 50 bp (PE50) and two sequencing runs of paired-end 100 bp (PE100). We also include examples of the raw images from the sequencer for reference. Finally, we identified variations using this dataset, estimated the accuracy of the variations, and compared to that of the variations identified from similar amounts of publicly available HiSeq2500 data. We found similar single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection accuracy for the BGISEQ-500 PE100 data (false positive rate [FPR] = 0.00020%, sensitivity = 96.20%) compared to the PE150 HiSeq2500 data (FPR = 0.00017%, sensitivity = 96.60%) better SNP detection accuracy than the PE50 data (FPR = 0.0006%, sensitivity = 94.15%). But for insertions and deletions (indels), we found lower accuracy for BGISEQ-500 data (FPR = 0.00069% and 0.00067% for PE100 and PE50 respectively, sensitivity = 88.52% and 70.93%) than the HiSeq2500 data (FPR = 0.00032%, sensitivity = 96.28%). Our dataset can serve as the reference dataset, providing basic information not just for future development, but also for all research and applications based on the new sequencing platform.","Cell Line; Gene Library; Genome, Human; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Analysis, DNA; cell line; DNA sequence; gene library; human; human genome; single nucleotide polymorphism","","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040314351"

For example, the varying morphology of trees contributes differently to formation of landscapes, natural habitats of species, and eco-physiological characteristics of the biosphere. Here, we present an algorithm for generating morphological tree ""clones"" based on the detailed reconstruction of the laser scanning data, statistical measure of similarity, and a plant growth model with simple stochastic rules. The algorithm is designed to produce tree forms, i.e., morphological clones, similar (and not identical) in respect to tree-level structure, but varying in fine-scale structural detail. Although we opted for certain choices in our algorithm, individual parts may vary depending on the application, making it a general adaptable pipeline. Namely, we showed that a specific multipurpose procedural stochastic growth model can be algorithmically adjusted to produce the morphological clones replicated from the target experimentally measured tree. For this, we developed a statistical measure of similarity (structural distance) between any given pair of trees, which allows for the comprehensive comparing of the tree morphologies by means of empirical distributions describing the geometrical and topological features of a tree. Finally, we developed a programmable interface to manipulate data required by the algorithm. Our algorithm can be used in a variety of applications for exploration of the morphological potential of the growth models (both theoretical and experimental), arising in all sectors of plant science research. © The Author 2017.","Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Models, Biological; Trees; Article; Bayes forest; genetic algorithm; morphological tree clone; nonhuman; pine; plant structures; priority journal; stochastic model; tree; tree growth; algorithm; anatomy and histology; Bayes theorem; biological model; growth, development and aging; tree","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032857287"

Motor imagery (MI)-based BCI is one of the standard concepts of BCI, in that the user can generate induced activity by imagining motor movements. However, variations in performance over sessions and subjects are too severe to overcome easily; therefore, a basic understanding and investigation of BCI performance variation is necessary to find critical evidence of performance variation. Here we present not only EEG datasets for MI BCI from 52 subjects, but also the results of a psychological and physiological questionnaire, EMG datasets, the locations of 3D EEG electrodes, and EEGs for non-task-related states. Findings: We validated our EEG datasets by using the percentage of bad trials, event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis, and classification analysis. After conventional rejection of bad trials, we showed contralateral ERD and ipsilateral ERS in the somatosensory area, which are well-known patterns of MI. Finally, we showed that 73.08% of datasets (38 subjects) included reasonably discriminative information. Conclusions: Our EEG datasets included the information necessary to determine statistical significance; they consisted of well-discriminated datasets (38 subjects) and less-discriminative datasets. These may provide researchers with opportunities to investigate human factors related to MI BCI performance variation, and may also achieve subject-to-subject transfer by using metadata, including a questionnaire, EEG coordinates, and EEGs for non-task-related states. © The Author 2017.

In plants, this problem is exacerbated by the sheer diversity of chemicals that constitute the metabolome, with the number of metabolites in the plant kingdom generally considered to be in excess of 200 000. In this review, we focus on web resources that can be exploited in order to improve analyte and ultimately metabolite identification and quantification. There is a wide range of available software that not only aids in this but also in the related area of peak alignment; however, for the uninitiated, choosing which program to use is a daunting task. For this reason, we provide an overview of the pros and cons of the software as well as comments regarding the level of programing skills required to effectively exploit their basic functions. In addition, the torrent of available genome and transcriptome sequences that followed the advent of next-generation sequencing has opened up further valuable resources for metabolite identification.

Currently, coconut palm is cultivated in 93 countries, including Central and South America, East and West Africa, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, with a total growth area of more than 12 million hectares [1]. Coconut palm is generally classified into 2 main categories: ""Tall"" (flowering 8-10 years after planting) and ""Dwarf"" (flowering 4-6 years after planting), based on morphological characteristics and breeding habits. This Palmae species has a long growth period before reproductive years, which hinders conventional breeding progress. In spite of initial successes, improvements made by conventional breeding have been very slow. In the present study, we obtained de novo sequences of the Cocos nucifera genome: a major genomic resource that could be used to facilitate molecular breeding in Cocos nucifera and accelerate the breeding process in this important crop. A total of 419.67 gigabases (Gb) of raw reads were generated by the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform using a series of paired-end and mate-pair libraries, covering the predicted Cocos nucifera genome length (2.42 Gb, variety ""Hainan Tall"") to an estimated ×173.32 read depth. A total scaffold length of 2.20 Gb was generated (N50 = 418 Kb), representing 90.91% of the genome. The coconut genome was predicted to harbor 28 039 protein-coding genes, which is less than in Phoenix dactylifera (PDK30: 28 889), Phoenix dactylifera (DPV01: 41 660), and Elaeis guineensis (EG5: 34 802). BUSCO evaluation demonstrated that the obtained scaffold sequences covered 90.8% of the coconut genome and that the genome annotation was 74.1% complete. Genome annotation results revealed that 72.75% of the coconut genome consisted of transposable elements, of which long-terminal repeat retrotransposons elements (LTRs) accounted for the largest proportion (92.23%). Comparative analysis of the antiporter gene family and ion channel gene families between C. nucifera and Arabidopsis thaliana indicated that significant gene expansion may have occurred in the coconut involving Na+/H+ antiporter, carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase, potassium-dependent sodium-calcium exchanger, and potassium channel genes. Despite its agronomic importance, C. nucifera is still under-studied. In this report, we present a draft genome of C. nucifera and provide genomic information that will facilitate future functional genomics and molecular-assisted breeding in this crop species. © The Author 2017.","Cocos; Genome, Plant; Molecular Sequence Annotation; carnitine acylcarnitine translocase; carrier protein; potassium channel; sodium calcium exchange protein; sodium proton exchange protein; unclassified drug; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; coconut; controlled study; date (fruit); Elaeis guineensis; gene sequence; genome size; long terminal repeat; nonhuman; plant breeding; plant genome; prediction; priority journal; retroposon; transposon; coconut; genetics; molecular genetics","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042177487"

The size of the datasets, now often captured robotically, often precludes manual inspection, hence the motivation for finding a fully automated approach. Deep learning is an emerging field that promises unparalleled results on many data analysis problems. Building on artificial neural networks, deep approaches have many more hidden layers in the network, and hence have greater discriminative and predictive power. We demonstrate the use of such approaches as part of a plant phenotyping pipeline. We show the success offered by such techniques when applied to the challenging problem of image-based plant phenotyping and demonstrate state-of-the-art results (>97% accuracy) for root and shoot feature identification and localization. We use fully automated trait identification using deep learning to identify quantitative trait loci in root architecture datasets. The majority (12 out of 14) of manually identified quantitative trait loci were also discovered using our automated approach based on deep learning detection to locate plant features. We have shown deep learning-based phenotyping to have very good detection and localization accuracy in validation and testing image sets. We have shown that such features can be used to derive meaningful biological traits, which in turn can be used in quantitative trait loci discovery pipelines. This process can be completely automated. We predict a paradigm shift in image-based phenotyping bought about by such deep learning approaches, given sufficient training sets. © The Author 2017.","Machine Learning; Phenotype; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Plants; Quantitative Trait Loci; Triticum; Article; artificial neural network; automation; classification; deep machine learning; image analysis; image processing; learning algorithm; machine learning; nonhuman; phenotype; plant; plant root; priority journal; quantitative trait locus; shoot; validation process; classification; genetics; phenotype; plant; wheat","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032854973"

However, studies of human retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (RIPs) based on whole-genome deep sequencing at the population level have not been sufficiently undertaken, despite the obvious need for a thorough characterization of RIPs in the general population. Herein, we present a novel and efficient computational tool called Specific Insertions Detector (SID) for the detection of non-reference RIPs. We demonstrate that SID is suitable for high-depth whole-genome sequencing data using paired-end reads obtained from simulated and real datasets. We construct a comprehensive RIP database using a large population of 90 Han Chinese individuals with a mean ×68 depth per individual. In total, we identify 9342 recent RIPs, and 8433 of these RIPs are novel compared with dbRIP, including 5826 Alu, 2169 long interspersed nuclear element 1 (L1), 383 SVA, and 55 long terminal repeats. Among the 9342 RIPs, 4828 were located in gene regions and 5 were located in protein-coding regions. We demonstrate that RIPs can, in principle, be an informative resource to perform population evolution and phylogenetic analyses. Taking the demographic effects into account, we identify a weak negative selection on SVA and L1 but an approximately neutral selection for Alu elements based on the frequency spectrum of RIPs. SID is a powerful open-source program for the detection of non-reference RIPs. We built a non-reference RIP dataset that greatly enhanced the diversity of RIPs detected in the general population, and it should be invaluable to researchers interested in many aspects of human evolution, genetics, and disease. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that the RIPs can be used as biomarkers in a similar way as single nucleotide polymorphisms. © The Author 2017.","Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Genome, Human; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Polymorphism, Genetic; Retroelements; Whole Genome Sequencing; biological marker; Article; controlled study; demography; gene; gene construct; gene insertion; genetic analysis; genetic code; genetic conservation; genetic database; genetic identification; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; genetics; Han Chinese; human; human cell; long interspersed repeat; long terminal repeat; mathematical model; phylogeny; population; priority journal; promoter region; retroposon; retrotransposon insertion polymorphism; simulation; single nucleotide polymorphism; Specific Insertion Detector; SVA gene; whole genome sequencing; Asian continental ancestry group; high throughput sequencing; human genome; procedures","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031815353"

We describe the Multigenomic Entropy Based Score pipeline (MEBS), a software platform designed to evaluate, compare, and infer complex metabolic pathways in large ""omic"" datasets, including entire biogeochemical cycles. MEBS is open source and available through https://github.com/eead-csic-compbio/metagenome Pfam score. To demonstrate its use, we modeled the sulfur cycle by exhaustively curating the molecular and ecological elements involved (compounds, genes, metabolic pathways, and microbial taxa). This information was reduced to a collection of 112 characteristic Pfam protein domains and a list of complete-sequenced sulfur genomes. Using the mathematical framework of relative entropy (H'), we quantitatively measured the enrichment of these domains among sulfur genomes. The entropy of each domain was used both to build up a final score that indicates whether a (meta)genomic sample contains the metabolic machinery of interest and to propose marker domains in metagenomic sequences such as DsrC (PF04358). MEBS was benchmarked with a dataset of 2107 non-redundant microbial genomes from RefSeq and 935 metagenomes from MG-RAST. Its performance, reproducibility, and robustness were evaluated using several approaches, including random sampling, linear regression models, receiver operator characteristic plots, and the area under the curve metric (AUC). Our results support the broad applicability of this algorithm to accurately classify (AUC = 0.985) hard-to-culture genomes (e.g., Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator), previously characterized ones, and metagenomic environments such as hydrothermal vents, or deep-sea sediment. Our benchmark indicates that an entropy-based score can capture the metabolic machinery of interest and can be used to efficiently classify large genomic and metagenomic datasets, including uncultivated/unexplored taxa. © The Author 2017.","Animals; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metagenome; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software; Sulfur; acetic acid; alkanesulfonic acid; carbon disulfide; cysteic acid; dimethyl sulfide; dimethyl sulfone; dimethylsulfoniopropionate; homotaurine; lactic acid; mesylic acid; methanethiol; methylthiopropanoate; propionic acid; sulfate; sulfide; sulfite; sulfoacetaldehyde; sulfoacetate; sulfolactate; sulfur; taurine; tetrathionic acid; thiosulfate; unclassified drug; amino acid sequence; Article; catalysis; DNA sequence; entropy; gene sequence; genetic algorithm; genetic distance; hidden Markov model; linear regression analysis; metagenomics; microbial genome; Multigenomic Entropy Based Score pipeline; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; protein domain; reproducibility; sequence alignment; animal; genetics; human; intestine flora; metabolism; metagenome; procedures; software","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042176835"

Molecular mechanisms of EDP have been traditionally studied by identifying single or small subsets of targets along the biochemical pathways that link synaptic receptors to nuclear processes. Recent technological advances in large-scale analysis of gene transcription and translation now allow systematic observation of thousands of molecules simultaneously. Here we employed label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to address experience-dependent changes in the proteome after sensory deprivation of the primary somatosensory cortex. Cortical column- and layer-specific tissue samples were collected from control animals, with all whiskers intact, and animals whose C-row whiskers were bilaterally plucked for 11-14 days. Thirty-three samples from cortical layers (L) 2/3 and L4 spanning across control, deprived, and first- and second-order spared columns yielded at least 10 000 peptides mapping to ~5000 protein groups. Of these, 4676 were identified with high confidence, and >3000 were found in all samples. This comprehensive database provides a snapshot of the proteome after whisker deprivation, a protocol that has been widely used to unravel the synaptic, cellular, and network mechanisms of EDP. Complementing the recently made available transcriptome for identical experimental conditions (see the accompanying article by Kole et al.), the database can be used to (i) mine novel targets whose translation is modulated by sensory organ use, (ii) cross-validate experimental protocols from the same developmental time point, and (iii) statistically map the molecular pathways of cortical plasticity at a columnar and laminar resolution. © The Author 2017.","Animals; Female; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Proteomics; Sensory Deprivation; Somatosensory Cortex; amino acid sequence; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; cortex layer II; cortex layer III; cortex layer IV; experience dependent plasticity; mass spectrometry; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; peptide mapping; primary somatosensory cortex; priority journal; protein modification; proteomics; sensory deprivation; vibrissa; animal; C57BL mouse; female; metabolism; physiology; sensory deprivation; somatosensory cortex","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032857044"

However, the firefly is in danger of extinction because of the massive destruction of its living environment. In order to improve the understanding of fireflies and protect them effectively, we sequenced the whole genome of the terrestrial firefly Pyrocoelia pectoralis. Findings: Here, we developed a highly reliable genome resource for the terrestrial firefly Pyrocoelia pectoralis (E. Oliv., 1883; Coleoptera: Lampyridae) using single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing on the PacBio Sequel platform. In total, 57.8 Gb of long reads were generated and assembled into a 760.4-Mb genome, which is close to the estimated genome size and covered 98.7% complete and 0.7% partial insect Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs. The k-mer analysis showed that this genome is highly heterozygous. However, our long-read assembly demonstrates continuousness with a contig N50 length of 3.04 Mb and the longest contig length of 13.69 Mb. Furthermore, 135 589 SSRs and 341 Mb of repeat sequences were detected. A total of 23 092 genes were predicted; 88.44% of genes were annotated with one or more related functions. Conclusions: We assembled a high-quality firefly genome, which will not only provide insights into the conservation and biodiversity of fireflies, but also provide a wealth of information to study the mechanisms of their sexual communication, bio-luminescence, and evolution. © The Author(s) 2017.","Animals; Chromosome Mapping; Female; Fireflies; Genome Size; Genome, Insect; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Whole Genome Sequencing; amino acid sequence; Article; biodiversity; contig mapping; Drosophila melanogaster; firefly; gene function; gene library; gene sequence; genetic conservation; genome analysis; genome size; heterozygote; insect genome; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; Pyrocoelia pectoralis; sequence analysis; animal; chromosomal mapping; female; firefly; genetics; molecular genetics; procedures; whole genome sequencing","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042380025"

However, the genetic background of ginseng remains poorly understood, partly because of the plant's large and complex genome composition. We report the entire genome sequence of Panax ginseng using next-generation sequencing. The 3.5-Gb nucleotide sequence contains more than 60% repeats and encodes 42 006 predicted genes. Twenty-two transcriptome datasets and mass spectrometry images of ginseng roots were adopted to precisely quantify the functional genes. Thirty-one genes were identified to be involved in the mevalonic acid pathway. Eight of these genes were annotated as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductases, which displayed diverse structures and expression characteristics. A total of 225 UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) were identified, and these UGTs accounted for one of the largest gene families of ginseng. Tandem repeats contributed to the duplication and divergence of UGTs. Molecular modeling of UGTs in the 71st, 74th, and 94th families revealed a regiospecific conserved motif located at the N-terminus.

In order to address some of these challenges, developers have leveraged virtualization containers toward seamless deployment of preconfigured bioinformatics software and pipelines on any computational platform. We present an approach for abstracting the complex data operations of multistep, bioinformatics pipelines for NGS data analysis. As examples, we have deployed 2 pipelines for RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, preconfigured within Docker virtualization containers we call Bio-Docklets. Each Bio-Docklet exposes a single data input and output endpoint and from a user perspective, running the pipelines as simply as running a single bioinformatics tool. This is achieved using a ""meta-script"" that automatically starts the Bio-Docklets and controls the pipeline execution through the BioBlend software library and the Galaxy Application Programming Interface. The pipeline output is postprocessed by integration with the Visual Omics Explorer framework, providing interactive data visualizations that users can access through a web browser. Our goal is to enable easy access to NGS data analysis pipelines for nonbioinformatics experts on any computing environment, whether a laboratory workstation, university computer cluster, or a cloud service provider. Beyond end users, the Bio-Docklets also enables developers to programmatically deploy and run a large number of pipeline instances for concurrent analysis of multiple datasets. © The Author 2017.

However, the growing sample sizes and the divergent complexity of nonhuman genomes challenge the efficiency and robustness of current human-oriented CNV detection methods. Results: Here, we present CNVcaller, a read-depth method for discovering CNVs in population sequencing data. The computational speed of CNVcaller was 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than CNVnator and Genome STRiP for complex genomes with thousands of unmapped scaffolds. CNV detection of 232 goats required only 1.4 days on a single compute node. Additionally, the Mendelian consistency of sheep trios indicated that CNVcaller mitigated the influence of high proportions of gaps and misassembled duplications in the nonhuman reference genome assembly. Furthermore, multiple evaluations using real sheep and human data indicated that CNVcaller achieved the best accuracy and sensitivity for detecting duplications. Conclusions: The fast generalized detection algorithms included in CNVcaller overcome prior computational barriers for detecting CNVs in large-scale sequencing data with complex genomic structures. Therefore, CNVcaller promotes population genetic analyses of functional CNVs in more species. © The Author(s) 2017.","Algorithms; Animals; Computational Biology; DNA Copy Number Variations; Genetics, Population; Genome Size; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software; computational fluid dynamics; controlled study; copy number variation; gene duplication; gene identification; genetic algorithm; genome analysis; human; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; Note; population genetics; priority journal; sheep; single nucleotide polymorphism; software; algorithm; animal; biology; DNA sequence; genome size; high throughput sequencing; procedures; software","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042375087"

Although a number of such platforms have been applied to ancient DNA samples, the Illumina series are the dominant choice today, mainly because of high production capacities and short read production. Recently a potentially attractive alternative platform for palaeogenomic data generation has been developed, the BGISEQ-500, whose sequence output are comparable with the Illumina series. In this study, we modified the standard BGISEQ-500 library preparation specifically for use on degraded DNA, then directly compared the sequencing performance and data quality of the BGISEQ-500 to the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform on DNA extracted from 8 historic and ancient dog and wolf samples. The data generated were largely comparable between sequencing platforms, with no statistically significant difference observed for parameters including level (P = 0.371) and average sequence length (P = 0718) of endogenous nuclear DNA, sequence GC content (P = 0.311), double-stranded DNA damage rate (v. 0.309), and sequence clonality (P = 0.093). Small significant differences were found in single-strand DNA damage rate (dS; slightly lower for the BGISEQ-500, P = 0.011) and the background rate of difference from the reference genome (θ slightly higher for BGISEQ-500, P = 0.012). This may result from the differences in amplification cycles used to polymerase chain reaction-amplify the libraries. A significant difference was also observed in the mitochondrial DNA percentages recovered (P = 0.018), although we believe this is likely a stochastic effect relating to the extremely low levels of mitochondria that were sequenced from 3 of the samples with overall very low levels of endogenous DNA. Although we acknowledge that our analyses were limited to animal material, our observations suggest that the BGISEQ-500 holds the potential to represent a valid and potentially valuable alternative platform for palaeogenomic data generation that is worthy of future exploration by those interested in the sequencing and analysis of degraded DNA. © The Author 2017.

These noncoding RNA transcripts are known to affect expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) via epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulation. Given their widespread target spectrum, as well as extensive modes of action, a complete understanding of their biological relevance will depend on integrative analyses of systems data at various levels. Findings: While a handful of publicly available databases have been reported, existing tools do not fully capture, from a network perspective, the functional implications of lncRNAs or circRNAs of interest. Through an integrated and streamlined design, circlncRNAnet aims to broaden the understanding of ncRNA candidates by testing in silico several hypotheses of ncRNA-based functions, on the basis of large-scale RNA-seq data. This web server is implemented with several features that represent advances in the bioinformatics of ncRNAs: (1) a flexible framework that accepts and processes user-defined next-generation sequencing-based expression data; (2) multiple analytic modules that assign and productively assess the regulatory networks of user-selected ncRNAs by cross-referencing extensively curated databases; (3) an all-purpose, information-rich workflow design that is tailored to all types of ncRNAs. Outputs on expression profiles, co-expression networks and pathways, and molecular interactomes, are dynamically and interactively displayed according to user-defined criteria. Conclusions: In short, users may apply circlncRNAnet to obtain, in real time, multiple lines of functionally relevant information on circRNAs/lncRNAs of their interest.

The ELIXIR Tools and Data Services Registry (bio.tools) aims to provide a central information point, independent of any specific scientific scope within bioinformatics or technological implementation. Meanwhile, efforts to integrate bioinformatics software in workbench and workflow environments have accelerated to enable the design, automation, and reproducibility of bioinformatics experiments. One such popular environment is the Galaxy framework, with currently more than 80 publicly available Galaxy servers around the world. In the context of a generic registry for bioinformatics software, such as bio.tools, Galaxy instances constitute a major source of valuable content. Yet there has been, to date, no convenient mechanism to register such services en masse. Findings: We present ReGaTE (Registration of Galaxy Tools in Elixir), a software utility that automates the process of registering the services available in a Galaxy instance. This utility uses the BioBlend application program interface to extract service metadata from a Galaxy server, enhance the metadata with the scientific information required by bio.tools, and push it to the registry.

The Seriola species of interest to Mediterranean aquaculture is the greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili). This species holds great potential for the aquaculture industry, but in captivity, reproduction has proved to be challenging, and observed growth dysfunction hinders their domestication. Insights into molecular mechanisms may contribute to a better understanding of traits like growth and sex, but investigations to unravel the molecular background of amberjacks have begun only recently. Findings: Illumina HiSeq sequencing generated a high-coverage greater amberjack genome sequence comprising 45 909 scaffolds. Comparative mapping to the Japanese yellowtail (Seriola quinqueriadiata) and to the model species medaka (Oryzias latipes) allowed the generation of in silico groups. Additional gonad transcriptome sequencing identified sex-biased transcripts, including known sex-determining and differentiation genes. Investigation of the muscle transcriptome of slow-growing individuals showed that transcripts involved in oxygen and gas transport were differentially expressed compared with fast/normal-growing individuals. On the other hand, transcripts involved in muscle functions were found to be enriched in fast/normal-growing individuals. Conclusion: The present study provides the first insights into the molecular background of male and female amberjacks and of fast- and slow-growing fish. Therefore, valuable molecular resources have been generated in the form of a first draft genome and a reference transcriptome. Sex-biased genes, which may also have roles in sex determination or differentiation, and genes that may be responsible for slow growth are suggested. © The Author(s) 2017.","Animals; Female; Fish Proteins; Fishes; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gonads; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Male; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Muscles; Organ Specificity; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sex Characteristics; transcriptome; fish protein; animal tissue; aquaculture; Article; controlled study; female; fish; gas transport; gene expression; gene mapping; gene sequence; genome; genome analysis; male; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; Oryzias latipes; oxygen transport; priority journal; Seriola dumerili; Seriola quinqueriadiata; sex determination; sex differentiation; species difference; transcriptomics; animal; antibody specificity; classification; DNA sequence; fish; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; gonad; high throughput sequencing; metabolism; molecular genetics; muscle; procedures; sexual characteristics","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042364258"

As machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to support clinical decision making, it is vital to reliably quantify their prediction accuracy. Cross-validation (CV) is the standard approach where the accuracy of such algorithms is evaluated on part of the data the algorithm has not seen during training. However, for this procedure to be meaningful, the relationship between the training and the validation set should mimic the relationship between the training set and the dataset expected for the clinical use. Here we compared two popular CV methods: record-wise and subject-wise. While the subject-wise method mirrors the clinically relevant use-case scenario of diagnosis in newly recruited subjects, the record-wise strategy has no such interpretation. Using both a publicly available dataset and a simulation, we found that record-wise CV often massively overestimates the prediction accuracy of the algorithms. We also conducted a systematic review of the relevant literature, and found that this overly optimistic method was used by almost half of the retrieved studies that used accelerometers, wearable sensors, or smartphones to predict clinical outcomes. As we move towards an era of machine learning-based diagnosis and treatment, using proper methods to evaluate their accuracy is crucial, as inaccurate results can mislead both clinicians and data scientists. © The Author 2017.

Commercially, there is now a growing trend away from using wine yeast (Saccharomyces) starter cultures, toward the historic practice of uninoculated or ""wild"" fermentation, where the yeasts and bacteria associated with the grapes and/or winery perform the fermentation. It is the varied metabolic contributions of these numerous non-Saccharomyces species that are thought to impart complexity and desirable taste and aroma attributes to wild ferments in comparison to their inoculated counterparts. To map the microflora of spontaneous fermentation, metagenomic techniques were employed to characterize and monitor the progression of fungal species in 5 different wild fermentations. Both amplicon-based ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylotyping and shotgun metagenomics were used to assess community structure across different stages of fermentation. While providing a sensitive and highly accurate means of characterizing the wine microbiome, the shotgun metagenomic data also uncovered a significant overabundance bias in the ITS phylotyping abundance estimations for the common non-Saccharomyces wine yeast genus Metschnikowia. By identifying biases such as that observed for Metschnikowia, abundance measurements from future ITS phylotyping datasets can be corrected to provide more accurate species representation. Ultimately, as more shotgun metagenomic and single-strain de novo assemblies for key wine species become available, the accuracy of both ITS-amplicon and shotgun studies will greatly increase, providing a powerful methodology for deciphering the influence of the microbial community on the wine flavor and aroma. © The Author 2017.

Highly multiplexed measurements of cellular morphology can be extracted from each image and subsequently mined for a number of applications. Findings: This microscopy dataset includes 919 265 five-channel fields of view, representing 30 616 tested compounds, available at ""The Cell Image Library"" (CIL) repository. It also includes data files containing morphological features derived from each cell in each image, both at the single-cell level and population-averaged (i.e., per-well) level; the image analysis workflows that generated the morphological features are also provided. Quality-control metrics are provided as metadata, indicating fields of view that are out-of-focus or containing highly fluorescent material or debris. Lastly, chemical annotations are supplied for the compound treatments applied. Conclusions: Because computational algorithms and methods for handling single-cell morphological measurements are not yet routine, the dataset serves as a useful resource for the wider scientific community applying morphological (image-based) profiling. The dataset can be mined for many purposes, including small-molecule library enrichment and chemical mechanism-of-action studies, such as target identification. Integration with genetically perturbed datasets could enable identification of small-molecule mimetics of particular disease- or gene-related phenotypes that could be useful as probes or potential starting points for development of future therapeutics. © The Author(s) 2017.","Cell Line; Cells; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Small Molecule Libraries; cell assay; cell painting assay; cell structure; computational fluid dynamics; image analysis; information processing; microscopy; Note; phenotype; priority journal; quality control; quantitative analysis; cell line; cells; drug effect; human; image processing; molecular library; ultrastructure","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040750802"

However, often genes of interest are not completely or accurately assembled, leading to unknown errors in analyses or additional cloning efforts for the correct sequences. A promising solution is long-read sequencing. Here we tested PacBio-based long-read sequencing and diploid assembly for potential improvements to the Sanger-based intermediate-read zebra finch reference and Illumina-based short-read Anna's hummingbird reference, 2 vocal learning avian species widely studied in neuroscience and genomics. With DNA of the same individuals used to generate the reference genomes, we generated diploid assemblies with the FALCON-Unzip assembler, resulting in contigs with no gaps in the megabase range, representing 150-fold and 200-fold improvements over the current zebra finch and hummingbird references, respectively. These long-read and phased assemblies corrected and resolved what we discovered to be numerous misassemblies in the references, including missing sequences in gaps, erroneous sequences flanking gaps, base call errors in difficult-to-sequence regions, complex repeat structure errors, and allelic differences between the 2 haplotypes. These improvements were validated by single long-genome and transcriptome reads and resulted for the first time in completely resolved protein-coding genes widely studied in neuroscience and specialized in vocal learning species. These findings demonstrate the impact of long reads, sequencing of previously difficult-to-sequence regions, and phasing of haplotypes on generating the high-quality assemblies necessary for understanding gene structure, function, and evolution. © The Author 2017.","Animals; Avian Proteins; Birds; Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1; Early Growth Response Protein 1; Female; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Genome; Male; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Sequence Analysis, DNA; DNA; transcriptome; avian protein; early growth response factor 1; forkhead transcription factor; mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase 1; nerve protein; analytical error; Article; based intermediate read sequencing; based long read sequencing; based short read sequencing; bird; chromatin assembly and disassembly; diploidy; DNA flanking region; DNMT3A gene; DRD4 gene; DUSP1 gene; evolution; FOXP2 gene; frameshift mutation; gene function; gene sequence; gene structure; genetic code; genome; genomics; haplotype; learning; neuroscience; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; reference gene; Sanger sequencing; SAP30 gene; sequence analysis; SLIT1 gene; vocalization; animal; bird; DNA sequence; female; genetics; male","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032853801"

DNA detection of animals from non-invasive samples, such as predator faeces (scats) that contain traces of DNA from their species of origin, has proved to be a valuable tool for the management of elusive wildlife. However, application of this approach can be limited by the availability of appropriate genetic markers. Scat DNA is often degraded, meaning that longer DNA sequences, including standard DNA barcoding markers, are difficult to recover. Instead, targeted short diagnostic markers are required to serve as diagnostic mini-barcodes. The mitochondrial genome is a useful source of such trace DNA markers because it provides good resolution at the species level and occurs in high copy numbers per cell. We developed a mini-barcode based on a short (178 bp) fragment of the conserved 12S ribosomal ribonucleic acid mitochondrial gene sequence, with the goal of discriminating amongst the scats of large mammalian predators of Australia. We tested the sensitivity and specificity of our primers and can accurately detect and discriminate amongst quolls, cats, dogs, foxes, and devils from trace DNA samples. Our approach provides a cost-effective, time-efficient, and non-invasive tool that enables identification of all 8 medium-large mammal predators in Australia, including native and introduced species, using a single test.

The Southern Ocean has cooled to -1.8oC over the past 30 million years, and the seawater had retained this cold temperature and isolated oceanic environment because of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Notothenioids dominate Antarctic fish, making up 90% of the biomass, and all notothenioids have undergone molecular and ecological diversification to survive in this cold environment. Therefore, they are considered an attractive Antarctic fish model for evolutionary and ancestral genomic studies. Bathydraconidae is a speciose family of the Notothenioidei, the dominant taxonomic component of Antarctic teleosts. To understand the process of evolution of Antarctic fish, we select a typical Antarctic bathydraconid dragonfish, P. charcoti. Here, we have sequenced, de novo assembled, and annotated a comprehensive genome from P. charcoti. The draft genome of P. charcoti is 709 Mb in size. The N50 contig length is 6145 bp, and its N50 scaffold length 178 362 kb. The genome of P. charcoti is predicted to contain 32 712 genes, 18 455 of which have been assigned preliminary functions. A total of 8951 orthologous groups common to 7 species of fish were identified, while 333 genes were identified in P. charcoti only; 2519 orthologous groups were also identified in both P. charcoti and N. coriiceps, another Antarctic fish. Four gene ontology terms were statistically overrepresented among the 333 genes unique to P. charcoti, according to gene ontology enrichment analysis. The draft P. charcoti genome will broaden our understanding of the evolution of Antarctic fish in their extreme environment. It will provide a basis for further investigating the unusual characteristics of Antarctic fishes. © The Author 2017.","Animals; Antarctic Regions; Computational Biology; Evolution, Molecular; Fishes; Gene Library; Genetic Variation; Genome; Genome Size; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Phylogeny; contig; genomic DNA; Antarctica; Article; DNA sequence; gene ontology; genome; genome size; nonhuman; Notothenia coriiceps; Parachaenichthys charcoti; priority journal; teleost; animal; biology; classification; fish; gene library; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; high throughput sequencing; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; phylogeny; procedures","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042182148"

In recent years, this representation experienced a theoretical and computational revolution that is breaching neuroscience, allowing us to cope with the increasing complexity of the human brain across multiple scales and in multiple dimensions and to model structural and functional connectivity from new perspectives, often combined with each other.

Taking examples from marine research, we summarize essential variables used to describe material sampling processes and sequencing procedures in a metagenomics experiment. These aspects of metagenomics dataset generation have been to some extent addressed by the scientific community, but greater awareness and adoption is still needed. We emphasize the lack of standards relating to reporting how metagenomics datasets are analysed and how the metagenomics data analysis outputs should be archived and published.

Computational analyses of live imaging exploit the rich temporal information and significantly improve understanding of complex phenomena that emerge during this mode of collective motility. Publicly available experimental data can allow application of new analyses to promote new discoveries, and assess algorithms' capabilities to distinguish between different experimental conditions.Findings: A freely-available dataset of 31 time-lapse in vitro wound healing experiments of two cell lines is presented. It consists of six different experimental conditions with 4-6 replicates each, gathered to study the effects of a growth factor on collective cell migration. The raw data is available at 'The Cell: an Image Library' repository. This Data Note provides detailed description of the data, intermediately processed data, scripts and experimental validations that have not been reported before and are currently available at GigaDB. This is the first publicly available repository of live collective cell migration data that includes independent replicates for each set of conditions.Conclusions: This dataset has the potential for extensive reuse. Some aspects in the data remain unexplored and can be exploited extensively to reveal new insight. The dataset could also be used to assess the performance of available and new quantification methods by demonstrating phenotypic discriminatory capabilities between the different experimental conditions.

In North America, it has become notorious as an intentionally released invasive species. Its ability to breathe air with gills and migrate short distances over land makes it a good model for bimodal breath research. Therefore, recent research has focused on the identification of relevant candidate genes. Here, we performed whole genome sequencing of C. argus to construct its draft genome, aiming to offer useful information for further functional studies and identification of target genes related to its unusual facultative air breathing. Findings: We assembled the C. argus genome with a total of 140.3 Gb of raw reads, which were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. The final draft genome assembly was approximately 615.3 Mb, with a contig N50 of 81.4 kb and scaffold N50 of 4.5 Mb. The identified repeat sequences account for 18.9% of the whole genome. The 19 877 protein-coding genes were predicted from the genome assembly, with an average of 10.5 exons per gene. Conclusion: We generated a high-quality draft genome of C. argus, which will provide a valuable genetic resource for further biomedical investigations of this economically important teleost fish. © The Author 2017.","Animals; Computational Biology; Genome; Genome Size; Genomics; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Multigene Family; Perciformes; Phylogeny; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Whole Genome Sequencing; contig; breathing; Channa; Channa argus; exon; gene targeting; genetic identification; genome; nonhuman; Note; nucleotide repeat; priority journal; whole genome sequencing; animal; biology; classification; DNA sequence; genetics; genome size; genomics; molecular genetics; multigene family; Perciformes; phylogeny; procedures","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023175132"

Geckos possess a suite of distinctive characteristics, including adhesive digits, nocturnal activity, hard, calcareous eggshells, and a lack of eyelids. However, one gecko clade, the Eublepharidae, appears to be the exception to most of these 'rules' and lacks adhesive toe pads, has eyelids, and lays eggs with soft, leathery eggshells. These differences make eublepharids an important component of any investigation into the underlying genomic innovations contributing to the distinctive phenotypes in 'typical' geckos. Findings: We report high-depth genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation for a male leopard gecko, Eublepharis macularius (Eublepharidae). Illumina sequence data were generated from seven insert libraries (ranging from 170 to 20 kb), representing a raw sequencing depth of 136X from 303 Gb of data, reduced to 84X and 187 Gb after filtering. The assembled genome of 2.02 Gb was close to the 2.23 Gb estimated by k-mer analysis. Scaffold and contig N50 sizes of 664 and 20 kb, respectively, were comparable to the previously published Gekko japonicus genome. Repetitive elements accounted for 42 % of the genome. Gene annotation yielded 24,755 protein-coding genes, of which 93 % were functionally annotated. CEGMA and BUSCO assessment showed that our assembly captured 91 % (225 of 248) of the core eukaryotic genes, and 76 % of vertebrate universal single-copy orthologs. Conclusions: Assembly of the leopard gecko genome provides a valuable resource for future comparative genomic studies of geckos and other squamate reptiles. © The Author(s).","Animals; Contig Mapping; Genome; Genome Size; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Lizards; Male; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Sequence Analysis, DNA; amino acid sequence; Article; conserved sequence; contig mapping; Eublepharis macularius; Gekko japonicus; genetic code; genome; genome analysis; genome size; male; molecular genetics; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; nucleotide repeat; orthology; reptile; sequence analysis; species comparison; animal; DNA sequence; genetics; genome; high throughput sequencing; lizard; procedures","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015983672"

Classical analysis processes for such data often begin with an assembly step, needing large amounts of computing resources, and potentially removing or modifying parts of the biological information contained in the data. Our approach proposes to focus directly on biological questions, by considering raw unassembled NGS data, through a suite of six command-line tools. Findings: Dedicated to 'whole-genome assembly-free' treatments, the Colib'read tools suite uses optimized algorithms for various analyses of NGS datasets, such as variant calling or read set comparisons. Based on the use of a de Bruijn graph and bloom filter, such analyses can be performed in a few hours, using small amounts of memory. Applications using real data demonstrate the good accuracy of these tools compared to classical approaches. To facilitate data analysis and tools dissemination, we developed Galaxy tools and tool shed repositories. Conclusions: With the Colib'read Galaxy tools suite, we enable a broad range of life scientists to analyze raw NGS data. More importantly, our approach allows the maximum biological information to be retained in the data, and uses a very low memory footprint.","Base Sequence; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Genome; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Information Storage and Retrieval; Molecular Sequence Data; Reproducibility of Results; Software; accuracy; alternative RNA splicing; Article; computer program; data analysis; data extraction; de Bruijn graph; human; information dissemination; intermethod comparison; kernel method; metagenomics; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; plots and curves; priority journal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; biology; cluster analysis; genetics; genome; genomics; high throughput sequencing; information retrieval; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; procedures; reproducibility; software","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991526700"

However, their general biology remains poorly understood. We sequenced the genome of Tropilaelaps mercedesae, the prevalent ectoparasitic mite infesting honey bees in Asia, and predicted 15 190 protein-coding genes that were well supported by the mite transcriptomes and proteomic data. Although amino acid substitutions have been accelerated within the conserved core genes of two mites, T. mercedesae and Metaseiulus occidentalis, T. mercedesae has undergone the least gene family expansion and contraction between the seven arthropods we tested. The number of sensory system genes has been dramatically reduced, but T. mercedesae contains all gene sets required to detoxify xenobiotics. T. mercedesae is closely associated with a symbiotic bacterium (Rickettsiella grylli-like) and Deformed Wing Virus, the most prevalent honey bee virus. T. mercedesae has a very specialized life history and habitat as the ectoparasitic mite strictly depends on the honey bee inside a stable colony. Thus, comparison of the genome and transcriptome sequences with those of a tick and free-living mites has revealed the specific features of the genome shaped by interaction with the honey bee and colony environment. Genome and transcriptome sequences of T. mercedesae, as well as Varroa destructor (another globally prevalent ectoparasitic mite of honey bee), not only provide insights into the mite biology, but may also help to develop measures to control the most serious pests of the honey bee. © The Author 2017.","Acari; Animals; Bacteria; Bees; Computational Biology; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Genome; Genomics; Host-Parasite Interactions; Life Cycle Stages; Male; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Organ Specificity; Phylogeny; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Symbiosis; Transcriptome; Viruses; transcriptome; xenobiotic agent; transcriptome; adult; amino acid substitution; Article; controlled study; deformed wing virus; detoxification; female; gene sequence; genetic association; genome; genome analysis; insect virus; male; Metaseiulus occidentalis; mite; mite infestation; nonhuman; nymph; organism colony; parasite development; phylogenetic tree; priority journal; proteomics; sequence analysis; sex determination process; species habitat; Tropilaelaps mercedesae; Varroa destructor; Acari; animal; antibody specificity; bacterium; bee; biology; gene expression profiling; genetics; genomics; host parasite interaction; life cycle stage; molecular genetics; nucleotide repeat; parasitology; phylogeny; procedures; symbiosis; virus","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021859634"

The approach can be applied to phylogenetic analysis of taxonomically selected taxa, as an economical alternative to mitogenome sequencing from individual species, or to environmental samples of mixed specimens, such as from mass trapping of invertebrates. The routine generation of mitochondrial genome sequences has great potential both for systematics and community phylogenetics. Mapping of reads from low-coverage shotgun sequencing of environmental samples also makes it possible to obtain data on spatial and temporal turnover in whole-community phylogenetic and species composition, even in complex ecosystems where species-level taxonomy and biodiversity patterns are poorly known. In addition, read mapping can produce information on species biomass, and potentially allows quantification of within-species genetic variation. The success of MMG relies on the formation of numerous mitochondrial genome contigs, achievable with standard genome assemblers, but various challenges for the efficiency of assembly remain, particularly in the face of variable relative species abundance and intra-specific genetic variation. Nevertheless, several studies have demonstrated the power of mitogenomes from MMG for accurate phylogenetic placement, evolutionary analysis of species traits, biodiversity discovery and the establishment of species distribution patterns; it offers a promising avenue for unifying the ecological and evolutionary understanding of species diversity. © 2016 Crampton-Platt et al.","Animals; Biodiversity; DNA, Mitochondrial; Genetic Variation; Genome, Mitochondrial; Humans; Metagenomics; Phylogeny; Reproducibility of Results; Sequence Analysis, DNA; mitochondrial DNA; biodiversity; bioinformatics; contig mapping; DNA sequence; gene mapping; gene sequence; genetic variability; metagenomics; mitochondrial metagenomics; nonhuman; phylogeny; population distribution; priority journal; Review; species composition; species diversity; taxonomy; animal; chemistry; classification; genetic variation; genetics; human; metagenomics; mitochondrial genome; procedures; reproducibility","BioMed Central Ltd.","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991528457"

Here, we present a framework for streaming analysis of MinION real-time sequence data, together with probabilistic streaming algorithms for species typing, strain typing and antibiotic resistance profile identification. Using four culture isolate samples, as well as a mixed-species sample, we demonstrate that bacterial species and strain information can be obtained within 30 min of sequencing and using about 500 reads, initial drug-resistance profiles within two hours, and complete resistance profiles within 10 h. While strain identification with multi-locus sequence typing required more than 15x coverage to generate confident assignments, our novel gene-presence typing could detect the presence of a known strain with 0.5x coverage.

Two pangolin species (Manis pentadactyla and Manis javanica) have been recorded as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. Optical mapping constructs high-resolution restriction maps from single DNA molecules for genome analysis at the megabase scale and to assist genome assembly. Here, we constructed restriction maps of M. pentadactyla and M. javanica using optical mapping to assist with genome assembly and analysis of these species. Findings: Genomic DNA was nicked with Nt. BspQI and then labeled using fluorescently labeled bases that were detected by the Irys optical mapping system. In total, 3, 313, 734 DNA molecules (517.847 Gb) for M. pentadactyla and 3, 439, 885 DNA molecules (504.743 Gb) for M. javanica were obtained, which corresponded to approximately 178X and 177X genome coverage, respectively.

We obtained two maps that were 2.91 Gb and 2.85 Gb in size with N50s of 1.88Mb and 1.97Mb, respectively. Conclusions: Optical mapping reveals large-scale structural information that is especially important for non-model genomes that lack a good reference. The approach has the potential to guide de novo assembly of genomes sequenced using next-generation sequencing.

Specialized feeding on nutrient-deficient xylem sap is relatively rare among insect herbivores, and only limited genomic and transcriptomic information has been generated for xylem-sap feeders. To develop a more comprehensive understanding of biochemical adaptations and symbiotic relationships that support survival on a nutritionally austere dietary source, transcriptome assemblies for three sharpshooter species and one spittlebug species were produced. Findings: Trinity-based de novo transcriptome assemblies were generated for all four xylem-sap feeders using raw sequencing data originating from whole-insect preps. Total transcripts for each species ranged from 91 384 for Cuerna arida to 106 998 for Homalodisca liturata with transcript totals for Graphocephala atropunctata and the spittlebug Clastoptera arizonana falling in between. The percentage of transcripts comprising complete open reading frames ranged from 60% for H. liturata to 82% for C. arizonana. Bench-marking universal single-copy orthologs analyses for each dataset indicated quality assemblies and a high degree of completeness for all four species. Conclusions: These four transcriptomes represent a significant expansion of data for insect herbivores that feed exclusively on xylem sap, a nutritionally deficient dietary source relative to other plant tissues and fluids. Comparison of transcriptome data with insect herbivores that utilize other dietary sources may illuminate fundamental differences in the biochemistry of dietary specialization. © The Author 2017.","Animals; Feeding Behavior; Gene Expression Profiling; Hemiptera; Insect Vectors; Plant Diseases; Species Specificity; Transcriptome; Xylella; Xylem; transcriptome; transcriptome; Clastoptera arizonana; Cuerna arida; feeding; Graphocephala atropunctata; Homalodisca liturata; insect; nonhuman; Note; open reading frame; orthology; priority journal; transcriptomics; xylem sap; animal; classification; feeding behavior; gene expression profiling; genetics; Hemiptera; insect vector; microbiology; parasitology; physiology; plant disease; procedures; species difference; Xylella; xylem","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023167345"

The increasing number of sequenced reptilian genomes is enabling a deeper understanding of vertebrate evolution, although the genetic basis of the loss of limbs in reptiles remains enigmatic. Here we report genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation for the Asian glass lizard Ophisaurus gracilis, a limbless lizard species with an elongated snake-like body form. Addition of this species to the genome repository will provide an excellent resource for studying the genetic basis of limb loss and trunk elongation.Findings: O. gracilis genome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform resulted in 274.20 Gbp of raw data that was filtered and assembled to a final size of 1.78 Gbp, comprising 6,717 scaffolds with N50 = 1.27 Mbp. Based on the k-mer estimated genome size of 1.71 Gbp, the assembly appears to be nearly 100% complete. A total of 19,513 protein-coding genes were predicted, and 884.06 Mbp of repeat sequences (approximately half of the genome) were annotated.

Over the past four decades, research has advanced the treatment of this cancer from a less than 60% chance of survival to over 85% today. The causal molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we performed sequencing-based genomic DNA methylation profiling of eight paediatric ALL patients using archived bone marrow smear microscope slides.Findings: SOLiD™ sequencing data was collected from Methyl-Binding Domain (MBD) enriched fractions of genomic DNA. The primary tumour and remission bone marrow sample was analysed from eight patients. Four patients relapsed and the relapsed tumour was analysed. Input and MBD-enriched DNA from each sample was sequenced, aligned to the hg19 reference genome and analysed for enrichment peaks using MACS (Model-based Analysis for ChIP-Seq) and HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment). In total, 3.67 gigabases (Gb) were sequenced, 2.74 Gb were aligned to the reference genome (average 74.66% alignment efficiency). This dataset enables the interrogation of differential DNA methylation associated with paediatric ALL. Preliminary results reveal concordant regions of enrichment indicative of a DNA methylation signature.Conclusion: Our dataset represents one of the first SOLiD™MBD-Seq studies performed on paediatric ALL and is the first to utilise archival bone marrow smears. Differential DNA methylation between cancer and equivalent disease-free tissue can be identified and correlated with existing and published genomic studies. Given the rarity of paediatric haematopoietic malignancies, relative to adult counterparts, our demonstration of the utility of archived bone marrow smear samples to high-throughput methylation sequencing approaches offers tremendous potential to explore the role of DNA methylation in the aetiology of cancer. © 2015 Wong et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Bone Marrow; Cell Line, Tumor; Child; Databases, Genetic; DNA Methylation; Humans; Leukemia; Sequence Analysis, DNA; genomic DNA; methyl CpG binding protein 2; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; analytical equipment; Article; bone marrow biopsy; cell isolation; cell population; childhood leukemia; clinical article; controlled study; DNA methylation; DNA sequence; fluorescence activated cell sorting; human; human cell; human tissue; hypergeometric optimization of motif enrichment; leukemia relapse; leukemia remission; methyl binding domain enrichment; model based analysis for chip seq analysis; priority journal; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; bone marrow; child; DNA sequence; genetic database; genetics; leukemia; procedures; tumor cell line","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942424181"

In particular, mapping technologies can generate sparse maps of large DNA fragments (150 kilo base pairs (kbp) to 2Mbp) and thus provide a unique source of information for disambiguating complex rearrangements in cancer genomes. Despite their utility, combining high-throughput sequencing and mapping technologies has been challenging because of the lack of efficient and sensitive map-alignment algorithms for robustly aligning error-prone maps to sequences. Results: We introduce a novel seed-and-extend glocal (short for global-local) alignment method, OPTIMA (and a sliding-window extension for overlap alignment, OPTIMA-Overlap), which is the first to create indexes for continuous-valued mapping data while accounting for mapping errors. We also present a novel statistical model, agnostic with respect to technology-dependent error rates, for conservatively evaluating the significance of alignments without relying on expensive permutation-based tests. Conclusions: We show that OPTIMA and OPTIMA-Overlap outperform other state-of-the-art approaches (1.6 - 2 times more sensitive) and are more efficient (170 - 200 %) and precise in their alignments (nearly 99% precision). These advantages are independent of the quality of the data, suggesting that our indexing approach and statistical evaluation are robust, provide improved sensitivity and guarantee high precision. © 2016 Verzotto et al.","Algorithms; Animals; Chromosome Mapping; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Drosophila melanogaster; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Sequence Alignment; DNA fragment; algorithm; Article; data analysis; Drosophila; gene mapping; genomics; high throughput sequencing; human; intermethod comparison; nonhuman; priority journal; sequence alignment; statistical analysis; statistical model; statistical significance; whole genome alignment; algorithm; animal; biology; chromosomal mapping; computer simulation; Drosophila melanogaster; genetics; genomics; procedures; reproducibility; sequence alignment","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006201196"

TheWest Antarctic Peninsula is the most rapidly warming region on Earth. Organisms living in Antarctic intertidal pools are therefore interesting for research into evolutionary adaptation to extreme environments and the effects of climate change. Findings: We report the whole genome sequence of the Antarctic-endemic harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus kingsejongensi. The 37 Gb raw DNA sequence was generated using the Illumina Miseq platform. Libraries were prepared with 65-fold coverage and a total length of 295 Mb. The final assembly consists of 48 368 contigs with an N50 contig length of 17.5 kb, and 27 823 scaffolds with an N50 contig length of 159.2 kb. A total of 12 772 coding genes were inferred using the MAKER annotation pipeline. Comparative genome analysis revealed that T. kingsejongensis-specific genes are enriched in transport and metabolism processes. Furthermore, rapidly evolving genes related to energy metabolism showed positive selection signatures. Conclusions: The T. kingsejongensis genome provides an interesting example of an evolutionary strategy for Antarctic cold adaptation, and offers new genetic insights into Antarctic intertidal biota. © The Author 2017.

When the region containing this pattern is compared to another population with no history of selection, a rise in variance of allele frequencies between populations is observed. One challenge presented by large genome-wide datasets is the ability to differentiate between patterns that are remnants of natural selection from those expected to arise at random and/or as a consequence of selectively neutral demographic forces acting in the population. Findings: SmileFinder is a simple program that looks for diversity and divergence patterns consistent with selection sweeps by evaluating allele frequencies in windows, including neighboring loci from two or more populations of a diploid species against the genome-wide neutral expectation. The program calculates the mean of heterozygosity and FST in a set of sliding windows of incrementally increasing sizes, and then builds a resampled distribution (the baseline) of random multi-locus sets matched to the sizes of sliding windows, using an unrestricted sampling. Percentiles of the values in the sliding windows are derived from the superimposed resampled distribution. The resampling can easily be scaled from 1 K to 100 M; the higher the number, the more precise the percentiles ascribed to the extreme observed values. Conclusions: The output from SmileFinder can be used to plot percentile values to look for population diversity and divergence patterns that may suggest past actions of positive selection along chromosome maps, and to compare lists of suspected candidate genes under random gene sets to test for the overrepresentation of these patterns among gene categories. Both applications of the algorithm have already been used in published studies. Here we present a publicly available, open source program that will serve as a useful tool for preliminary scans of selection using worldwide databases of human genetic variation, as well as population datasets for many non-human species, from which such data is rapidly emerging with the advent of new genotyping and sequencing technologies. © 2015 Guiblet et al.","Algorithms; Computational Biology; Diploidy; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Heterozygote; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software; Article; chromosome map; computer program; demography; diploidy; gene frequency; gene locus; genetic association; genetic database; genetic marker; genetic screening; genetic variability; genome analysis; genotype; heterozygosity; human genome; natural selection; population genetics; priority journal; sampling; algorithm; biology; diploidy; DNA sequence; genetic selection; heterozygote; population genetics; procedures; software","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942991779"

In many cases, these tasks are carried out by several persons in different places, times, and ways, adding different levels of complexity and error in data collecting. Furthermore, data processing can be time consuming, and input errors may produce unwanted results. Results: We have developed a novel, open source software called Phenobook, an easy, flexible, and intuitive tool to organize, collect, and save experimental data for further analyses. Phenobook was conceived to collect phenotypic observations in a user-friendly, cost-effective way. It consists of a web-based software for experiment design, data input and visualization, and exportation, combined with a mobile application for remote data collecting. We provide in this article a detailed description of the developed tool. Conclusion: Phenobook is a software tool that can be easily implemented in collaborative research and development projects involving data collecting and forward analyses. Adopting Phenobook is expected to improve the involved processes by minimizing input errors, resulting in higher quality and reliability of the research outcomes. © The Author 2017.","Databases, Genetic; Genetic Association Studies; Phenotype; Software; User-Computer Interface; Web Browser; cost effectiveness analysis; mobile application; Note; phenotype; priority journal; computer interface; genetic association study; genetic database; procedures; software; web browser","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023207550"

We developed new methods for parallelization of these tools within Galaxy to accelerate runtime and have demonstrated their usability and summarized their runtimes on multiple cloud service providers. Some tools represent extensions or refinement of existing toolkits to yield visualizations suited to cohort-wide cancer genomic analysis. For example, we present Oncocircos and Oncoprintplus, which generate data-rich summaries of exome-derived somatic mutation. Workflows that integrate these to achieve data integration and visualizations are demonstrated on a cohort of 96 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and enabled the discovery of multiple candidate lymphoma-related genes.

We assembled and annotated a transcriptome from this coral using Illumina sequences from three different developmental stages collected over several years: free-swimming larvae, newly settled larvae, and adults (> 10 cm in diameter). This resource will aid understanding of coral calcification, larval settlement, and host-symbiont interactions. Findings: A de novo transcriptome for the P. astreoides holobiont (coral plus algal symbiont) was assembled using 594 Mbp of raw Illumina sequencing data generated from five age-specific cDNA libraries. The new transcriptome consists of 867 255 transcript elements with an average length of 685 bases. The isolated P. astreoides assembly consists of 129 718 transcript elements with an average length of 811 bases, and the isolated Symbiodinium sp. assembly had 186 177 transcript elements with an average length of 1105 bases.

This forms a foundational genomic and transcriptomic resource that can be used to better understand the physiology and biochemistry of this insect as well as being a useful tool for population genetics.Findings: A transcriptome assembly was constructed containing 17,654 transcript isoforms derived from 10,425 unigenes.

Different approaches have been developed for each type of genome variant and method of its detection, necessitating users to run multiple algorithms to find variants. We present Genome Rearrangement OmniMapper (GROM), a novel comprehensive variant detection algorithm accepting aligned read files as input and finding SNVs, indels, structural variants (SVs), and copy number variants (CNVs). We show that GROM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 7 validated benchmarks using 2 whole genome sequencing (WGS) data sets. Additionally, GROM boasts lightning-fast run times, analyzing a 50× WGS human data set (NA12878) on commonly available computer hardware in 11 minutes, more than an order of magnitude (up to 72 times) faster than tools detecting a similar range of variants. Addressing the needs of big data analysis, GROM combines in 1 algorithm SNV, indel, SV, and CNV detection, providing superior speed, sensitivity, and precision. GROM is also able to detect CNVs, SNVs, and indels in non-paired-read WGS libraries, as well as SNVs and indels in whole exome or RNA sequencing data sets. © The Author 2017.","Genome, Human; Humans; Polymorphism, Genetic; Software; Whole Genome Sequencing; accuracy; computer analysis; copy number variation; gene structure; genetic algorithm; genetic variability; Genome Rearrangement OmniMapper; human; indel mutation; information processing; mathematical computing; Note; priority journal; RNA sequence; sensitivity analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; whole exome sequencing; whole genome sequencing; genetic polymorphism; human genome; procedures; software; standards","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042528987"

It is mainly found off the coasts of northeast Asia. Recently, substantial exploitation and widespread biotic diseases in A. japonicus have generated increasing conservation concern. However, the genomic knowledge base and resources available for researchers to use in managing this natural resource and to establish genetically based breeding systems for sea cucumber aquaculture are still in a nascent stage. A total of 312 Gb of raw sequences were generated using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and assembled to a final size of 0.66 Gb, which is about 80.5% of the estimated genome size (0.82 Gb).We observed nucleotide-level heterozygosity within the assembled genome to be 0.986%. The resulting draft genome assembly comprising 132 607 scaffolds with an N50 value of 10.5 kb contains a total of 21 771 predicted protein-coding genes. We identified 6.6-14.5 million heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the assembled genome of the three natural color variants (green, red, and black), resulting in an estimated nucleotide diversity of 0.00146. We report the first draft genome of A. japonicus and provide a general overview of the genetic variation in the three major color variants of A. japonicus.

However, very few large-scale genetic resources for this species are available. We have sequenced and de novo-assembled the transcriptome of S. solidus using tissues from whole worms at three key developmental states - non-infective plerocercoid, infective plerocercoid and adult plerocercoid - to provide a resource for studying the evolution of complex life cycles and, more specifically, how parasites modulate their interactions with their hosts during development. Findings: The de novo transcriptome assembly reconstructed the coding sequence of 10,285 high-confidence unigenes from which 24,765 non-redundant transcripts were derived. 7,920 (77 %) of these unigenes were annotated with a protein name and 7,323 (71 %) were assigned at least one Gene Ontology term. Our raw transcriptome assembly (unfiltered transcripts) covers 92 % of the predicted transcriptome derived from the S. solidus draft genome assembly currently available on WormBase. It also provides new ecological information and orthology relationships to further annotate the current WormBase transcriptome and genome. Conclusion: This large-scale transcriptomic dataset provides a foundation for studies on how parasitic species with complex life cycles modulate their response to changes in biotic and abiotic conditions experienced inside their various hosts, which is a fundamental objective of parasitology. Furthermore, this resource will help in the validation of the S solidus gene features that have been predicted based on genomic sequence. © 2016 Hébert et al.","Animals; Cestoda; Contig Mapping; Gene Expression Profiling; Genome, Helminth; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, RNA; transcriptome; abiotic stress; biotic stress; cestode; Gasterosteus aculeatus; gene ontology; genetic code; genetic resource; genetic transcription; life cycle stage; nonhuman; Note; orthology; parasite development; priority journal; Schistocephalus solidus; sequence analysis; transcriptomics; WormBase; animal; cestode; contig mapping; gene expression profiling; genetics; genome; growth, development and aging; molecular genetics; phylogeny; procedures; sequence analysis","BioMed Central Ltd.","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991526206"

The data storage relies on MongoDB, which offers good scalability properties. Gigwa can handle multiple databases and may be deployed in either single- or multi-user mode. In addition, it provides a wide range of popular export formats. Conclusions: The Gigwa application is suitable for managing large amounts of genomic variation data.

However, although analysis of deep next-generation sequencing data allows us to identity potential pathogens, the entire analytical procedure requires competency in the bioinformatics domain, which includes implementing proper software packages and preparing prerequisite databases.

Results: This manuscript presents a pipeline, drVM (detect and reconstruct known viral genomes from metagenomes), for rapid viral read identification, genus-level read partition, read normalization, de novo assembly, sequence annotation, and coverage profiling. The first two procedures and sequence annotation rely on known viral genomes as a reference database. drVM was validated via the analysis of over 300 sequencing runs generated by Illumina and Ion Torrent platforms to provide complete viral genome assemblies for a variety of virus types including DNA viruses, RNA viruses, and retroviruses. drVM is available for free download at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/sb2nhri/files/drVM/and is also assembled as a Docker container, an Amazon machine image, and a virtual machine to facilitate seamless deployment. Conclusions: drVM was compared with other viral detection tools to demonstrate its merits in terms of viral genome completeness and reduced computation time.

To realize the potential of this platform, a number of groups are developing bioinformatics tools tuned for the unique characteristics of its data. We note that these development efforts would benefit from a simulator software, the output of which could be used to benchmark analysis tools. Results: Here, we introduce NanoSim, a fast and scalable read simulator that captures the technology-specific features of ONT data and allows for adjustments upon improvement of nanopore sequencing technology. The first step of NanoSim is read characterization, which provides a comprehensive alignment-based analysis and generates a set of read profiles serving as the input to the next step, the simulation stage. The simulation stage uses the model built in the previous step to produce in silico reads for a given reference genome. NanoSim is written in Python and R. The source files and manual are available at the Genome Sciences Centre website: http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/nanosim. Conclusion: In this work, we model the base-calling errors of ONT reads to inform the simulation of sequences with similar characteristics. We showcase the performance of NanoSim on publicly available datasets generated using the R7 and R7.3 chemistries and different sequencing kits and compare the resulting synthetic reads to those of other long-sequence simulators and experimental ONT reads.

Vegetation is dominated by annual grasses, and shrubs such as Mormon tea (Ephedra californica), which is of relevance to our target species, the federally listed blunt-nosed leopard lizard, and likely also provides key ecosystem services. We used relatively nonintrusive camera traps, or trail cameras, to capture interactions between animals and these shrubs using a paired shrub-open deployment. Cameras were placed within the shrub understory and in open microhabitats at ground level to estimate animal activity and determine species presence. Findings: Twenty cameras were deployed from April 1st, 2015 to July 5th, 2015 at paired shrub-open microsites at three locations. Over 425,000 pictures were taken during this time, of which 0.4 % detected mammals, birds, insects, and reptiles including the blunt-nosed leopard lizard. Trigger rate was very high on the medium sensitivity camera setting in this desert ecosystem, and rates did not differ between microsites. Conclusions: Camera traps are an effective, less invasive survey method for collecting data on the presence or absence of desert animals in shrub and open microhabitats. A more extensive array of cameras within an arid region would thus be an effective tool to estimate the presence of desert animals and potentially detect habitat use patterns. © 2016 The Author(s).","Ammospermophilus nelson; Article; bird; camera; controlled study; coyote; ecosystem; endangered species; Ephedra; Ephedra californica; facilitation; Gambelia sila; grass; hare; imagery; insect; Lepus californicus; lizard; microhabitat; nonhuman; reptile; Sciuridae; shrub; United States; vegetation","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016065212"

Applying INC-Seq for 16S rRNA-based bacterial profiling generated full-length amplicon sequences with a median accuracy > 97 %. Conclusions: INC-Seq reads enabled accurate species-level classification, identification of species at 0.1 % abundance and robust quantification of relative abundances, providing a cheap and effective approach for pathogen detection and microbiome profiling on the MinION system. © 2016 The Author(s).","Algorithms; Bacteria; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Nanopores; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; bacterial DNA; genomic DNA; RNA 16S; bacterial DNA; ribosome DNA; RNA 16S; accuracy; amplicon; Article; bacterium identification; chimeraplasty; consensus sequence; data base; DNA template; gene amplification; gene mapping; genomics; haplotype; intramolecular ligated nanopore consensus sequencing; microbiome; nanopore; nonhuman; priority journal; RNA sequence; sequence analysis; Streptococcus; algorithm; bacterium; classification; DNA barcoding; DNA sequence; genetics; high throughput sequencing; human; nanopore; procedures","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007313404"

Its transition from a swimming to a crawling method of movement during early development, anadromous migration during growth, and catadromous migration during breeding have been attractive features for research. However, knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate these processes is still very limited. Findings: A total of 258.8 gigabases (Gb) of raw reads from whole-genome sequencing of the crab were generated by the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. The final genome assembly (1.12 Gb), about 67.5 % of the estimated genome size (1.66 Gb), is composed of 17,553 scaffolds (>2 kb) with an N50 of 224 kb. We identified 14,436 genes using AUGUSTUS, of which 7,549 were shown to have significant supporting evidence using the GLEAN pipeline. This gene number is much greater than that of the horseshoe crab, and the annotation completeness, as evaluated by CEGMA, reached 66.9 %. Conclusions: We report the first genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation of the Chinese mitten crab. The assembled draft genome will provide a valuable resource for the study of essential developmental processes and genetic determination of important traits of the Chinese mitten crab, and also for investigating crustacean evolution. © 2016 Song et al.","Animals; Brachyura; China; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Genome; Genomics; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Sequence Analysis, DNA; genomic DNA; China; Eriocheir sinensis; female; gene number; gene sequence; genome; genome size; horseshoe crab; nonhuman; Note; priority journal; animal; Brachyura; DNA sequence; genetics; genome; genomics; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; procedures","BioMed Central Ltd.","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006198839"

Since some electrophysiological studies suggest differences between children with/without motor development problems, we prepared an experimental protocol and performed electrophysiological experiments with the aim of making a step toward a possible diagnosis of this disorder using the event-related potentials (ERP) technique. The second aim is to properly annotate the obtained raw data with relevant metadata and promote their long-term sustainability. Results: The data from 32 school children (16 with possible DCD and 16 in the control group) were collected. Each dataset contains raw electroencephalography (EEG) data in the BrainVision format and provides sufficient metadata (such as age, gender, results of the motor test, and hearing thresholds) to allow other researchers to perform analysis. For each experiment, the percentage of ERP trials damaged by blinking artifacts was estimated. Furthermore, ERP trials were averaged across different participants and conditions, and the resulting plots are included in the manuscript. This should help researchers to estimate the usability of individual datasets for analysis. Conclusions: The aim of the whole project is to find out if it is possible to make any conclusions about DCD from EEG data obtained. For the purpose of further analysis, the data were collected and annotated respecting the current outcomes of the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility Program on Standards for Data Sharing, the Task Force on Electrophysiology, and the group developing the Ontology for Experimental Neurophysiology. The data with metadata are stored in the EEG/ERP Portal. © The Author 2017.","Acoustic Stimulation; Child; Comorbidity; Computer Simulation; Data Curation; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Male; Motor Skills Disorders; Photic Stimulation; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Reaction Time; Reproducibility of Results; Software; auditory threshold; child; child health; clinical article; comorbidity; developmental coordination disorder; electroencephalography; event related potential; experimental study; eyelid reflex; female; hearing impairment; human; male; motor performance; Note; priority journal; reaction time; school child; auditory stimulation; computer simulation; evoked response; information processing; photostimulation; psychomotor disorder; quantitative trait; reproducibility; software","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023177980"

To achieve its full potential, including the integration of multiple omics modalities, the accessibility, standardization and reproducibility of computational metabolomics tools must be improved significantly. Results: Here we present our end-to-end mass spectrometry metabolomics workflow in the widely used platform, Galaxy. Named Galaxy-M, our workflow has been developed for both direct infusion mass spectrometry (DIMS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics. The range of tools presented spans from processing of raw data, e.g. peak picking and alignment, through data cleansing, e.g. missing value imputation, to preparation for statistical analysis, e.g. normalization and scaling, and principal components analysis (PCA) with associated statistical evaluation. We demonstrate the ease of using these Galaxy workflows via the analysis of DIMS and LC-MS datasets, and provide PCA scores and associated statistics to help other users to ensure that they can accurately repeat the processing and analysis of these two datasets. Galaxy and data are all provided pre-installed in a virtual machine (VM) that can be downloaded from the GigaDB repository. Additionally, source code, executables and installation instructions are available from GitHub. Conclusions: The Galaxy platform has enabled us to produce an easily accessible and reproducible computational metabolomics workflow. More tools could be added by the community to expand its functionality. We recommend that Galaxy-M workflow files are included within the supplementary information of publications, enabling metabolomics studies to achieve greater reproducibility. © 2016 Davidson et al.","Chromatography, Liquid; Computational Biology; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Workflow; accuracy; calibration; data analysis; lipidomics; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; metabolite; metabolomics; Note; principal component analysis; priority journal; reproducibility; workflow; biology; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; metabolome; metabolomics; procedures; software; workflow","BioMed Central Ltd.","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991526698"

These incomplete and fragmented assemblies lead to errors in gene identification, such that single genes spread across multiple contigs are annotated as separate gene models. Such biases can confound inferences about the number and identity of genes within species, as well as gene gain and loss between species. Results: We present AGOUTI (Annotated Genome Optimization Using Transcriptome Information), a tool that uses RNA sequencing data to simultaneously combine contigs into scaffolds and fragmented gene models into single models. We show that AGOUTI improves both the contiguity of genome assemblies and the accuracy of gene annotation, providing updated versions of each as output. Running AGOUTI on both simulated and real datasets, we show that it is highly accurate and that it achieves greater accuracy and contiguity when compared with other existing methods. Conclusion: AGOUTI is a powerful and effective scaffolder and, unlike most scaffolders, is expected to be more effective in larger genomes because of the commensurate increase in intron length. AGOUTI is able to scaffold thousands of contigs while simultaneously reducing the number of gene models by hundreds or thousands.

Optical mapping provides long-range information of the genome and can more easily identify large structural variations. The ability of optical mapping to assay long single DNA molecules nicely complements short-read sequencing which is more suitable for the identification of small and short-range variants. Direct use of optical mapping to study population-level genetic diversity is currently limited to microbial strain typing and human diversity studies.

In a flocking model, individual agents respond only to their immediate environment and move according to a few simple rules. After several iterations the agents self-organize, and clusters emerge without the need for partitional seeds. In addition to its unsupervised nature, flocking offers several computational advantages, including the potential to reduce the number of required comparisons. Findings: In the tool presented here, Clusterflock, we have implemented a flocking algorithm designed to locate groups (flocks) of orthologous gene families (OGFs) that share an evolutionary history. Pairwise distances that measure phylogenetic incongruence between OGFs guide flock formation. We tested this approach on several simulated datasets by varying the number of underlying topologies, the proportion of missing data, and evolutionary rates, and show that in datasets containing high levels of missing data and rate heterogeneity, Clusterflock outperforms other well-established clustering techniques. We also verified its utility on a known, large-scale recombination event in Staphylococcus aureus. By isolating sets of OGFs with divergent phylogenetic signals, we were able to pinpoint the recombined region without forcing a pre-determined number of groupings or defining a pre-determined incongruence threshold. Conclusions: Clusterflock is an open-source tool that can be used to discover horizontally transferred genes, recombined areas of chromosomes, and the phylogenetic 'core' of a genome. Although we used it here in an evolutionary context, it is generalizable to any clustering problem. Users can write extensions to calculate any distance metric on the unit interval, and can use these distances to 'flock' any type of data. © The Author(s).","Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Evolution, Molecular; Genes, Bacterial; Genomics; Phylogeny; Recombination, Genetic; Staphylococcus aureus; animal behavior; Article; chromosome; clusterflock; comparative study; DNA microarray; gene cluster; genetic algorithm; genetic heterogeneity; genetic recombination; genome; horizontal gene transfer; information processing; molecular phylogeny; multigene family; nonhuman; phylogenomics; signal transduction; Staphylococcus aureus; algorithm; bacterial gene; classification; cluster analysis; genetics; genomics; molecular evolution; phylogeny; procedures","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016082139"

There are several different types of data sharing which can be considered to fall along a spectrum, ranging from simpler and less informative to more complex and more informative. In this paper we consider this spectrum for three domains: data capture, data density, and data analysis. Here the focus is on the right end of the spectrum, that is, how to maximize the information content while addressing the challenges. A summary of associated challenges of and possible solutions is presented in this review and includes: 1) a discussion of tools to monitor quality of data as it is collected and encourage adoption of data mapping standards; 2) sharing of time-series data (not just summary maps or regions); and 3) the use of analytic approaches which maximize sharing potential as much as possible. Examples of existing solutions for each of these points, which we developed in our lab, are also discussed including the use of a comprehensive beginning-to-end neuroinformatics platform and the use of flexible analytic approaches, such as independent component analysis and multivariate classification approaches, such as deep learning. © 2015 Calhoun.","Brain; Humans; Information Dissemination; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Software; access to information; data analysis; data mining; functional magnetic resonance imaging; independent component analysis; information processing; information storage; multivariate analysis; neuroimaging; priority journal; privacy; Review; brain; human; information dissemination; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; software","BioMed Central Ltd.","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945497747"

The model of genetic hitchhiking predicts that strong positive selection affects the patterns of linkage disequilibrium around the site of a beneficial allele, resulting in specific motifs of correlation between neutral polymorphisms that surround the fixed beneficial allele. Increased levels of linkage disequilibrium are observed on the same side of a beneficial allele, and diminish between sites on different sides of a beneficial mutation. This specific pattern of linkage disequilibrium occurs more frequently when positive selection has acted on the population rather than under various neutral models. Thus, detecting such patterns could accurately reveal targets of positive selection along a recombining chromosome or a genome. Calculating linkage disequilibria in whole genomes is computationally expensive because allele correlations need to be evaluated for millions of pairs of sites. To analyze large datasets efficiently, algorithmic implementations used in modern population genetics need to exploit multiple cores of current workstations in a scalable way. However, population genomic datasets come in various types and shapes while typically showing SNP density heterogeneity, which makes the implementation of generally scalable parallel algorithms a challenging task. Findings: Here we present a series of four parallelization strategies targeting shared-memory systems for the computationally intensive problem of detecting genomic regions that have contributed to the past adaptation of the species, also referred to as regions that have undergone a selective sweep, based on linkage disequilibrium patterns. We provide a thorough performance evaluation of the proposed parallel algorithms for computing linkage disequilibrium, and outline the benefits of each approach. Furthermore, we compare the accuracy of our open-source sweep-detection software OmegaPlus, which implements all four parallelization strategies presented here, with a variety of neutrality tests. Conclusions: The computational demands of selective sweep detection algorithms depend greatly on the SNP density heterogeneity and the data representation. Choosing the right parallel algorithm for the analysis can lead to significant processing time reduction and major energy savings. However, determining which parallel algorithm will execute more efficiently on a specific processor architecture and number of available cores for a particular dataset is not straightforward. © 2016 Alachiotis and Pavlidis.","Algorithms; Alleles; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Genome, Human; Genotype; Humans; Linkage Disequilibrium; Models, Genetic; Mutation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Reproducibility of Results; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA; chromosome 1; coarse grained algorithm; computer program; correlation coefficient; energy conservation; evolutionary adaptation; gene linkage disequilibrium; generic parallelization; genetic algorithm; genetic heterogeneity; human; mathematical model; multi-grained algorithm; neutrality test; Note; parallel algorithm; parallelization strategy; population genetics; priority journal; process optimization; scalable parallel algorithm; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; shared memory system; simulation; single nucleotide polymorphism; statistics; sweep detection algorithm; algorithm; allele; biological model; biology; computer simulation; DNA sequence; gene frequency; genetic selection; genetics; genotype; human genome; mutation; population genetics; procedures; reproducibility","BioMed Central Ltd.","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006190448"

These paradigms are drawing excitement due to their greater tolerability in clinical and developing populations and because they enable a wider range of analyses (e.g., inter-subject correlations). To be clinically useful, the test-retest reliability of connectivity measured during these paradigms needs to be established. This resource provides data for evaluating test-retest reliability for full-brain connectivity patterns detected during each of four scan conditions that differ with respect to level of engagement (rest, abstract animations, movie clips, flanker task). Data are provided for 13 participants, each scanned in 12 sessions with 10 minutes for each scan of the four conditions. Diffusion kurtosis imaging data was also obtained at each session. Findings: Technical validation and demonstrative reliability analyses were carried out at the connection-level using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient and at network-level representations of the data using the Image Intraclass Correlation Coefficient. Variation in intrinsic functional connectivity across sessions was generally found to be greater than that attributable to scan condition. Between-condition reliability was generally high, particularly for the frontoparietal and default networks. Between-session reliabilities obtained separately for the different scan conditions were comparable, though notably lower than between-condition reliabilities. Conclusions: This resource provides a test-bed for quantifying the reliability of connectivity indices across subjects, conditions and time. The resource can be used to compare and optimize different frameworks for measuring connectivity and data collection parameters such as scan length. Additionally, investigators can explore the unique perspectives of the brain's functional architecture offered by each of the scan conditions. © The Author 2017.","Adolescent; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cluster Analysis; Connectome; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Individuality; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Surveys and Questionnaires; Web Browser; Young Adult; adult; connectome; dorsal attention network; female; frontoparietal cortex; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; limbic cortex; male; neuroimaging; Note; phenotype; priority journal; quality control; test retest reliability; validation study; ventral attention network; visual cortex; adolescent; brain; brain mapping; cluster analysis; computer assisted diagnosis; connectome; image processing; individuality; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; questionnaire; reproducibility; software; three dimensional imaging; web browser; young adult","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021859950"

Based on the high-density bin map, we updated Zhanggu reference with 416 Mb after adding 16 Mb unanchored scaffolds and Yugu reference with some assembly error correction and 3158 gaps filled. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of nine agronomic traits was done based on this RIL population, five of which were controlled by a single gene. Meanwhile, two QTLs were found for plant height, and a candidate gene showed 89% identity to the known rice gibberellin-synthesis gene sd1. Three QTLs were found for the trait of heading date. The whole genome resequencing and QTL mapping provided important tools for foxtail millet research and breeding.

Despite the cornucopia of high-throughput (HTP) phosphoproteomic data in the last decade, it remains unclear how many proteins are phosphorylated and how many phosphorylation sites (p-sites) can exist in total within a eukaryotic proteome. We present the first reliable estimates of the total number of phosphoproteins and p-sites for four eukaryotes (human, mouse, Arabidopsis, and yeast). Results: In all, 187 HTP phosphoproteomic datasets were filtered, compiled, and studied along with two low-throughput (LTP) compendia. Estimates of the number of phosphoproteins and p-sites were inferred by two methods: Capture-Recapture, and fitting the saturation curve of cumulative redundant vs. cumulative non-redundant phosphoproteins/p-sites. Estimates were also adjusted for different levels of noise within the individual datasets and other confounding factors. We estimate that in total, 13 000, 11 000, and 3000 phosphoproteins and 230 000, 156 000, and 40 000 p-sites exist in human, mouse, and yeast, respectively, whereas estimates for Arabidopsis were not as reliable. Conclusions: Most of the phosphoproteins have been discovered for human, mouse, and yeast, while the dataset for Arabidopsis is still far from complete. The datasets for p-sites are not as close to saturation as those for phosphoproteins. Integration of the LTP data suggests that current HTP phosphoproteomics appears to be capable of capturing 70% to 95% of total phosphoproteins, but only 40% to 60% of total p-sites. © The Author 2017.","Animals; Arabidopsis; Eukaryotic Cells; Humans; Mice; Phosphoproteins; Phosphorylation; Proteome; Proteomics; Reproducibility of Results; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; phosphoprotein; proteome; phosphoprotein; proteome; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; binding site; human; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; proteomics; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; animal; Arabidopsis; chemistry; eukaryotic cell; meta analysis; metabolism; mouse; phosphorylation; procedures; proteomics; reproducibility","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017265345"

However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for faster and scalable implementations of key functions, such as logistic regression, linkage disequilibrium estimation, and genomic distance evaluation. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain genotype likelihoods, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format. Findings: To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, O(√n)-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have also developed an extension to the data format which adds low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase, multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which is the basis of our planned second release (PLINK 2.0). Conclusions: The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use. © 2015 Chang et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Algorithms; Computational Biology; Datasets as Topic; Genetics, Population; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotyping Techniques; Likelihood Functions; Linkage Disequilibrium; Logistic Models; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Software; algorithm; allele; Article; cluster analysis; controlled study; data analysis software; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic variability; genome analysis; haplotype; heterozygote; homozygote; linkage analysis; mathematical model; phenotype; priority journal; process development; validation process; biology; genome-wide association study; genotyping technique; information processing; population genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; software; statistical model","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930213392"

With the creation of data organization structures and tools that drastically improve code portability, we now have the opportunity to design such a framework for communicating extensible scientific discoveries. Our proposed solution leverages these existing technologies and standards, and provides an accessible and extensible model for reproducible research, called 'science in the cloud' (SIC). Exploiting scientific containers, cloud computing, and cloud data services, we show the capability to compute in the cloud and run a web service that enables intimate interaction with the tools and data presented.

We compared μCT-based images of a recently described land planarian species of Obama otavioi (Platyhelminthes) with those obtained from light microphotography of histological sections, most of which were also digitized at high magnification. Findings: The specimens studied were collected in 2012. Subsequent μCT-based images of the stained body of a paratype show nearly all morphological features provided by traditional histology, with the exception of particularly minute structures, smaller than 5 μm, such as the sensory pits and single muscle fibers, which are best visible on traditional histological sections. Because the technique is non-destructive, the scanned specimen is preserved without damage. The raw and derivative μCT data and virtual histological sections are freely available in GigaDB. Conclusions: The μCT datasets of these stained soft-bodied organisms reveal images of external and internal structures that support previous taxonomic studies. This technique can be particularly important for non-destructively revealing internal details of whole museum specimens at a faster rate than histology alone. High-resolution virtual histological slides also allow further searches for new, previously unstudied morphological features. The use of X-ray equipment with higher resolution can enable smaller sensory organ and muscle fiber details to be seen. The image sets, μCT-based images and digitized histological slides can be disseminated without the constraints of specimen loans. © 2016 Carbayo and Lenihan.","Animals; Histological Techniques; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Planarians; Reproducibility of Results; Software; X-Ray Microtomography; phosphotungstic acid; histology; image analysis; image processing; image quality; image reconstruction; micro-computed tomography; microphotography; muscle cell; nonhuman; Note; platyhelminth; priority journal; taxonomy; anatomy and histology; animal; micro-computed tomography; procedures; reproducibility; software; three dimensional imaging; Turbellaria","BioMed Central Ltd.","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991528491"

Despite its pest status, little is known about the molecular mechanisms responsible for much of the biology of this species. Earlier Lygus transcriptome assemblies were limited by low read depth, or because they focused on specific conditions. To generate a more comprehensive transcriptome, we supplemented previous datasets with new reads corresponding to specific tissues (heads, antennae, and male reproductive tissues). This transcriptome augments current Lygus molecular resources and provides the foundational knowledge critical for future comparative studies. Findings: An expanded, Trinity-based de novo transcriptome assembly for L. hesperus was generated using previously published whole body Illumina data, supplemented with 293 million bp of new raw sequencing data corresponding to five tissue-specific cDNA libraries and 11 Illumina sequencing runs. The updated transcriptome consists of 22,022 transcripts (average length of 2075 nt), 62 % of which contain complete open reading frames. Significant coverage of the BUSCO (benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs) dataset and robust metrics indicate that the transcriptome is a quality assembly with a high degree of completeness. Initial assessment of the new assembly's utility revealed that the length and abundance of transcripts predicted to regulate insect physiology and chemosensation have improved, compared with previous L. hesperus assemblies. Conclusions: This transcriptome represents a significant expansion of Lygus transcriptome data, and improves foundational knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying L. hesperus biology.

The molecular bases underlying the phenotypic differences among domesticated cultivars, or between domesticated olive trees and their wild relatives, remain poorly understood. Both wild and cultivated olive trees have 46 chromosomes (2n). Findings: A total of 543 Gb of raw DNA sequence from whole genome shotgun sequencing, and a fosmid library containing 155,000 clones from a 1,000+ year-old olive tree (cv. Farga) were generated by Illumina sequencing using different combinations of mate-pair and pair-end libraries. Assembly gave a final genome with a scaffold N50 of 443 kb, and a total length of 1.31 Gb, which represents 95 % of the estimated genome length (1.38 Gb). In addition, the associated fungus Aureobasidium pullulans was partially sequenced. Genome annotation, assisted by RNA sequencing from leaf, root, and fruit tissues at various stages, resulted in 56,349 unique protein coding genes, suggesting recent genomic expansion. Genome completeness, as estimated using the CEGMA pipeline, reached 98.79 %. Conclusions: The assembled draft genome of O. europaea will provide a valuable resource for the study of the evolution and domestication processes of this important tree, and allow determination of the genetic bases of key phenotypic traits. Moreover, it will enhance breeding programs and the formation of new varieties. © 2016 The Author(s).","Chromosome Mapping; Contig Mapping; Gene Library; Genome Size; Genome, Plant; Mediterranean Region; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Olea; Sequence Analysis, DNA; untranslated RNA; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; Aureobasidium pullulans; contig mapping; cultivar; DNA sequence; expressed sequence tag; flower; fruit; gene mapping; gene sequence; genome size; homozygosity; molecular genetics; nonhuman; olive tree; phenotypic variation; plant genetics; plant leaf; plant root; plant seed; plant stem; plastid; priority journal; protein analysis; Ricinus communis; tomato; chromosomal mapping; gene library; genetics; olive tree; plant genome; procedures; Southern Europe","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006192475"

Annotation of repetitive elements and coding regions resulted in 265.0 Mb TEs (40.3%) and 20 786 protein-coding genes with putative gene family expansions, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on orthologs across 14 arthropod taxa suggested that MED/Q is clustered into a hemipteran clade containing A. pisum and is a sister lineage to a clade containing both R. prolixus and N. lugens. Genome completeness, as estimated using the CEGMA and Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs pipelines, reached 96% and 79%. These MED/Q genomic resources lay a foundation for future 'pan-genomic' comparisons of invasive vs. noninvasive, invasive vs. invasive, and native vs. exotic Bemisia, which, in return, will open up new avenues of investigation into whitefly biology, evolution, and management. © The Author 2017.

Geometric remodeling indices have been shown to have prognostic value in predicting adverse events in the clinical literature, but these often describe interrelated shape changes. We developed a novel method for deriving orthogonal remodeling components directly from any (moderately independent) set of clinical remodeling indices. Results: Six clinical remodeling indices (end-diastolic volume index, sphericity, relative wall thickness, ejection fraction, apical conicity, and longitudinal shortening) were evaluated using cardiac magnetic resonance images of 300 patients with myocardial infarction, and 1991 asymptomatic subjects, obtained from the Cardiac Atlas Project. Partial least squares (PLS) regression of left ventricular shape models resulted in remodeling components that were optimally associated with each remodeling index. A Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process, by which remodeling components were successively removed from the shape space in the order of shape variance explained, resulted in a set of orthonormal remodeling components. Remodeling scores could then be calculated that quantify the amount of each remodeling component present in each case. A one-factor PLS regression led to more decoupling between scores from the different remodeling components across the entire cohort, and zero correlation between clinical indices and subsequent scores. Conclusions: The PLS orthogonal remodeling components had similar power to describe differences between myocardial infarction patients and asymptomatic subjects as principal component analysis, but were better associated with well-understood clinical indices of cardiac remodeling.

Recent reports have tested the ability of the MinION™ to act as a whole genome sequencer and have demonstrated that nanopore sequencing has tremendous potential utility. However, the current nanopore technology still has limitations with respect to error-rate, and this is problematic when attempting to assemble whole genomes without secondary rounds of sequencing to correct errors. In this study, we tested the ability of the MinION™ nanopore sequencer to accurately identify and differentiate bacterial and viral samples via directed sequencing of characteristic genes shared broadly across a target clade.Results: Using a 6 hour sequencing run time, sufficient data were generated to identify an E. coli sample down to the species level from 16S rDNA amplicons. Three poxviruses (cowpox, vaccinia-MVA, and vaccinia-Lister) were identified and differentiated down to the strain level, despite over 98% identity between the vaccinia strains. The ability to differentiate strains by amplicon sequencing on the MinION™ was accomplished despite an observed per-base error rate of approximately 30%.Conclusions: While nanopore sequencing, using the MinION™ platform from Oxford Nanopore in particular, continues to mature into a commercially available technology, practical uses are sought for the current versions of the technology. This study offers evidence of the utility of amplicon sequencing by demonstrating that the current versions of MinION™ technology can accurately identify and differentiate both viral and bacterial species present within biological samples via amplicon sequencing. © 2015 Kilianski et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Bacteria; Classification; Nanopores; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Viruses; DNA 16S; amplicon; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium identification; cladistics; controlled study; Cowpox virus; diagnostic accuracy; DNA sequence; error; Escherichia coli; gene sequence; gene technology; genetic procedures; laboratory device; nanopore sequencer; nanopore sequencing; nonhuman; Poxviridae; priority journal; Vaccinia virus; virus identification; virus strain; bacterium; classification; genetics; nanopore; procedures; virus","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938850442"

When those steps have been described in sufficient detail that others can retrace the steps and obtain similar results, the research is said to be reproducible. Computers play a vital role in many research disciplines and present both opportunities and challenges for reproducibility. Computers can be programmed to execute analysis tasks, and those programs can be repeated and shared with others. The deterministic nature of most computer programs means that the same analysis tasks, applied to the same data, will often produce the same outputs. However, in practice, computational findings often cannot be reproduced because of complexities in how software is packaged, installed, and executed-and because of limitations associated with how scientists document analysis steps. Many tools and techniques are available to help overcome these challenges; here we describe seven such strategies. With a broad scientific audience in mind, we describe the strengths and limitations of each approach, as well as the circumstances under which each might be applied. No single strategy is sufficient for every scenario; thus we emphasize that it is often useful to combine approaches. © 2016 The Author(s).","Computational Biology; Reproducibility of Results; Research Design; Software; calculation; computer interface; computer program; information processing; information retrieval; mathematical analysis; priority journal; reproducibility; research; Review; validity; biology; methodology; procedures; software","BioMed Central Ltd.","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991529234"

Identifying genes involved in synthesis of bioactive compounds could enable the breeding of berry varieties with enhanced health benefits.Results: Toward this end, we annotated a previously sequenced draft blueberry genome assembly using RNA-Seq data from five stages of berry fruit development and ripening. Genome-guided assembly of RNA-Seq read alignments combined with output from ab initio gene finders produced around 60,000 gene models, of which more than half were similar to proteins from other species, typically the grape Vitis vinifera. Comparison of gene models to the PlantCyc database of metabolic pathway enzymes identified candidate genes involved in synthesis of bioactive compounds, including bixin, an apocarotenoid with potential disease-fighting properties, and defense-related cyanogenic glycosides, which are toxic. Cyanogenic glycoside (CG) biosynthetic enzymes were highly expressed in green fruit, and a candidate CG detoxification enzyme was up-regulated during fruit ripening. Candidate genes for ethylene, anthocyanin, and 400 other biosynthetic pathways were also identified. Homology-based annotation using Blast2GO and InterPro assigned Gene Ontology terms to around 15,000 genes. RNA-Seq expression profiling showed that blueberry growth, maturation, and ripening involve dynamic gene expression changes, including coordinated up- and down-regulation of metabolic pathway enzymes and transcriptional regulators. Analysis of RNA-seq alignments identified developmentally regulated alternative splicing, promoter use, and 3' end formation.Conclusions: We report genome sequence, gene models, functional annotations, and RNA-Seq expression data that provide an important new resource enabling high throughput studies in blueberry. © 2015 Gupta et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Alternative Splicing; Anthocyanins; Base Sequence; Biosynthetic Pathways; Blueberry Plants; Databases, Genetic; Ethylenes; Fruit; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genome, Plant; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Annotation; RNA, Plant; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, RNA; anthocyanin; bioactive compound; bixin; cyanogenic glycoside; dhurrin; ethylene; natural products and their synthetic derivatives; plant glycoside; transcriptome; unclassified drug; anthocyanin; ethylene; ethylene derivative; plant RNA; alternative RNA splicing; Article; biosynthesis; blueberry; comparative study; controlled study; DNA flanking region; down regulation; fruit development; fruit ripening; functional annotation; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene identification; gene library; genetic database; genetic model; genetic variability; genome assembly; grape; high throughput sequencing; molecular genetics; nonhuman; open reading frame; plant genome; plant growth; priority journal; promoter region; protein database; protein expression; RNA extraction; RNA sequence; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; sequence homology; transcriptomics; upregulation; biological model; chemistry; fruit; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; plant genome; sequence analysis; Vaccinium","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939429237"

The 'Biomes of Australian Soil Environments' (BASE) project has generated a database of microbial diversity with associated metadata across extensive environmental gradients at continental scale. As the characterisation of microbes rapidly expands, the BASE database provides an evolving platform for interrogating and integrating microbial diversity and function. Findings: BASE currently provides amplicon sequences and associated contextual data for over 900 sites encompassing all Australian states and territories, a wide variety of bioregions, vegetation and land-use types. Amplicons target bacteria, archaea and general and fungal-specific eukaryotes. The growing database will soon include metagenomics data. Data are provided in both raw sequence (FASTQ) and analysed OTU table formats and are accessed via the project's data portal, which provides a user-friendly search tool to quickly identify samples of interest. Processed data can be visually interrogated and intersected with other Australian diversity and environmental data using tools developed by the 'Atlas of Living Australia'. Conclusions: Developed within an open data framework, the BASE project is the first Australian soil microbial diversity database. The database will grow and link to other global efforts to explore microbial, plant, animal, and marine biodiversity. Its design and open access nature ensures that BASE will evolve as a valuable tool for documenting an often overlooked component of biodiversity and the many microbe-driven processes that are essential to sustain soil function and ecosystem services. © 2016 Bissett et al.","Archaea; Australia; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Databases, Factual; Fungi; Metagenomics; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil Microbiology; DNA; RNA 18S; access to information; amplicon; archaeon; Australia; Biomes of Australian Soil Environments database; computer interface; controlled study; data processing; eukaryote; factual database; genetic association; land biome; land use; metagenomics; microbial diversity; nonhuman; Note; priority journal; sequence analysis; soil microflora; vegetation; bacterium; biodiversity; classification; DNA sequence; fungus; genetics; microbiology; phylogeny; procedures","BioMed Central Ltd.","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991529237"

Here we report the first demonstration of single contig genome assembly using Oxford Nanopore native barcoding when applied to a multiplexed library of 12 samples and combined with existing Illumina short read data. This paves the way for the closure of multiple bacterial genomes from a single MinION(TM) sequencing run, given the availability of existing short read data. The strain we used, MHO 001, represents the important community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus lineage USA300. Findings: Using a hybrid assembly of existing short read and barcoded long read sequences from multiplexed data, we completed a genome of the S. aureus USA300 strain MHO 001. The long read data represented only ~5% to 10% of an average MinION(TM) run (~7x genomic coverage), but, using standard tools, this was sufficient to complete the circular chromosome of S. aureus strain MHO 001 (2.86 Mb) and two complete plasmids (27 Kb and 3 Kb). Minor differences were noted when compared to USA300 reference genome, USA300 FPR3757, including the translocation, loss, and gain of mobile genetic elements. Conclusion: Here we demonstrate that MinION(TM) reads, multiplexed using native barcoding, can be used in combination with short read data to fully complete a bacterial genome. The ability to complete multiple genomes, for which short read data is already available, from a single MinION(TM) run is set to impact our understanding of accessory genome content, plasmid diversity, and genome rearrangements. © The Author 2017.","DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; DNA, Bacterial; Genome, Bacterial; Genomic Library; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Nanopores; Reproducibility of Results; Species Specificity; bacterial DNA; bacterial chromosome; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; bacterial strain; DNA barcoding; gene loss; gene sequence; gene translocation; genetic parameters; genome assembly; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; nanopore; nonhuman; Note; priority journal; classification; DNA barcoding; gene library; genetics; genomics; high throughput sequencing; procedures; reproducibility; species difference","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023167536"

Scabies infections are a major health problem, particularly in remote Indigenous communities in Australia, where secondary group A streptococcal and Staphylococcus aureus infections of scabies sores are thought to drive the high rate of rheumatic heart disease and chronic kidney disease. Results: We sequenced the genome of two samples of Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis obtained from unrelated patients with crusted scabies located in different parts of northern Australia using the Illumina HiSeq. We also sequenced samples of Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis from a pig model. Because of the small size of the scabies mite, these data are derived from pools of thousands of mites and are metagenomic, including host and microbiome DNA. We performed cleaning and de novo assembly and present Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis and var. suis draft reference genomes.

This procedure can be useful for calculating brain volume and for improving the quality of other image processing steps. Developing new skull-stripping algorithms and evaluating their performance requires gold standard data from a variety of different scanners and acquisition methods. We complement existing repositories with manually corrected brain masks for 125 T1-weighted anatomical scans from the Nathan Kline Institute Enhanced Rockland Sample Neurofeedback Study. Findings: Skull-stripped images were obtained using a semi-automated procedure that involved skull-stripping the data using the brain extraction based on nonlocal segmentation technique (BEaST) software, and manually correcting the worst results. Corrected brain masks were added into the BEaST library and the procedure was repeated until acceptable brain masks were available for all images. In total, 85 of the skull-stripped images were hand-edited and 40 were deemed to not need editing. The results are brain masks for the 125 images along with a BEaST library for automatically skull-stripping other data. Conclusion: Skull-stripped anatomical images from the Neurofeedback sample are available for download from the Preprocessed Connectomes Project. The resulting brain masks can be used by researchers to improve preprocessing of the Neurofeedback data, as training and testing data for developing new skull-stripping algorithms, and for evaluating the impact on other aspects of MRI preprocessing. We have illustrated the utility of these data as a reference for comparing various automatic methods and evaluated the performance of the newly created library on independent data. © 2016 The Author(s).","Adult; Algorithms; Brain; Connectome; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Skull; Software; Young Adult; algorithm; Article; brain size; connectome; human; image processing; image segmentation; neurofeedback; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; skull stripping; adult; anatomy and histology; brain; connectome; female; image processing; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; skull; software; three dimensional imaging; young adult","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016018533"

This technology has demonstrated great potential, especially in genome-wide analyses. In this study, we tested the ability of the MinION™ system to perform amplicon sequencing in order to design new approaches to study microbial diversity using nearly full-length 16S rDNA sequences. Results: Using R7.3 chemistry, we generated more than 3.8 million events (nt) during a single sequencing run. These data were sufficient to reconstruct more than 90 % of the 16S rRNA gene sequences for 20 different species present in a mock reference community. After read mapping and 16S rRNA gene assembly, consensus sequences and 2d reads were recovered to assign taxonomic classification down to the species level. Additionally, we were able to measure the relative abundance of all the species present in a mock community and detected a biased species distribution originating from the PCR reaction using 'universal' primers. Conclusions: Although nanopore-based sequencing produces reads with lower per-base accuracy compared with other platforms, the MinION™ DNA sequencer is valuable for both high taxonomic resolution and microbial diversity analysis. Improvements in nanopore chemistry, such as minimising base-calling errors and the nucleotide bias reported here for 16S amplicon sequencing, will further deliver more reliable information that is useful for the specific detection of microbial species and strains in complex ecosystems. © 2016 Benítez-Páez et al.","Bacteria; Bacterial Typing Techniques; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Nanopores; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Reproducibility of Results; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity; RNA 16S; bacterial DNA; ribosome DNA; RNA 16S; 16S rRNA gene; accuracy; amplicon; Article; consensus sequence; controlled study; gene sequence; genetic analyzer; intermethod comparison; microbial diversity; nanopore; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; population abundance; priority journal; sequence analysis; species distribution; bacterium; bacterium identification; chemistry; classification; DNA sequence; genetics; nanopore; nucleic acid amplification; procedures; reproducibility; species difference","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006184217"

Owing to its evolutionary position and four peculiar phenomenon of life (longevity, starvation tolerance, regenerative ability, and hatch without sunshine), it is an invaluable model species for research. However, lack of genomic resources leads to fewer study progresses in these fields, due to its huge genome of ~50 GB making it extremely difficult to be assembled. Results: We reported the sequenced transcriptome of more than 20 tissues from adult CGS using Illumina Hiseq 2000 technology, and a total of 93 366 no-redundancy transcripts with a mean length of 1326 bp were obtained. We developed for the first time an efficient pipeline to construct a high-quality reference gene set of CGS and obtained 26 135 coding genes. BUSCO and homologous assessment showed that our assembly captured 70.6% of vertebrate universal single-copy orthologs, and this coding gene set had a higher proportion of completeness CDS with comparable quality of the protein sets of Tibetan frog. Conclusions: These highest quality data will provide a valuable reference gene set to the subsequent research of CGS.

Underlying this diversity in leaf shape are profound changes in the patterning of the primary vasculature and laminar outgrowth. Each of these aspects of leaf morphology-vasculature and blade-provides different insights into leaf patterning. Results: Here, we morphometrically analyze 3300 leaves from 40 different Passiflora species collected sequentially across the vine. Each leaf is measured in two different ways: using 1) 15 homologous Procrustes-adjusted landmarks of the vasculature, sinuses, and lobes; and 2) Elliptical Fourier Descriptors (EFDs), which quantify the outline of the leaf. The ability of landmarks, EFDs, and both datasets together are compared to determine their relative ability to predict species and node position within the vine. Pairwise correlation of x and y landmark coordinates and EFD harmonic coefficients reveals close associations between traits and insights into the relationship between vasculature and blade patterning. Conclusions: Landmarks, more reflective of the vasculature, and EFDs, more reflective of the blade contour, describe both similar and distinct features of leaf morphology. Landmarks and EFDs vary in ability to predict species identity and node position in the vine and exhibit a correlational structure (both within landmark or EFD traits and between the two data types) revealing constraints between vascular and blade patterning underlying natural variation in leaf morphology among Passiflora species. © The Author 2017.

The underlying hypotheses of the KS test are intrinsically incompatible with this approach and the test can produce false positives supported by extremely low p-values. This potentially makes the signed KS test a tool of p-hacking, which should be discouraged by replacing it with standard tests such as the t-test and by providing confidence intervals instead of p-values. © 2015 Filion; licensee BioMed Central.","Data Interpretation, Statistical; Genomics; Reproducibility of Results; Statistics, Nonparametric; confidence interval; false positive result; intermethod comparison; Kolmogorov Smirnov test; Note; priority journal; rank sum test; statistical distribution; statistical significance; Student t test; validation process; genomics; nonparametric test; procedures; reproducibility; statistical analysis","BioMed Central Ltd.","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945497687"

Both of these approaches are limited, however, by read length, among other technical and biological factors. A nanopore-based sequencing platform, MinIONTM, produces reads that are ≥ 1 × 104 bp in length, potentially providing for more precise assignment, thereby alleviating some of the limitations inherent in determining metagenome composition from short reads. We tested the ability of sequence data produced by MinION (R7.3 flow cells) to correctly assign taxonomy in single bacterial species runs and in three types of low-complexity synthetic communities: a mixture of DNA using equal mass from four species, a community with one relatively rare (1%) and three abundant (33% each) components, and a mixture of genomic DNA from 20 bacterial strains of staggered representation. Taxonomic composition of the low-complexity communities was assessed by analyzing the MinION sequence data with three different bioinformatic approaches: Kraken, MG-RAST, and One Codex. Results: Long read sequences generated from libraries prepared from single strains using the version 5 kit and chemistry, run on the original MinION device, yielded as few as 224 to as many as 3497 bidirectional high-quality (2D) reads with an average overall study length of 6000 bp. For the single-strain analyses, assignment of reads to the correct genus by different methods ranged from 53.1% to 99.5%, assignment to the correct species ranged from 23.9% to 99.5%, and the majority of misassigned reads were to closely related organisms. A synthetic metagenome sequenced with the same setup yielded 714 high quality 2D reads of approximately 5500 bp that were up to 98% correctly assigned to the species level. Synthetic metagenome MinION libraries generated using version 6 kit and chemistry yielded from 899 to 3497 2D reads with lengths averaging 5700 bp with up to 98% assignment accuracy at the species level. The observed community proportions for ""equal"" and ""rare"" synthetic libraries were close to the known proportions, deviating from 0.1% to 10% across all tests. For a 20-species mock community with staggered contributions, a sequencing run detected all but 3 species (each included at < 0.05% of DNA in the total mixture), 91% of reads were assigned to the correct species, 93% of reads were assigned to the correct genus, and > 99% of reads were assigned to the correct family. Conclusions: At the current level of output and sequence quality (just under 4 × 103 2D reads for a synthetic metagenome), MinION sequencing followed by Kraken or One Codex analysis has the potential to provide rapid and accurate metagenomic analysis where the consortium is comprised of a limited number of taxa. Important considerations noted in this study included: high sensitivity of the MinION platform to the quality of input DNA, high variability of sequencing results across libraries and flow cells, and relatively small numbers of 2D reads per analysis limit. Together, these limited detection of very rare components of the microbial consortia, and would likely limit the utility of MinION for the sequencing of high-complexity metagenomic communities where thousands of taxa are expected. Furthermore, the limitations of the currently available data analysis tools suggest there is considerable room for improvement in the analytical approaches for the characterization of microbial communities using long reads. Nevertheless, the fact that the accurate taxonomic assignment of high-quality reads generated by MinION is approaching 99.5% and, in most cases, the inferred community structure mirrors the known proportions of a synthetic mixture warrants further exploration of practical application to environmental metagenomics as the platform continues to develop and improve. With further improvement in sequence throughput and error rate reduction, this platform shows great promise for precise real-time analysis of the composition and structure of more complex microbial communities. © The Author 2017.","Bacteria; DNA, Bacterial; Genomic Library; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Nanopores; Reproducibility of Results; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Species Specificity; Whole Genome Sequencing; bacterial DNA; genomic DNA; bacterial DNA; RNA 16S; analytical equipment; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium detection; genome analysis; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; metagenome; microbial community; nonhuman; priority journal; sequence analysis; species composition; taxonomy; bacterium; chemistry; classification; gene library; genetics; high throughput sequencing; metagenome; metagenomics; nanopore; procedures; reproducibility; species difference; whole genome sequencing","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023195122"

However, the identification of genome structural variations based on NGS approaches with read lengths of 35-300 bases remains a challenge. Single-molecule optical mapping technologies allow the analysis of DNA molecules of up to 2 Mb and as such are suitable for the identification of large-scale genome structural variations, and for de novo genome assemblies when combined with short-read NGS data. Here we present optical mapping data for two human genomes: the HapMap cell line GM12878 and the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116. Findings: High molecular weight DNA was obtained by embedding GM12878 and HCT116 cells, respectively, in agarose plugs, followed by DNA extraction under mild conditions. Genomic DNA was digested with KpnI and 310,000 and 296,000 DNA molecules (>150 kb and 10 restriction fragments), respectively, were analyzed per cell line using the Argus optical mapping system. Maps were aligned to the human reference by OPTIMA, a new glocal alignment method. Genome coverage of 6.8× and 5.7× was obtained, respectively; 2.9× and 1.7× more than the coverage obtained with previously available software. Conclusions: Optical mapping allows the resolution of large-scale structural variations of the genome, and the scaffold extension of NGS-based de novo assemblies.

Users frequently manage these data in spreadsheet programs, which is convenient for researchers who are compiling the requisite information because the spreadsheet programs can easily be used on different platforms including laptops and tablets, and because they provide a familiar interface. It is increasingly common for many different researchers to be involved in compiling these data, including study coordinators, clinicians, lab technicians and bioinformaticians. As a result, many research groups are shifting toward using cloud-based spreadsheet programs, such as Google Sheets, which support the concurrent editing of a single spreadsheet by different users working on different platforms. Most of the researchers who enter data are not familiar with the formatting requirements of the bioinformatics programs that will be used, so validating and correcting file formats is often a bottleneck prior to beginning bioinformatics analysis. Main text: We present Keemei, a Google Sheets Add-on, for validating tabular files used in bioinformatics analyses. Keemei is available free of charge from Google's Chrome Web Store. Keemei can be installed and run on any web browser supported by Google Sheets. Keemei currently supports the validation of two widely used tabular bioinformatics formats, the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) sample metadata mapping file format and the Spatially Referenced Genetic Data (SRGD) format, but is designed to easily support the addition of others. Conclusions: Keemei will save researchers time and frustration by providing a convenient interface for tabular bioinformatics file format validation. By allowing everyone involved with data entry for a project to easily validate their data, it will reduce the validation and formatting bottlenecks that are commonly encountered when human-generated data files are first used with a bioinformatics system. Simplifying the validation of essential tabular data files, such as sample metadata, will reduce common errors and thereby improve the quality and reliability of research outcomes. © 2016 The Author(s).","Cloud Computing; Computational Biology; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Software; User-Computer Interface; Article; bioinformatics; data analysis software; electronic spreadsheet; linear system; priority journal; quality control; reliability; simulation; validation study; web browser; biology; cloud computing; computer interface; human; information retrieval; procedures; software","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991529124"

Insecticide sprays and transgenic cotton producing toxins of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are currently used to manage this pest. Bt toxins kill susceptible insects by specifically binding to and destroying midgut cells, but they are not toxic to most other organisms. Pink bollworm is useful as a model for understanding insect responses to Bt toxins, yet advances in understanding at the molecular level have been limited because basic genomic information is lacking for this cosmopolitan pest. Here, we have sequenced, de novo assembled and annotated a comprehensive larval midgut transcriptome from a susceptible strain of pink bollworm. Findings: A de novo transcriptome assembly for the midgut of P. gossypiella was generated containing 46,458 transcripts (average length of 770 bp) derived from 39,874 unigenes. The size of the transcriptome is similar to published midgut transcriptomes of other Lepidoptera and includes up to 91 % annotated contigs. The dataset is publicly available in NCBI and GigaDB as a resource for researchers. Conclusions: Foundational knowledge of protein-coding genes from the pink bollworm midgut is critical for understanding how this important insect pest functions. The transcriptome data presented here represent the first large-scale molecular resource for this species, and may be used for deciphering relevant midgut proteins critical for xenobiotic detoxification, nutrient digestion and allocation, as well as for the discovery of protein receptors important for Bt intoxication. © 2016 The Author(s).","Animals; Contig Mapping; Endotoxins; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Intestines; Larva; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Moths; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; transcriptome; xenobiotic agent; endotoxin; transcriptome; Article; base pairing; controlled study; de novo assembly; genetic code; genetic resource; genetic transcription; insect genetics; larval stage; Lepidoptera; midgut; nonhuman; Pectinophora gossypiella; phylogeny; Plutella xylostella; priority journal; sequence analysis; species comparison; unigene; animal; chemistry; contig mapping; drug effects; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; intestine; larva; molecular genetics; moth; procedures; sequence analysis","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991529127"

These peptides have proven to be valuable pharmacological probes and potential drugs because of their high specificity and affinity to important ion channels, receptors and transporters of the nervous system. Most previous studies have focused specifically on the conopeptides from piscivorous and molluscivorous cone snails, but little attention has been devoted to the dominant vermivorous species. Results: The vermivorous Chinese tubular cone snail, Conus betulinus, is the dominant Conus species inhabiting the South China Sea. The transcriptomes of venom ducts and venom bulbs from a variety of specimens of this species were sequenced using both next-generation sequencing and traditional Sanger sequencing technologies, resulting in the identification of a total of 215 distinct conopeptides. Among these, 183 were novel conopeptides, including nine new superfamilies. It appeared that most of the identified conopeptides were synthesized in the venom duct, while a handful of conopeptides were identified only in the venom bulb and at very low levels. Conclusions: We identified 215 unique putative conopeptide transcripts from the combination of five transcriptomes and one EST sequencing dataset. Variation in conopeptides from different specimens of C. betulinus was observed, which suggested the presence of intraspecific variability in toxin production at the genetic level. These novel conopeptides provide a potentially fertile resource for the development of new pharmaceuticals, and a pathway for the discovery of new conotoxins. © 2016 Peng et al.","Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; China; Conotoxins; Conus Snail; Gene Expression Profiling; Genetic Variation; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Molecular Sequence Data; Oceans and Seas; Peptides; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity; Transcriptome; conopeptide; conotoxin; peptide; transcriptome; unclassified drug; conotoxin; peptide; transcriptome; amino acid sequence; animal structures; Article; controlled study; Conus betulinus; gene expression; high throughput sequencing; intraspecific variation; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; peptide synthesis; priority journal; snail; venom bulb; venom duct; animal; China; classification; Conus (snail); DNA sequence; gene expression profiling; genetic variation; genetics; high throughput sequencing; molecular genetics; procedures; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sea; species difference","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991529128"

A stunning accomplishment in such a short period of time. However, most of these were sequenced without experimental haplotype data and are therefore missing an important aspect of genome biology. In addition, much of the genomic data is not available to the public and lacks phenotypic information. Findings: As part of the Personal Genome Project, blood samples from 184 participants were collected and processed using Complete Genomics' Long Fragment Read technology. Here, we present the experimental whole genome haplotyping and sequencing of these samples to an average read coverage depth of 100X. This is approximately three-fold higher than the read coverage applied to most whole human genome assemblies and ensures the highest quality results. Currently, 114 genomes from this dataset are freely available in the GigaDB repository and are associated with rich phenotypic data; the remaining 70 should be added in the near future as they are approved through the PGP data release process. For reproducibility analyses, 20 genomes were sequenced at least twice using independent LFR barcoded libraries. Seven genomes were also sequenced using Complete Genomics' standard non-barcoded library process. In addition, we report 2.6 million high-quality, rare variants not previously identified in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms database or the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 data.

However, it remains a great challenge to distinguish RNA-editing sites from genetic variants and technical artifacts caused by sequencing or read-mapping errors. Results: Here we present RES-Scanner, a flexible and efficient software package that detects and annotates RNA-editing sites using matching RNA-seq and DNA-seq data from the same individuals or samples. RES-Scanner allows the use of both raw HTS reads and pre-aligned reads in BAM format as inputs. When inputs are HTS reads, RES-Scanner can invoke the BWA mapper to align reads to the reference genome automatically. To rigorously identify potential false positives resulting from genetic variants, we have equipped RES-Scanner with sophisticated statistical models to infer the reliability of homozygous genotypes called from DNA-seq data. These models are applicable to samples from either single individuals or a pool of multiple individuals if the ploidy information is known. In addition, RES-Scanner implements statistical tests to distinguish genuine RNA-editing sites from sequencing errors, and provides a series of sophisticated filtering options to remove false positives resulting from mapping errors. Finally, RES-Scanner can improve the completeness and accuracy of editing site identification when the data of multiple samples are available. Conclusion: RES-Scanner, as a software package written in the Perl programming language, provides a comprehensive solution that addresses read mapping, homozygous genotype calling, de novo RNA-editing site identification and annotation for any species with matching RNA-seq and DNA-seq data.

B. antarctica is an extremophile with unusual adaptations. The larvae of B. antarctica are desiccation- and freeze-tolerant and the adults are wingless. Recently, the compact genome of B. antarctica was reported and it is the first Antarctic eukaryote to be sequenced. Although P. steinenii occurs naturally in the Antarctic with B. antarctica, the larvae of P. steinenii are cold-tolerant but not freeze-tolerant and the adults are winged. Differences in adaptations in the Antarctic midges are interesting in terms of evolutionary processes within an extreme environment. Herein, we provide the genome of another Antarctic midge to help elucidate the evolution of these species. Results: The draft genome of P. steinenii had a total size of 138 Mbp, comprising 9513 contigs with an N50 contig size of 34,110 bp, and a GC content of 32.2%. Overall, 13,468 genes were predicted using the MAKER annotation pipeline, and gene ontology classified 10,801 (80.2%) predicted genes to a function. Compared with the assembled genome architecture of B. antarctica, that of P. steinenii was approximately 50 Mbp longer with 6.2-fold more repeat sequences, whereas gene regions were as similarly compact as in B. antarctica. Conclusions: We present an annotated draft genome of the Antarctic midge, P. steinenii. The genomes of P. steinenii and B. antarctica will aid in the elucidation of evolution in harsh environments and provide new resources for functional genomic analyses of the order Diptera. © The Author 2017.","Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Chironomidae; Cold Temperature; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Ontology; Genome, Insect; Insect Proteins; Larva; Species Specificity; Whole Genome Sequencing; contig; insect protein; Antarctica; Belgica antarctica; DNA base composition; evolution; gene function; gene ontology; genome; insect; nonhuman; Note; nucleotide repeat; Parochlus steinenii; priority journal; sequence analysis; winged insect; adaptation; animal; Chironomidae; classification; cold; genetics; insect genome; larva; molecular evolution; procedures; species difference; whole genome sequencing","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023160974"

Since de novo chromosome assemblies are confounded by repeat-mediated artifacts, reference-assisted assemblies that use comparative inference have become widely used, prompting the development of several reference-assisted assembly programs for prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Findings: We developed Chromosomer - a reference-based genome arrangement tool, which rapidly builds chromosomes from genome contigs or scaffolds using their alignments to a reference genome of a closely related species. Chromosomer does not require mate-pair libraries and it offers a number of auxiliary tools that implement common operations accompanying the genome assembly process. Conclusions: Despite implementing a straightforward alignment-based approach, Chromosomer is a useful tool for genomic analysis of species without chromosome maps. Putative chromosome assemblies by Chromosomer can be used in comparative genomic analysis, genomic variation assessment, potential linkage group inference and other kinds of analysis involving contig or scaffold mapping to a high-quality assembly. © 2016 The Author(s).","Chromosome Mapping; Contig Mapping; Genome; Sequence Alignment; Software; contig; algorithm; antelope; Article; base pairing; chromosome; Escherichia coli; genome analysis; nonhuman; Pan troglodytes; Pantholops hodgsonii; priority journal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; software; chromosomal mapping; contig mapping; genome; procedures; sequence alignment; software","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007385179"

Analysis of related flaviviruses transmitted by the same vectors suggests that ZIKV dynamics are sensitive to climate seasonality and longer-term variability and trends. A better understanding of the climate conditions conducive to the 2014-2016 epidemic may permit the development of climate-informed short and long-term strategies for ZIKV prevention and control. Results: Using a novel timescale-decomposition methodology, we demonstrate that the extreme climate anomalies observed in most parts of South America during the current epidemic are not caused exclusively by El Niño or climate change, but by a combination of climate signals acting at multiple timescales. In Brazil, the dry conditions present in 2013-2015 are primarily explained by year-to-year variability superimposed on decadal variability, but with little contribution of long-term trends. In contrast, the warm temperatures of 2014-2015 resulted from the compound effect of climate change, decadal and year-to-year climate variability. Conclusions: ZIKV response strategies made in Brazil during the drought concurrent with the 2015-2016 El Niño event, may require revision in light of the likely return of rainfall associated with the borderline La Niña event expected in 2016-2017. Temperatures are likely to remain warm given the importance of long term and decadal scale climate signals. © 2016 The Author(s).","Brazil; Climate Change; Droughts; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Humans; Interrupted Time Series Analysis; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection; rain; virus vector; air temperature; Article; Brazil; circannual rhythm; climate change; controlled study; drought; El Nino; epidemic; geological time; nonhuman; signal processing; temperature; temperature measurement; temperature sensitivity; vector control; warming; Zika virus; epidemiology; human; pathogenicity; Zika virus; Zika Virus Infection","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015979961"

The Oxford Nanopore technology is truly disruptive; it has the potential to revolutionize genomic applications due to its portability, low cost, and ease of use compared with existing long reads sequencing technologies. The MinION sequencer enables the rapid sequencing of small eukaryotic genomes, such as the yeast genome. Combined with existing assembler algorithms, near complete genome assemblies can be generated and comprehensive population genomic analyses can be performed. Results: Here, we resequenced the genome of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C strain to evaluate the performance of nanopore-only assemblers. Then we de novo sequenced and assembled the genomes of 21 isolates representative of the S. cerevisiae genetic diversity using the MinION platform. The contiguity of our assemblies was 14 times higher than the Illumina-only assemblies and we obtained one or two long contigs for 65 % of the chromosomes. This high contiguity allowed us to accurately detect large structural variations across the 21 studied genomes. Conclusion: Because of the high completeness of the nanopore assemblies, we were able to produce a complete cartography of transposable elements insertions and inspect structural variants that are generally missed using a short-read sequencing strategy. Our analyses show that the Oxford Nanopore technology is already usable for de novo sequencing and assembly;however, non-random errors in homopolymers require polishing the consensus using an alternate sequencing technology. © The Author 2017.","Chromosomes, Fungal; Computational Biology; DNA Transposable Elements; DNA, Fungal; Gene Dosage; Genome, Fungal; Genome, Mitochondrial; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Recombination, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Yeasts; DNA fragment; fungal DNA; transposon; Article; chromosome 12; chromosome 3; chromosome analysis; fungal genome; fungal strain; fungus isolation; gene insertion; gene sequence; genetic variation; genome analysis; mitochondrial genome; nanopore; nonhuman; population genetics; priority journal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; sequence alignment; transposon; biology; chromosome; DNA sequence; gene dosage; genetic recombination; genetics; genomics; high throughput sequencing; procedures; yeast","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021859981"

Due to its great economic value in China, the fish was introduced into Lake Dianchi and several other lakes from the Lake Taihu half a century ago. Similar to the Sinocyclocheilus cavefish, the clearhead icefish has certain cavefish-like traits, such as transparent body and nearly scaleless skin. Here, we provide the whole genome sequence of this surface-dwelling fish and generated a draft genome assembly, aiming at exploring molecular mechanisms for the biological interests. Findings: A total of 252.1 Gb of raw reads were sequenced. Subsequently, a novel draft genome assembly was generated, with the scaffold N50 reaching 1.163 Mb. The genome completeness was estimated to be 98.39 % by using the CEGMA evaluation. Finally, we annotated 19 884 protein-coding genes and observed that repeat sequences account for 24.43 % of the genome assembly. Conclusion: We report the first draft genome of the Chinese clearhead icefish. The genome assembly will provide a solid foundation for further molecular breeding and germplasm resource protection in Chinese clearhead icefish, as well as other icefishes. It is also a valuable genetic resource for revealing the molecular mechanisms for the cavefish-like characters. © The Author 2017.","Animals; Computational Biology; Genome; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Osmeriformes; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; animal tissue; fish; gene duplication; genome; molecular evolution; molecular phylogeny; nonhuman; Note; nucleotide repeat; priority journal; Protosalanx hyalocranius; sequence homology; synteny; whole genome sequencing; animal; biology; classification; DNA sequence; genetics; genome; genomics; high throughput sequencing; molecular genetics; Osmeriformes; phenotype; phylogeny; procedures","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021860171"

Because of its high reproductive potential, dispersal capability and transmission of plant viral diseases, S. furcifera causes considerable damage to rice grain production and has great economical and agricultural impacts. Comprehensive studies into ecological aspects and virus-host interactions of S. furcifera have been limited because of the lack of a well-assembled genome sequence. Findings: A total of 241.3 Gb of raw reads from the whole genome of S. furcifera were generated by Illumina sequencing using different combinations of mate-pair and paired-end libraries from 17 insert libraries ranging between 180 bp and 40 kbp. The final genome assembly (0.72 Gb), with average N50 contig size of 70.7 kb and scaffold N50 of 1.18 Mb, covers 98.6 % of the estimated genome size of S. furcifera. Genome annotation, assisted by eight different developmental stages (embryos, 1st-5th instar nymphs, 5-day-old adults and 10-day-old adults), generated 21 254 protein-coding genes, which captured 99.59 % (247/248) of core CEGMA genes and 91.7 % (2453/2675) of BUSCO genes. Conclusions: We report the first assembled and annotated whole genome sequence and transcriptome of S. furcifera.

The influence of such circadian regulation over whole-canopy fluxes remains uncertain; diurnal CO2 and H2O vapor flux dynamics in the field are currently interpreted as resulting almost exclusively from direct physiological responses to variations in light, temperature and other environmental factors. We tested whether circadian regulation would affect plant and canopy gas exchange at the Montpellier European Ecotron. Canopy and leaf-level fluxes were constantly monitored under field-like environmental conditions, and under constant environmental conditions (no variation in temperature, radiation, or other environmental cues).; RESULTS: We show direct experimental evidence at canopy scales of the circadian regulation of daytime gas exchange: 20-79 % of the daily variation range in CO2 and H2O fluxes occurred under circadian entrainment in canopies of an annual herb (bean) and of a perennial shrub (cotton). We also observed that considering circadian regulation improved performance by 8-17 % in commonly used stomatal conductance models.; CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that circadian controls affect diurnal CO2 and H2O flux patterns in entire canopies in field-like conditions, and its consideration significantly improves model performance. Circadian controls act as a 'memory' of the past conditions experienced by the plant, which synchronizes metabolism across entire plant canopies.","Carbon Dioxide; Circadian Clocks; Circadian Rhythm; Ecosystem; Gossypium; Phaseolus; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Stomata; Water; carbon dioxide; water; circadian rhythm; ecosystem; Gossypium; metabolism; Phaseolus; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; plant stoma","","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011614421"

Since its introduction into China in 1984, both cultivation area and yield of this species have been dramatically increased such that China is now the leading producer of channel catfish. To aid genomic research in this species, data sets such as genetic linkage groups, long-insert libraries, physical maps, bacterial artificial clones (BAC) end sequences (BES), transcriptome assemblies, and reference genome sequences have been generated. Here, using diverse assembly methods, we provide a comparable high-quality genome assembly for a channel catfish from a breeding stock inbred in China for more than three generations, which was originally imported to China from North America. Findings: Approximately 201.6 gigabases (Gb) of genome reads were sequenced by the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Subsequently, we generated high quality, cost-effective and easily assembled sequences of the channel catfish genome with a scaffold N50 of 7.2 Mb and 95.6 % completeness. We also predicted that the channel catfish genome contains 21,556 protein-coding genes and 275.3 Mb (megabase pairs) of repetitive sequences. Conclusions: We report a high-quality genome assembly of the channel catfish, which is comparable to a recent report of the ""Coco"" channel catfish. These generated genome data could be used as an initial platform for molecular breeding to obtain novel catfish varieties using genomic approaches. © 2016 The Author(s).","Animals; China; Contig Mapping; Genome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Ictaluridae; Molecular Sequence Annotation; North America; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Analysis, RNA; amino acid sequence; Article; breeding; breeding method; channel catfish; China; genetic code; genetic linkage; genome; genome analysis; genome size; high quality genome assembly; nonhuman; North America; priority journal; quantitative trait locus; RNA sequence; sequence homology; transcriptomics; animal; contig mapping; DNA sequence; genetics; genome; high throughput sequencing; Ictaluridae; molecular genetics; procedures; sequence analysis","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007372837"

However, analyzing such high-throughput data is posing important computational challenges, requiring specialized bioinformatics solutions at different stages during the processing pipeline, such as assembly of paired-end reads, chimera removal, correction of sequencing errors, and clustering of those sequences into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Individual algorithms grappling with each of those challenges have been combined into various bioinformatics pipelines, such as mothur, QIIME, LotuS, and USEARCH. Using a set of well-described bacterial mock communities, state-of-the-art pipelines for Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing data are benchmarked at the level of the amount of sequences retained, computational cost, error rate, and quality of the OTUs. In addition, a new pipeline called OCToPUS is introduced, which is making an optimal combination of different algorithms. Huge variability is observed between the different pipelines in respect to the monitored performance parameters, where in general the amount of retained reads is found to be inversely proportional to the quality of the reads. By contrast, OCToPUS achieves the lowest error rate, minimum number of spurious OTUs, and the closest correspondence to the existing community, while retaining the uppermost amount of reads when compared to other pipelines. The newly introduced pipeline translates Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing data into high-quality and reliable OTUs, with improved performance and accuracy compared to the currently existing pipelines. © The Author 2017.","Algorithms; Computational Biology; Databases, Nucleic Acid; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; Metagenomics; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software; Web Browser; RNA 16S; accuracy; algorithm; amplicon; bioinformatics; DNA sequence; high throughput sequencing; metagenomics; microbial community; nonhuman; Note; prediction; priority journal; reliability; RNA sequence; species composition; taxonomy; biology; DNA barcoding; DNA sequence; nucleic acid database; procedures; software; web browser","Oxford University Press","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021859979"

Despite the availability of multiple sequencing technologies and tools (e.g., assemblers) it is still difficult to assemble new genomes at chromosome resolution (i.e., one sequence per chromosome). Obtaining high quality draft assemblies is extremely important in the case of yeast genomes to better characterise major events in their evolutionary history. The aim of this work is two-fold: on the one hand we want to show how combining different and somewhat complementary technologies is key to improving assembly quality and correctness, and on the other hand we present a de novo assembly pipeline we believe to be beneficial to core facility bioinformaticians. To demonstrate both the effectiveness of combining technologies and the simplicity of the pipeline, here we present the results obtained using the Dekkera bruxellensis genome. Methods: In this work we used short-read Illumina data and long-read PacBio data combined with the extreme long-range information from OpGen optical maps in the task of de novo genome assembly and finishing. Moreover, we developed NouGAT, a semi-automated pipeline for read-preprocessing, de novo assembly and assembly evaluation, which was instrumental for this work. Results: We obtained a high quality draft assembly of a yeast genome, resolved on a chromosomal level. Furthermore, this assembly was corrected for mis-assembly errors as demonstrated by resolving a large collapsed repeat and by receiving higher scores by assembly evaluation tools. With the inclusion of PacBio data we were able to fill about 5 % of the optical mapped genome not covered by the Illumina data. © 2015 Olsen et al.","Chromosome Mapping; Computational Biology; Dekkera; Genome, Fungal; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software; Article; chromosome 1; chromosome 2; data processing; Dekkera; Dekkera bruxellensis; fungal genome; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; optical mapping; priority journal; sequence analysis; biology; chromosomal mapping; Dekkera; DNA sequence; fungal genome; genetics; high throughput sequencing; procedures; software","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006210402"

In 2012, global apple production accounted for at least one tenth of all harvested fruits. A high-quality apple genome assembly is crucial for the selection and breeding of new cultivars. Currently, a single reference genome is available for apple, assembled from 16.9 × genome coverage short reads via Sanger and 454 sequencing technologies. Although a useful resource, this assembly covers only ~89 % of the non-repetitive portion of the genome, and has a relatively short (16.7 kb) contig N50 length. These downsides make it difficult to apply this reference in transcriptive or whole-genome re-sequencing analyses. Findings: Here we present an improved hybrid de novo genomic assembly of apple (Golden Delicious), which was obtained from 76 Gb (~102 × genome coverage) Illumina HiSeq data and 21.7 Gb (~29 × genome coverage) PacBio data. The final draft genome is approximately 632.4 Mb, representing ~ 90 % of the estimated genome. The contig N50 size is 111,619 bp, representing a 7 fold improvement. Further annotation analyses predicted 53,922 protein-coding genes and 2,765 non-coding RNA genes. Conclusions: The new apple genome assembly will serve as a valuable resource for investigating complex apple traits at the genomic level.

Two physiological races of P. nicotianae, races 0 and 1, are predominantly observed in cultivated tobacco fields around the world. Race 0 has been reported to be more aggressive, having a shorter incubation period, and causing worse root rot symptoms, while race 1 causes more severe necrosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying the difference in virulence between race 0 and 1 remain elusive. Findings: We assembled and annotated the genomes of P. nicotianae races 0 and 1, which were obtained by a combination of PacBio single-molecular real-time sequencing and second-generation sequencing (both HiSeq and MiSeq platforms). Gene family analysis revealed a highly expanded ATP-binding cassette transporter gene family in P. nicotianae. Specifically, more RxLR effector genes were found in the genome of race 0 than in that of race 1. In addition, RxLR effector genes were found to be mainly distributed in gene-sparse, repeat-rich regions of the P. nicotianae genome. Conclusions: These results provide not only high quality reference genomes of P. nicotianae, but also insights into the infection mechanisms of P. nicotianae and its co-evolution with the host plant.

As a result, RNA editing is now being studied under a growing number of biological conditions so that its biochemical mechanisms and functional roles can be further understood. However, a major barrier that prevents RNA editing from being a routine RNA-seq analysis, similar to gene expression and splicing analysis, for example, is the lack of user-friendly and effective computational tools. Based on years of experience of analyzing RNA editing using diverse RNA-seq datasets, we have developed a software tool, RED-ML: RNA Editing Detection based on Machine learning (pronounced as ""red ML""). The input to RED-ML can be as simple as a single BAM file, while it can also take advantage of matched genomic variant information when available. The output not only contains detected RNA editing sites, but also a confidence score to facilitate downstream filtering. We have carefully designed validation experiments and performed extensive comparison and analysis to show the efficiency and effectiveness of RED-ML under different conditions, and it can accurately detect novel RNA editing sites without relying on curated RNA editing databases. We have also made this tool freely available via GitHub <https://github.com/BGIRED/RED-ML>. We have developed a highly accurate, speedy and general-purpose tool for RNA editing detection using RNA-seq data. With the availability of RED-ML, it is now possible to conveniently make RNA editing a routine analysis of RNA-seq. We believe this can greatly benefit the RNA editing research community and has profound impact to accelerate our understanding of this intriguing posttranscriptional modification process. © The Author 2017.

(Ginkgoaceae) is one of the most distinctive plants. It possesses a suite of fascinating characteristics including a large genome, outstanding resistance/tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses, and dioecious reproduction, making it an ideal model species for biological studies. However, the lack of a high-quality genome sequence has been an impediment to our understanding of its biology and evolution. Findings: The 10.61 Gb genome sequence containing 41,840 annotated genes was assembled in the present study. Repetitive sequences account for 76.58% of the assembled sequence, and long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are particularly prevalent. The diversity and abundance of LTR-RTs is due to their gradual accumulation and a remarkable amplification between 16 and 24 million years ago, and they contribute to the long introns and large genome. Whole genome duplication (WGD) may have occurred twice, with an ancient WGD consistent with that shown to occur in other seed plants, and a more recent event specific to ginkgo. Abundant gene clusters from tandem duplication were also evident, and enrichment of expanded gene families indicates a remarkable array of chemical and antibacterial defense pathways. Conclusions: The ginkgo genome consists mainly of LTR-RTs resulting from ancient gradual accumulation and two WGD events. The multiple defense mechanisms underlying the characteristic resilience of ginkgo are fostered by a remarkable enrichment in ancient duplicated and ginkgo-specific gene clusters. The present study sheds light on sequencing large genomes, and opens an avenue for further genetic and evolutionary research. © The Author(s). 2016 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

It has an extremely fast growth rate and its endoskeleton is mainly composed of cartilage. Another unique feature of the sunfish is its lack of a caudal fin, which is replaced by a broad and stifflobe that results in the characteristic truncated appearance of the fish. Results: To gain insights into the genomic basis of these phenotypic traits, we sequenced the sunfish genome and performed a comparative analysis with other teleost genomes. Several sunfish genes involved in the growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (GH/IGF1) axis signalling pathway were found to be under positive selection or accelerated evolution, which might explain its fast growth rate and large body size. A number of genes associated with the extracellular matrix, some of which are involved in the regulation of bone and cartilage development, have also undergone positive selection or accelerated evolution. A comparison of the sunfish genome with that of the pufferfish (fugu), which has a caudal fin, revealed that the sunfish contains more homeobox (Hox) genes although both genomes contain seven Hox clusters. Thus, caudal fin loss in sunfish is not associated with the loss of a specific Hox gene. Conclusions: Our analyses provide insights into the molecular basis of the fast growth rate and large size of the ocean sunfish. The high-quality genome assembly generated in this study should facilitate further studies of this 'natural mutant'. © 2016 The Author(s).","Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Genome; Perciformes; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Takifugu; bone morphogenetic protein; growth hormone; proteoglycan; somatomedin C; transcription factor; animal tissue; Article; body size; bone development; caudal fin; chondrogenesis; extracellular matrix; genome; growth rate; Hox gene; Mola mola; nonhuman; population size; priority journal; puffer fish; Tetraodontiformes; anatomy and histology; animal; comparative study; DNA sequence; genetics; genome; growth, development and aging; molecular evolution; Perciformes; phylogeny; procedures; Takifugu","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007318329"

To address this challenge, we assembled or collected the genomes of 48 avian species spanning most orders of birds, including all Neognathae and two of the five Palaeognathae orders. We used these genomes to construct a genome-scale avian phylogenetic tree and perform comparative genomic analyses.Findings: Here we present the datasets associated with the phylogenomic analyses, which include sequence alignment files consisting of nucleotides, amino acids, indels, and transposable elements, as well as tree files containing gene trees and species trees. Inferring an accurate phylogeny required generating: 1) A well annotated data set across species based on genome synteny; 2) Alignments with unaligned or incorrectly overaligned sequences filtered out; and 3) Diverse data sets, including genes and their inferred trees, indels, and transposable elements. Our total evidence nucleotide tree (TENT) data set (consisting of exons, introns, and UCEs) gave what we consider our most reliable species tree when using the concatenation-based ExaML algorithm or when using statistical binning with the coalescence-based MP-EST algorithm (which we refer to as MP-EST*). Other data sets, such as the coding sequence of some exons, revealed other properties of genome evolution, namely convergence.Conclusions: The Avian Phylogenomics Project is the largest vertebrate phylogenomics project to date that we are aware of. The sequence, alignment, and tree data are expected to accelerate analyses in phylogenomics and other related areas. © 2015 Jarvis et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Animals; Birds; Classification; DNA; DNA Transposable Elements; Genome; Genomics; Phylogeny; Sequence Alignment; DNA; transposon; amino acid sequence; Article; bird; controlled study; convergent evolution; exon; genetic algorithm; genome analysis; indel mutation; Neognathae; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogenetic tree; phylogenomics; priority journal; sequence alignment; transposon; animal; bird; chemistry; classification; genetics; genome; genomics; phylogeny; procedures","Oxford University Press","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929606489"

Features are often defined using landmarks and semi-landmarks that are determined a priori based on criteria such as homology or some other measure of biological significance. An alternative, widely used strategy uses computational pattern recognition, in which features are acquired from the image de novo. Subsets of these features are then selected based on objective criteria. Computational pattern recognition has been extensively developed primarily for the classification of samples into groups, whereas landmark methods have been broadly applied to biological inference. Results: To compare these approaches and to provide a general community resource, we have constructed an image database of Drosophila melanogaster wings - individually identifiable and organized by sex, genotype and replicate imaging system - for the development and testing of measurement and classification tools for biological images. We have used this database to evaluate the relative performance of current classification strategies. Several supervised parametric and nonparametric machine learning algorithms were used on principal components extracted from geometric morphometric shape data (landmarks and semi-landmarks). For comparison, we also classified phenotypes based on de novo features extracted from wing images using several computer vision and pattern recognition methods as implemented in the Bioimage Classification and Annotation Tool (BioCAT). Conclusions: Because we were able to thoroughly evaluate these strategies using the publicly available Drosophila wing database, we believe that this resource will facilitate the development and testing of new tools for the measurement and classification of complex biological phenotypes. © 2015 Sonnenschein et al.","Algorithms; Animals; Databases, Factual; Drosophila melanogaster; Female; Genotype; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Wings, Animal; anatomic landmark; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; automated pattern recognition; biometry; classification algorithm; classifier; comparative study; controlled study; data base; discriminant analysis; Drosophila melanogaster; female; genotype; image analysis; image database; imaging software; learning algorithm; male; morphometrics; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; supervised machine learning; support vector machine; unsupervised machine learning; wing; algorithm; anatomy and histology; animal; Drosophila melanogaster; factual database; genotype; image processing; procedures; wing","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991528727"

At the broader scale, national datasets exist for a large number of geospatial features of land, water, and air that are needed to fully understand variation among these ecosystems. However, such datasets originate from different sources and have different spatial and temporal resolutions. By taking an open-science perspective and by combining site-based ecosystem datasets and national geospatial datasets, science gains the ability to ask important research questions related to grand environmental challenges that operate at broad scales. Documentation of such complicated database integration efforts, through peer-reviewed papers, is recommended to foster reproducibility and future use of the integrated database. Here, we describe the major steps, challenges, and considerations in building an integrated database of lake ecosystems, called LAGOS (LAke multi-scaled GeOSpatial and temporal database), that was developed at the sub-continental study extent of 17 US states (1,800,000 km2). LAGOS includes two modules: LAGOSGEO, with geospatial data on every lake with surface area larger than 4 ha in the study extent (~50,000 lakes), including climate, atmospheric deposition, land use/cover, hydrology, geology, and topography measured across a range of spatial and temporal extents; and LAGOSLIMNO, with lake water quality data compiled from ~100 individual datasets for a subset of lakes in the study extent (~10,000 lakes). Procedures for the integration of datasets included: creating a flexible database design; authoring and integrating metadata; documenting data provenance; quantifying spatial measures of geographic data; quality-controlling integrated and derived data; and extensively documenting the database. Our procedures make a large, complex, and integrated database reproducible and extensible, allowing users to ask new research questions with the existing database or through the addition of new data. The largest challenge of this task was the heterogeneity of the data, formats, and metadata. Many steps of data integration need manual input from experts in diverse fields, requiring close collaboration. © 2015 Soranno et al.","Database Management Systems; Ecology; Geographic Information Systems; atmospheric deposition; climate; conceptual framework; documentation; factual database; geographic information system; lake ecosystem; land use; priority journal; quality control; quantitative analysis; reproducibility; Review; surface area; water quality; database management system; ecology; geographic information system","BioMed Central Ltd.","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979581516"

In the past, studying this phenomenon required disturbance of the sample by dissecting the adult. This caused irreversible damage and made the sample unsuitable for future studies. Micro X-ray computed tomography (μCT) is a promising technique, not only to visualise juveniles inside the bursae, but also to keep the sample intact and make the dataset of the scan available for future reference. Findings: Seven μCT scans of five freshly fixed (70 % ethanol) individuals, representing three differently sized brittle star species, provided adequate image quality to determine the numbers, sizes and postures of internally brooded young, as well as anatomy and morphology of adults. No staining agents were necessary to achieve highresolution, high-contrast images, which permitted visualisations of both calcified and soft tissue. The raw data (projection and reconstruction images) are publicly available for download from GigaDB. Conclusions: Brittle stars of all sizes are suitable candidates for μCT imaging. This explicitly adds a new technique to the suite of tools available for studying the development of internally brooded young. The purpose of applying the technique was to visualise juveniles inside the adult, but because of the universally good quality of the dataset, the images can also be used for anatomical or comparative morphology-related studies of adult structures. © 2015 Landschoff et al.","Animals; Datasets as Topic; South Africa; Species Specificity; Starfish; X-Ray Microtomography; Article; body movement; brittle star; calibration; computer assisted tomography; echinoderm; geometry; image analysis; image quality; image reconstruction; priority journal; South African; animal; information processing; micro-computed tomography; physiology; South Africa; species difference; starfish","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979502851"

Many analysis tasks require one to compare k-mer lists from different sequences to find words that are either unique to a specific sequence or common to many sequences. However, no stand-alone k-mer analysis tool currently allows one to perform these algebraic set operations. Findings: We have developed the GenomeTester4 toolkit, which contains a novel tool GListCompare for performing union, intersection and complement (difference) set operations on k-mer lists. We provide examples of how these general operations can be combined to solve a variety of biological analysis tasks.

Here, we present a genomic resource built on the basis of a wild-caught male ZZ central bearded dragon Pogona vitticeps. Findings: The genomic sequence for P. vitticeps, generated on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, comprised 317 Gbp (179X raw read depth) from 13 insert libraries ranging from 250 bp to 40 kbp. After filtering for low-quality and duplicated reads, 146 Gbp of data (83X) was available for assembly. Exceptionally high levels of heterozygosity (0.85 % of single nucleotide polymorphisms plus sequence insertions or deletions) complicated assembly; nevertheless, 96.4 % of reads mapped back to the assembled scaffolds, indicating that the assembly included most of the sequenced genome. Length of the assembly was 1.8 Gbp in 545,310 scaffolds (69,852 longer than 300 bp), the longest being 14.68 Mbp. N50 was 2.29 Mbp. Genes were annotated on the basis of de novo prediction, similarity to the green anole Anolis carolinensis, Gallus gallus and Homo sapiens proteins, and P. vitticeps transcriptome sequence assemblies, to yield 19,406 protein-coding genes in the assembly, 63 % of which had intact open reading frames. Our assembly captured 99 % (246 of 248) of core CEGMA genes, with 93 % (231) being complete.

Accordingly, shotgun metagenome sequencing currently is the method of choice to obtain insights into community composition and the genetic repertoire. Findings: Here, we report on the deeply sequenced metagenome and metatranscriptome of a complex biogas-producing microbial community from an agricultural production-scale biogas plant. We assembled the metagenome and, as an example application, show that we reconstructed most genes involved in the methane metabolism, a key pathway involving methanogenesis performed by methanogenic Archaea. This result indicates that there is sufficient sequencing coverage for most downstream analyses. Conclusions: Sequenced at least one order of magnitude deeper than previous studies, our metagenome data will enable new insights into community composition and the genetic potential of important community members.

Owing to the sheer quantity of data generated, the visualization, analysis, and interpretation of 3D imaging MS data remain a significant challenge. Bioinformatics research in this field is hampered by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets needed to evaluate and compare algorithms. Findings: High-quality 3D imaging MS datasets from different biological systems at several labs were acquired, supplied with overview images and scripts demonstrating how to read them, and deposited into MetaboLights, an open repository for metabolomics data. 3D imaging MS data were collected from five samples using two types of 3D imaging MS. 3D matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging (MALDI) MS data were collected from murine pancreas, murine kidney, human oral squamous cell carcinoma, and interacting microbial colonies cultured in Petri dishes. 3D desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) imaging MS data were collected from a human colorectal adenocarcinoma.

Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) has prevailed in methylation studies due to its costeffectiveness and single-base resolution. The rapid accumulation of RRBS data demands well designed analytical tools. Findings: To streamline the data processing of DNA methylation from multiple RRBS samples, we present a flexible pipeline named SMAP, whose features include: (i) handling of single-and/or paired-end diverse bisulfite sequencing data with reduced false-positive rates in differentially methylated regions; (ii) detection of allele-specific methylation events with improved algorithms; (iii) a built-in pipeline for detection of novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); (iv) support of multiple user-defined restriction enzymes; (v) conduction of all methylation analyses in a single-step operation when well configured. Conclusions: Simulation and experimental data validated the high accuracy of SMAP for SNP detection and methylation identification. Most analyses required in methylation studies (such as estimation of methylation levels, differentially methylated cytosine groups, and allele-specific methylation regions) can be executed readily with SMAP. All raw data from diverse samples could be processed in parallel and 'packetized' streams.

Obtaining DNA sequence information is an important part of achieving this goal as it facilitates efforts to associate specific DNA differences with phenotypic variation. These associations can be used to guide breeding decisions and provide valuable insight into the molecular basis of traits. Findings: We describe a dataset of 379 whole-genome sequences, taken primarily from key historic Bos taurus animals, along with the analyses that were performed to assess data quality. The sequenced animals represent ten populations relevant to beef or dairy production. Animal information (name, breed, population), sequence data metrics (mapping rate, depth, concordance), and sequence repository identifiers (NCBI BioProject and BioSample IDs) are provided to enable others to access and exploit this sequence information. Conclusions: The large number of whole-genome sequences generated as a result of this project will contribute to ongoing work aiming to catalogue the variation that exists in cattle as well as efforts to improve traits through genotype-guided selection.

Interpretation and visualization of DNA methylation data can mask complexity in terms of methylation status at each CpG site, cellular heterogeneity of samples and allelic DNA methylation patterns within a given DNA strand. Bisulfite sequencing is considered the gold standard, but visualization of massively parallel sequencing results remains a significant challenge. Findings: We created a program called Methpat that facilitates visualization and interpretation of bisulfite sequencing data generated by massively parallel sequencing. To demonstrate this, we performed multiplex PCR that targeted 48 regions of interest across 86 human samples. The regions selected included known gene promoters associated with cancer, repetitive elements, known imprinted regions and mitochondrial genomic sequences. We interrogated a range of samples including human cell lines, primary tumours and primary tissue samples. Methpat generates two forms of output: a tab-delimited text file for each sample that summarizes DNA methylation patterns and their read counts for each amplicon, and a HTML file that summarizes this data visually. Methpat can be used with publicly available whole genome bisulfite sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing datasets with sufficient read depths. Conclusions: Using Methpat, complex DNA methylation data derived from massively parallel sequencing can be summarized and visualized for biological interpretation. By accounting for allelic DNA methylation states and their abundance in a sample, Methpat can unmask the complexity of DNA methylation and yield further biological insight in existing datasets. © 2015 Wong et al.","Cell Line; DNA Methylation; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Neoplasms; Organ Specificity; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software; amplicon; Article; bisulfate sequencing; cancer cell line; cancer genetics; cancer tissue; computer program; DNA methylation; DNA structure; human; massively parallel sequencing; mitochondrial genome; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; promoter region; repetitive element; sequence analysis; antibody specificity; cell line; DNA sequence; genetics; high throughput sequencing; neoplasm; procedures; software","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991528494"

Here we evaluate a suite of environmental DNA (eDNA) markers coupled with next generation sequencing (NGS) that span the tree of life, comparing them with traditional biodiversity monitoring tools within ten 20 × 20 meter plots along a 700 meter elevational gradient. Results: From six eDNA datasets (one from each of 16S, 18S, ITS, trnL and two from COI) we identified sequences from 109 NCBI taxonomy-defined phyla or equivalent, ranging from 31 to 60 for a given eDNA marker. Estimates of alpha and gamma diversity were sensitive to the number of sequence reads, whereas beta diversity estimates were less sensitive. The average within-plot beta diversity was lower than between plots for all markers. The soil beta diversity of COI and 18S markers showed the strongest response to the elevational variation of the eDNA markers (COI: r = 0.49, p < 0.001; 18S: r = 0.48, p < 0.001). Furthermore pairwise beta diversities for these two markers were strongly correlated with those calculated from traditional vegetation and invertebrate biodiversity measures. Conclusions: Using a soil-based eDNA approach, we demonstrate that standard phylogenetic markers are capable of recovering sequences from a broad diversity of eukaryotes, in addition to prokaryotes by 16S. The COI and 18S eDNA markers are the best proxies for aboveground biodiversity based on the high correlation between the pairwise beta diversities of these markers and those obtained using traditional methods.","Animals; Biodiversity; DNA; Multigene Family; DNA; RNA 16S; DNA; 16S rRNA gene; 18S gene; Article; biodiversity; cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene; DNA marker; DNA sequence; eukaryote; gene; invertebrate; ITS gen; New Zealand; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; trnL gene; unindexed sequence; vegetation; animal; genetics; multigene family","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979570841"

This is in contrast to the original CAFA challenge in which participants were asked to submit predictions for proteins with no existing annotations. The CAFA2 task is more realistic, in that it more closely mimics the accumulation of annotations over time. In this study we compare these tasks in terms of their difficulty, and determine whether cross-validation provides a good estimate of performance. Results: The CAFA2 task is a combination of two subtasks: making predictions on annotated proteins and making predictions on previously unannotated proteins. In this study we analyze the performance of several function prediction methods in these two scenarios. Our results show that several methods (structured support vector machine, binary support vector machines and guilt-by-association methods) do not usually achieve the same level of accuracy on these two tasks as that achieved by cross-validation, and that predicting novel annotations for previously annotated proteins is a harder problem than predicting annotations for uncharacterized proteins. We also find that different methods have different performance characteristics in these tasks, and that cross-validation is not adequate at estimating performance and ranking methods. Conclusions: These results have implications for the design of computational experiments in the area of automated function prediction and can provide useful insight for the understanding and design of future CAFA competitions.","Databases, Protein; Proteins; protein; algorithm; analytic method; Article; binary support vector machine; computer network; gene ontology; guilt by association method; human; machine learning; mathematical computing; mathematical model; molecular genetics; nonhuman; performance; prediction; priority journal; protein analysis; protein function; protein interaction; structured support vector machine; validation study; physiology; protein database","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979587278"

Galaxy offers multiple ways to give access to this data through its web interface. However, the process of adding new reference data was customarily manual and time consuming, even more so when this data needed to be indexed in a variety of formats (e.g. Blast, Bowtie, BWA, or 2bit). BioMAJ is a widely used and stable software that is designed to automate the download and transformation of data from various sources. This data can be used directly from the command line, in more complex systems, such as Mobyle, or by using a REST API. Findings: To ease the process of giving access to reference data in Galaxy, we have developed the BioMAJ2Galaxy module, which enables the gap between BioMAJ and Galaxy to be bridged. With this module, it is now possible to configure BioMAJ to automatically download some reference data, to then convert and/or index it in various formats, and then make this data available in a Galaxy server using data libraries or data managers.

Establishing this important connection between genotype and phenotype is complicated by the large number of candidate genes, the potentially large number of causal loci, and the likely presence of some nonlinear interactions between different genes. Compressed Sensing methods obtain solutions to under-constrained systems of linear equations. These methods can be applied to the problem of determining the best model relating genotype to phenotype, and generally deliver better performance than simply regressing the phenotype against each genetic variant, one at a time. We introduce a Compressed Sensing method that can reconstruct nonlinear genetic models (i.e., including epistasis, or gene-gene interactions) from phenotype-genotype (GWAS) data. Our method uses L1-penalized regression applied to nonlinear functions of the sensing matrix. Results: The computational and data resource requirements for our method are similar to those necessary for reconstruction of linear genetic models (or identification of gene-trait associations), assuming a condition of generalized sparsity, which limits the total number of gene-gene interactions. An example of a sparse nonlinear model is one in which a typical locus interacts with several or even many others, but only a small subset of all possible interactions exist. It seems plausible that most genetic architectures fall in this category. We give theoretical arguments suggesting that the method is nearly optimal in performance, and demonstrate its effectiveness on broad classes of nonlinear genetic models using simulated human genomes and the small amount of currently available real data. A phase transition (i.e., dramatic and qualitative change) in the behavior of the algorithm indicates when sufficient data is available for its successful application. Conclusion: Our results indicate that predictive models for many complex traits, including a variety of human disease susceptibilities (e.g., with additive heritability h2 ~ 0.5), can be extracted from data sets comprised of n* ~ 100s individuals, where s is the number of distinct causal variants influencing the trait.

With the ever-increasing development of genome sequencing technologies, more and more sequence information is becoming available to analyze and annotate. To achieve fast and automatic function annotation, many computational (automated) function prediction (AFP) methods have been developed. To objectively evaluate the performance of such methods on a large scale, community-wide assessment experiments have been conducted. The second round of the Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) experiment was held in 2013-2014. Evaluation of participating groups was reported in a special interest group meeting at the Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in Boston in 2014. Our group participated in both CAFA1 and CAFA2 using multiple, in-house AFP methods. Here, we report benchmark results of our methods obtained in the course of preparation for CAFA2 prior to submitting function predictions for CAFA2 targets. Results: For CAFA2, we updated the annotation databases used by our methods, protein function prediction (PFP) and extended similarity group (ESG), and benchmarked their function prediction performances using the original (older) and updated databases. Performance evaluation for PFP with different settings and ESG are discussed. We also developed two ensemble methods that combine function predictions from six independent, sequence-based AFP methods. We further analyzed the performances of our prediction methods by enriching the predictions with prior distribution of gene ontology (GO) terms. Examples of predictions by the ensemble methods are discussed. Conclusions: Updating the annotation database was successful, improving the Fmax prediction accuracy score for both PFP and ESG. Adding the prior distribution of GO terms did not make much improvement. Both of the ensemble methods we developed improved the average Fmax score over all individual component methods except for ESG. Our benchmark results will not only complement the overall assessment that will be done by the CAFA organizers, but also help elucidate the predictive powers of sequence-based function prediction methods in general.","Databases, Protein; Proteins; protein; accuracy; algorithm; amino acid sequence; Article; bioinformatics; factual database; gene ontology; prediction; priority journal; protein function; sensitivity and specificity; physiology; protein database","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979641410"

Novel methods that can efficiently process the growing volumes of sequence data are necessary for the accurate analysis and interpretation of existing and upcoming metagenomes. Findings: Here we present Tentacle, which is a novel framework that uses distributed computational resources for gene quantification in metagenomes. Tentacle is implemented using a dynamic master-worker approach in which DNA fragments are streamed via a network and processed in parallel on worker nodes. Tentacle is modular, extensible, and comes with support for six commonly used sequence aligners. It is easy to adapt Tentacle to different applications in metagenomics and easy to integrate into existing workflows.

We have sequenced and assembled the transcriptome of this wasp using tissue from four different life stages: larvae, pupae, adult males and adult females, with the aim to contribute foundational resources to aid in the understanding of the biology and behavior of this important parasitoid. Findings: The transcriptome of the parasitic wasp Fopius arisanus was sequenced and reconstructed using a strategy that identified 15,346 high confidence, non-redundant transcripts derived from 8,307 predicted unigenes. In addition, Pfam domain annotations were detected in 78 % of these transcripts. The distribution of transcript length is comparable to that found in other hymenoptera genomes. Through orthology analysis, 7,154 transcripts were identified as having orthologs in at least one of the four other hymenopteran parasitoid species examined. Approximately 4,000 core orthologs were found to be shared between F. arisanus and all four of the other parasitoids. Conclusions: Availability of high quality genomic data is fundamental for the improvement and advancement of research in any biological organism. Parasitic wasps are important in the biological control of agricultural pests. The transcriptome data presented here represent the first large-scale molecular resource for this species, or any closely related Opiine species.

However, they are often underused because of degradation and chemical modifications occurring in the RNA that can present obstacles in downstream analysis. In routine medical care, FFPE material is examined and archived, therefore clinical collections of many types of cancers exist. It is beneficial to assess and record the quality of data that can be obtained from this type of material. The current study investigated three independent platforms and their ability to profile microRNAs (miRNAs) within FFPE samples from hepatoblastoma (HB) patients. Findings: Here we present three types of datasets consisting of miRNA profiles for 13 HB patients with different tumour types and molecular variations. The three platforms that were used to generate these data are: next-generation sequencing (Illumina MiSeq), microarray (Affymetrix® GeneChip® miRNA 3.0 array) and NanoString (nCounter, Human v2 miRNA Assay). The mature miRNAs identified are based on miRBase version 17 and 18. Conclusions: These datasets provide a global landscape of miRNA expression for a rare childhood cancer that has not previously been well characterised.

Three methods are commonly used for WGA: multiple displacement amplification (MDA), degenerate-oligonucleotide-primed PCR (DOP-PCR) and multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (MALBAC). However, a comprehensive comparison of variations detection performance between these WGA methods has not yet been performed. Results: We systematically compared the advantages and disadvantages of different WGA methods, focusing particularly on variations detection. Low-coverage whole-genome sequencing revealed that DOP-PCR had the highest duplication ratio, but an even read distribution and the best reproducibility and accuracy for detection of copy-number variations (CNVs). However, MDA had significantly higher genome recovery sensitivity (~84 %) than DOP-PCR (~6 %) and MALBAC (~52 %) at high sequencing depth. MALBAC and MDA had comparable single-nucleotide variations detection efficiency, false-positive ratio, and allele drop-out ratio. We further demonstrated that SCRS data amplified by either MDA or MALBAC from a gastric cancer cell line could accurately detect gastric cancer CNVs with comparable sensitivity and specificity, including amplifications of 12p11.22 (KRAS) and 9p24.1 (JAK2, CD274, and PDCD1LG2). Conclusions: Our findings provide a comprehensive comparison of variations detection performance using SCRS amplified by different WGA methods. It will guide researchers to determine which WGA method is best suited to individual experimental needs at single-cell level.","DNA Copy Number Variations; Genome; Single-Cell Analysis; genomic DNA; Janus kinase 2; programmed death 1 ligand 1; programmed death 1 ligand 2; Article; CD274 gene; chromosome 12p; chromosome 9p; controlled study; copy number variation; degenerate oligonucleotide primed polymerase chain reaction; DNA sequence; false positive result; gastric cancer cell line; gene amplification; human; human cell; intermethod comparison; JAK2 gene; measurement accuracy; multiple annealing and looping based amplification cycle; multiple displacement amplification; oncogene K ras; PDCD1LG2 gene; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; sequence analysis; single cell analysis; single cell resequencing; stomach cancer; whole genome amplification; comparative study; copy number variation; genetics; genome","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979520403"

There are a series of protocol steps to be followed in the preparation of samples for next-generation sequencing. The quantification of bias in a number of protocol steps, namely DNA fractionation, blunting, phosphorylation, adapter ligation and library enrichment, remains to be determined. Results: We examined the experimental metadata of the public repository Sequence Read Archive (SRA) in order to ascertain the level of annotation of important sequencing steps in submissions to the database. Using SQL relational database queries (using the SRAdb SQLite database generated by the Bioconductor consortium) to search for keywords commonly occurring in key preparatory protocol steps partitioned over studies, we found that 7.10%, 5.84% and 7.57% of all records (fragmentation, ligation and enrichment, respectively), had at least one keyword corresponding to one of the three protocol steps. Only 4.06% of all records, partitioned over studies, had keywords for all three steps in the protocol (5.58% of all SRA records). Conclusions: The current level of annotation in the SRA inhibits systematic studies of bias due to these protocol steps. Downstream from this, meta-analyses and comparative studies based on these data will have a source of bias that cannot be quantified at present. © 2015 Alnasir and Shanahan.","Computational Biology; Internet; User-Computer Interface; Article; data base; DNA fragmentation; DNA sequence; high throughput sequencing; information system; methodology; next generation sequencing; priority journal; biology; computer interface; Internet","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979500816"

Many tools based on DNA re-sequencing exist for identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions and deletions (indels) as well as large deletions. However, these approaches consistently display a substantial bias against the recovery of complex structural variants and novel sequence in individual genomes and do not provide interpretation information such as the annotation of ancestral state and formation mechanism. Findings: We present a novel approach implemented in a single software package, AsmVar, to discover, genotype and characterize different forms of structural variation and novel sequence from population-scale de novo genome assemblies up to nucleotide resolution. Application of AsmVar to several human de novo genome assemblies captures a wide spectrum of structural variants and novel sequences present in the human population in high sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: Our method provides a direct solution for investigating structural variants and novel sequences from de novo genome assemblies, facilitating the construction of population-scale pan-genomes.

In the skin, interfollicular keratinocytes differentiate over approximately 2 weeks as they traverse the epidermis. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) branch of the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has been implicated in this process. Therefore, we examined ERK-MAPK activity within human epidermal keratinocytes in situ. Findings: We used confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence labelling to measure the relative abundances of Raf-1, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, and their phosphorylated (active) forms within three human skin samples. Additionally, we measured the abundance of selected proteins thought to modulate ERK-MAPK activity, including calmodulin, β1 integrin and stratifin (14-3-3σ); and of transcription factors known to act as effectors of ERK1/2, including the AP-1 components Jun-B, Fra2 and c-Fos. Imaging was performed with sufficient resolution to identify the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus as distinct domains within cells across the epidermis. The image field of view was also sufficiently large to capture the entire epidermis in cross-section, and thus the full range of keratinocyte differentiation in a single observation. Image processing methods were developed to quantify image data for mathematical and statistical analysis. Here, we provide raw image data and processed outputs. Conclusions: These data indicate coordinated changes in ERK-MAPK signalling activity throughout the depth of the epidermis, with changes in relative phosphorylation-mediated signalling activity occurring along the gradient of cellular differentiation. We believe these data provide unique information about intracellular signalling as they are obtained from a homeostatic human tissue, and they might be useful for investigating intercellular heterogeneity. © 2015 Cursons et al.","Epidermis; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Fluorescence; Fos-Related Antigen-2; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Keratinocytes; MAP Kinase Kinase 1; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos; Transcription Factor AP-1; Transcription Factors; beta1 integrin; calmodulin; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 2; protein c fos; Raf protein; stratifin; transcription factor; transcription factor AP 1; transcription factor Fra 2; transcription factor JunB; JunB protein, human; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1; protein c fos; transcription factor; transcription factor AP 1; transcription factor Fra 2; Article; cell differentiation; cell heterogeneity; cell membrane; cell nucleus; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cytoplasm; enzyme activity; enzyme phosphorylation; epidermis; fluorescence imaging; human; human cell; human tissue; image analysis; image processing; immunofluorescence; in situ hybridization; keratinocyte; mathematical analysis; priority journal; protein domain; skin; statistical analysis; cytology; epidermis; fluorescence; keratinocyte; metabolism; signal transduction","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991529238"

Detection of BRCA mutation carriers can lead to therapeutic interventions such as mastectomy, oophorectomy, hormonal prevention therapy, improved screening, and targeted therapies such as PARP-inhibition. We estimate that African Americans and Hispanics are 4-5 times less likely to receive BRCA screening, despite having similar mutation frequencies as non-Jewish Caucasians, who have higher breast cancer mortality. To begin addressing this health disparity, we initiated a nationwide trial of BRCA testing of Latin American women with breast cancer. Patients were recruited through community organizations, clinics, public events, and by mail and Internet. Subjects completed the consent process and questionnaire, and provided a saliva sample by mail or in person. DNA from 120 subjects was used to sequence the entirety of BRCA1 and BRCA2 coding regions and splice sites, and validate pathogenic mutations, with a total material cost of $85/subject. Subjects ranged in age from 23 to 81 years (mean age, 51 years), 6 % had bilateral disease, 57 % were ER/PR+, 23 % HER2+, and 17 % had triple-negative disease. Results: A total of seven different predicted deleterious mutations were identified, one newly described and the rest rare. In addition, four variants of unknown effect were found. Conclusions: Application of this strategy on a larger scale could lead to improved cancer care of minority and underserved populations.","Breast Neoplasms; Female; Genes, BRCA1; Genes, BRCA2; Hispanic Americans; Humans; BRCA1 protein; BRCA2 protein; DNA; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; progesterone receptor; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; breast cancer; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; DNA determination; DNA splicing; genetic variability; health disparity; Hispanic; human; informed consent; major clinical study; population research; priority journal; questionnaire; saliva analysis; sequence analysis; South and Central America; triple negative breast cancer; very elderly; breast tumor; female; genetics; tumor suppressor gene","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979529739"

It is valued in traditional Chinese medicine, primarily for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Because of its pharmacological potential, ongoing research aims to identify novel bioactive compounds in danshen, and their biosynthetic pathways. To date, only expressed sequence tag (EST) and RNA-seq data for this herbal plant are available to the public. We therefore propose that the construction of a reference genome for danshen will help elucidate the biosynthetic pathways of important secondary metabolites, thereby advancing the investigation of novel drugs from this plant. Findings: We assembled the highly heterozygous danshen genome with the help of 395 × raw read coverage using Illumina technologies and about 10 × raw read coverage by using single molecular sequencing technology. The final draft genome is approximately 641 Mb, with a contig N50 size of 82.8 kb and a scaffold N50 size of 1.2 Mb. Further analyses predicted 34,598 protein-coding genes and 1,644 unique gene families in the danshen genome.

Although more than 200,000 phosphorylation sites have been reported in the human genome, the physiological roles of most remain unknown. In this study, we provide some useful datasets for the assessment of functional phosphorylation signaling using a comparative genome analysis of phosphorylation motifs. Findings: We described the evolutionary patterns of conservation of these and comparative genomic data for 93,101 phosphosites and 1,003,756 potential phosphosites in human phosphomotifs, using 178 phosphomotifs identified in a previous study that occupied 69% of known phosphosites in public databases. Comparative genomic analyses were performed using genomes from nine species from yeast to humans. Here we provide an overview of the evolutionary patterns of phosphomotif acquisition and indicate the dependence on motif structures. Using the data from our previous study, we describe the interaction networks of phosphoproteins, identify the kinase substrates associated with phosphoproteins, and perform gene ontology enrichment analyses. In addition, we show how this dataset can help to elucidate the function of phosphomotifs. Conclusions: Our characterizations of motif structures and assessments of evolutionary conservation of phosphosites reveal physiological roles of unreported phosphosites. Thus, interactions between protein groups that share motifs are likely to be helpful for inferring kinase-substrate interaction networks.

However, sequencing errors in the already short RNA-seq reads complicate bioinformatics analyses, in particular alignment and assembly. Error correction methods have been highly effective for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) reads, but are unsuitable for RNA-seq reads, owing to the variation in gene expression levels and alternative splicing. Findings: We developed a k-mer based method, Rcorrector, to correct random sequencing errors in Illumina RNA-seq reads. Rcorrector uses a De Bruijn graph to compactly represent all trusted k-mers in the input reads. Unlike WGS read correctors, which use a global threshold to determine trusted k-mers, Rcorrector computes a local threshold at every position in a read. Conclusions: Rcorrector has an accuracy higher than or comparable to existing methods, including the only other method (SEECER) designed for RNA-seq reads, and is more time and memory efficient.

The most common e-infrastructure for analyzing this data consists of batch systems that are based on high-performance computing resources; however, the bioinformatics software that is built on this platform does not scale well in the general case. Recently, the Hadoop platform has emerged as an interesting option to address the challenges of increasingly large datasets with distributed storage, distributed processing, built-in data locality, fault tolerance, and an appealing programming methodology. Results: In this work we introduce metrics and report on a quantitative comparison between Hadoop and a single node of conventional high-performance computing resources for the tasks of short read mapping and variant calling. We calculate efficiency as a function of data size and observe that the Hadoop platform is more efficient for biologically relevant data sizes in terms of computing hours for both split and un-split data files. We also quantify the advantages of the data locality provided by Hadoop for NGS problems, and show that a classical architecture with network-attached storage will not scale when computing resources increase in numbers. Measurements were performed using ten datasets of different sizes, up to 100 gigabases, using the pipeline implemented in Crossbow. To make a fair comparison, we implemented an improved preprocessor for Hadoop with better performance for splittable data files. For improved usability, we implemented a graphical user interface for Crossbow in a private cloud environment using the CloudGene platform. All of the code and data in this study are freely available as open source in public repositories. Conclusions: From our experiments we can conclude that the improved Hadoop pipeline scales better than the same pipeline on high-performance computing resources, we also conclude that Hadoop is an economically viable option for the common data sizes that are currently used in massively parallel sequencing. Given that datasets are expected to increase over time, Hadoop is a framework that we envision will have an increasingly important role in future biological data analysis. © 2015 Siretskiy et al.","Computational Biology; Internet; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software; Article; computer interface; controlled study; data analysis; data analysis software; DNA sequence; information; information system; measurement; priority journal; quantitative analysis; biology; computer program; DNA sequence; Internet; procedures","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979619031"

When this microbial ecosystem becomes disrupted, the health of the human host can suffer; a condition called dysbiosis. However, the community compositions of human microbiomes also vary dramatically from individual to individual, and over time, making it difficult to uncover the underlying mechanisms linking the microbiome to human health. We propose that a microbiome's interaction with its human host is not necessarily dependent upon the presence or absence of particular bacterial species, but instead is dependent on its community metabolome; an emergent property of the microbiome. Results: Using data from a previously published, longitudinal study of microbiome populations of the human gut, we extrapolated information about microbiome community enzyme profiles and metabolome models. Using machine learning techniques, we demonstrated that the aggregate predicted community enzyme function profiles and modeled metabolomes of a microbiome are more predictive of dysbiosis than either observed microbiome community composition or predicted enzyme function profiles. Conclusions: Specific enzyme functions and metabolites predictive of dysbiosis provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of microbiome-host interactions. The ability to use machine learning to predict dysbiosis from microbiome community interaction data provides a potentially powerful tool for understanding the links between the human microbiome and human health, pointing to potential microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. © 2015 Larsen and Dai.","Humans; Intestines; Metabolome; Microbiota; Support Vector Machine; virulence factor; analytical parameters; Article; bacterial genome; Bray Curtis dissimilarity index; community structure; digestion; dysbiosis; enzyme activity; host; host pathogen interaction; human; intestine flora; longitudinal study; machine learning; metabolome; metagenomics; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; support vector machine; vitamin metabolism; intestine; microbiology; microflora","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006192496"

Ostrich meat is considered a healthy red meat, with an annual worldwide production ranging from 12,000 to 15,000 tons. As part of the avian phylogenomics project, we sequenced the ostrich genome for phylogenetic and comparative genomics analyses. The initial Illumina-based assembly of this genome had a scaffold N50 of 3.59 Mb and a total size of 1.23 Gb. Since longer scaffolds are critical for many genomic analyses, particularly for chromosome-level comparative analysis, we generated optical mapping (OM) data to obtain an improved assembly. The OM technique is a non-PCR-based method to generate genome-wide restriction enzyme maps, which improves the quality of de novo genome assembly. Findings: In order to generate OM data, we digested the ostrich genome with KpnI, which yielded 1.99 million DNA molecules (> 250 kb) and covered the genome at least 500×. The pattern of molecules was subsequently assembled to align with the Illumina-based assembly to achieve sequence extension. This resulted in an OM assembly with a scaffold N50 of 17.71 Mb, which is 5 times as large as that of the initial assembly. The number of scaffolds covering 90% of the genome was reduced from 414 to 75, which means an average of ~3 super-scaffolds for each chromosome. Upon integrating the OM data with previously published FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) markers, we recovered the full PAR (pseudoatosomal region) on the ostrich Z chromosome with 4 super-scaffolds, as well as most of the degenerated regions. Conclusions: The OM data significantly improved the assembled scaffolds of the ostrich genome and facilitated chromosome evolution studies in birds. Similar strategies can be applied to other genome sequencing projects to obtain better assemblies. © 2015 Zhang et al.","Animals; Genome; Phylogeny; Article; data processing; fluorescence in situ hybridization; genome; genome assembly; high throughput sequencing; nonhuman; optical mapping; ostrich; priority journal; sequence alignment; sex chromosome; Struthio camelus; animal; genetics; genome; phylogeny","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979582275"

The difficulty in assembling reads into finished genomes is exacerbated by sequence repeats and the inability of short reads to capture sufficient genomic information to resolve those problematic regions. In this regard, established and emerging long read technologies show great promise, but their current associated higher error rates typically require computational base correction and/or additional bioinformatics pre-processing before they can be of value. Results: We present LINKS, the Long Interval Nucleotide K-mer Scaffolder algorithm, a method that makes use of the sequence properties of nanopore sequence data and other error-containing sequence data, to scaffold high-quality genome assemblies, without the need for read alignment or base correction. Here, we show how the contiguity of an ABySS Escherichia coli K-12 genome assembly can be increased greater than five-fold by the use of beta-released Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd. long reads and how LINKS leverages long-range information in Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303 nanopore reads to yield assemblies whose resulting contiguity and correctness are on par with or better than that of competing applications. We also present the re-scaffolding of the colossal white spruce (Picea glauca) draft assembly (PG29, 20 Gbp) and demonstrate how LINKS scales to larger genomes. Conclusions: This study highlights the present utility of nanopore reads for genome scaffolding in spite of their current limitations, which are expected to diminish as the nanopore sequencing technology advances. We expect LINKS to have broad utility in harnessing the potential of long reads in connecting high-quality sequences of small and large genome assembly drafts.","Genome; Sequence Alignment; algorithm; Arabidopsis thaliana; Article; DNA sequence; Escherichia coli K 12; genome; long interval nucleotide k mer scaffolder algorithm; nanopore; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; priority journal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi; white spruce; sequence alignment","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979584495"
