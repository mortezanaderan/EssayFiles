Federal policies call for efficient and equitable local responses to homelessness. However, the overwhelming demand for limited homeless assistance is challenging without empirically supported decision-making tools and raises questions of whom to serve with scarce resources. MATERIALS AND METHODS: System-wide administrative records capture the delivery of an array of homeless services (prevention, shelter, short-term housing, supportive housing) and whether households reenter the system within 2 years. Counterfactual machine learning identifies which service most likely prevents reentry for each household. Based on community input, predictions are aggregated for subpopulations of interest (race/ethnicity, gender, families, youth, and health conditions) to generate transparent prioritization rules for whom to serve first. Simulations of households entering the system during the study period evaluate whether reallocating services based on prioritization rules compared with services-as-usual. RESULTS: Homelessness prevention benefited households who could access it, while differential effects exist for homeless households that partially align with community interests. Households with comorbid health conditions avoid homelessness most when provided longer-term supportive housing, and families with children fare best in short-term rentals. No additional differential effects existed for intersectional subgroups. Prioritization rules reduce community-wide homelessness in simulations. Moreover, prioritization mitigated observed reentry disparities for female and unaccompanied youth without excluding Black and families with children. DISCUSSION: Leveraging administrative records with machine learning supplements local decision-making and enables ongoing evaluation of data- and equity-driven homeless services. CONCLUSIONS: Community- and data-driven prioritization rules more equitably target scarce homeless resources. © The Author(s) 2023.

Little is known, however, about referring primary care providers' (PCPs') preferences for this technology. METHODS: We identified the most important attributes of AI BCS for ordering PCPs using qualitative interviews: sensitivity, specificity, radiologist involvement, understandability of AI decision-making, supporting evidence, and diversity of training data. We invited US-based PCPs to participate in an internet-based experiment designed to force participants to trade off among the attributes of hypothetical AI BCS products. Responses were analyzed with random parameters logit and latent class models to assess how different attributes affect the choice to recommend AI-enhanced screening. RESULTS: Ninety-one PCPs participated. Sensitivity was most important, and most PCPs viewed radiologist participation in mammography interpretation as important. Other important attributes were specificity, understandability of AI decision-making, and diversity of data. We identified 3 classes of respondents: ""Sensitivity First"" (41%) found sensitivity to be more than twice as important as other attributes; ""Against AI Autonomy"" (24%) wanted radiologists to confirm every image; ""Uncertain Trade-Offs"" (35%) viewed most attributes as having similar importance. A majority (76%) accepted the use of AI in a ""triage"" role that would allow it to filter out likely negatives without radiologist confirmation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Sensitivity was the most important attribute overall, but other key attributes should be addressed to produce clinically acceptable products. We also found that most PCPs accept the use of AI to make determinations about likely negative mammograms without radiologist confirmation. © The Author(s) 2020.

While current standard of HAI risk prediction utilizes only a narrow set of predefined clinical variables, we propose a graph convolutional neural network (GNN)-based model which incorporates a wide variety of clinical features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our GNN-based model defines patients' similarity based on comprehensive clinical history and demographics and predicts all types of HAI rather than focusing on a single subtype. An HAI model was trained on 38 327 unique hospitalizations while a distinct model for surgical site infection (SSI) prediction was trained on 18 609 hospitalization. Both models were tested internally and externally on a geographically disparate site with varying infection rates. RESULTS: The proposed approach outperformed all baselines (single-modality models and length-of-stay [LoS]) with achieved area under the receiver operating characteristics of 0.86 [0.84-0.88] and 0.79 [0.75-0.83] (HAI), and 0.79 [0.75-0.83] and 0.76 [0.71-0.76] (SSI) for internal and external testing. Cost-effective analysis shows that the GNN modeling dominated the standard LoS model strategy on the basis of lower mean costs ($1651 vs $1915). DISCUSSION: The proposed HAI risk prediction model can estimate individualized risk of infection for patient by taking into account not only the patient's clinical features, but also clinical features of similar patients as indicated by edges of the patients' graph. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model could allow prevention or earlier detection of HAI, which in turn could decrease hospital LoS and associated mortality, and ultimately reduce the healthcare cost. © The Author(s) 2023.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dedicated expert group participating in the German Medical Informatics Initiative reviewed information contained in MolGen reports, determined the key elements, and formulated a dataset definition. HL7's Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide (IG) was adopted as a basis for the FHIR® specification which was subjected to a public ballot. In addition, elements in the MolGen dataset were mapped to the fields defined in ISO/TS 20428:2017 standard to evaluate compliance. RESULTS: A core dataset of 76 data elements, clustered into 6 categories was created to represent all key information of German MolGen reports. Based on this, a FHIR specification with 16 profiles, 14 derived from HL7®'s Genomics Reporting IG and 2 additional profiles (of the FamilyMemberHistory and RiskAssessment resources), was developed. Five example resource bundles show how our adaptation of an international standard can be used to model MolGen report data that was requested following oncological or rare disease indications. Furthermore, the map of the MolGen report data elements to the fields defined by the ISO/TC 20428:2017 standard, confirmed the presence of the majority of required fields. CONCLUSIONS: Our report serves as a template for other research initiatives attempting to create a standard format for unstructured genomic report data.

We investigated the mechanism of missingness for DR severity based on ICD coding using the American Academy of Ophthalmology IRIS® Registry. We included all patient encounters in the registry with a DR ICD-9 or ICD-10 code between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2021. Demographic, clinical, and practice-level characteristics were compared between encounters with specified and unspecified disease severity. Practices were divided into quartiles based on the proportion of clinical encounters with unspecified DR severity. Encounters with unspecified disease severity were associated with significantly older patient age, better visual acuity, and lower utilization of ophthalmic procedures. Higher volume practices and retina specialist practices had lower proportions of clinical encounters with unspecified disease severity. Results strongly suggest that DR disease severity related to ICD coding is missing not at random. © The Author(s) 2023.

METHODS: Using a previously unvalidated algorithm of identifying TGD persons within administrative claims data in a multistep, hierarchical process, we validated this algorithm in an EHR data set with self-reported gender identity. RESULTS: Within an EHR data set of 52 746 adults with self-reported gender identity (gold standard) a previously unvalidated algorithm to identify TGD persons via TGD-related diagnosis and procedure codes, and gender-affirming hormone therapy prescription data had a sensitivity of 87.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86.4-88.2), specificity of 98.7% (95% CI 98.6-98.8), positive predictive value (PPV) of 88.7% (95% CI 87.9-89.4), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 98.5% (95% CI 98.4-98.6).

We describe a method for phenotype recognition that imputes phenotype codes for all UK Biobank participants.

We extracted phenotypic and health-related information of 392 246 individuals from the UK Biobank for POPDx development and evaluation. A total of 12 803 ICD-10 diagnosis codes of the patients were converted to 1538 phecodes as gold standard labels. The POPDx framework was evaluated and compared to other available methods on automated multiphenotype recognition. RESULTS: POPDx can predict phenotypes that are rare or even unobserved in training. We demonstrate substantial improvement of automated multiphenotype recognition across 22 disease categories, and its application in identifying key epidemiological features associated with each phenotype.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 999 chest X-ray and CT reports collected between November 2019 and November 2020 were annotated for PHI at the token level and combined with 3001 X-rays and 2193 medical notes previously labeled, forming a large multi-institutional and cross-domain dataset of 6193 documents. Two radiology test sets, from a known and a new institution, as well as i2b2 2006 and 2014 test sets, served as an evaluation set to estimate model performance and to compare it with previously released deidentification tools. Several PHI detection models were developed based on different training datasets, fine-tuning approaches and data augmentation techniques, and a synthetic PHI generation algorithm. These models were compared using metrics such as precision, recall and F1 score, as well as paired samples Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS: Our best PHI detection model achieves 97.9 F1 score on radiology reports from a known institution, 99.6 from a new institution, 99.5 on i2b2 2006, and 98.9 on i2b2 2014. On reports from a known institution, it achieves 99.1 recall of detecting the core of each PHI span. DISCUSSION: Our model outperforms all deidentifiers it was compared to on all test sets as well as human labelers on i2b2 2014 data. It enables accurate and automatic deidentification of radiology reports.

High-throughput methods to efficiently identify new medical problems arising after acute medical events using the electronic health record (EHR) could improve surveillance for long-term consequences of acute medical problems like COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We augmented an existing high-throughput phenotyping method (PheWAS) to identify new diagnoses occurring after an acute temporal event in the EHR. We then used the temporal-informed phenotypes to assess development of new medical problems among COVID-19 survivors enrolled in an EHR cohort of adults tested for COVID-19 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. RESULTS: The study cohort included 186 105 adults tested for COVID-19 from March 5, 2020 to November 1, 2021; of which 30 088 (16.2%) tested positive. Median follow-up after testing was 412 days (IQR 274-528). Our temporal-informed phenotyping was able to distinguish phenotype chapters based on chronicity of their constituent diagnoses. PheWAS with temporal-informed phenotypes identified increased risk for 43 diagnoses among COVID-19 survivors during outpatient follow-up, including multiple new respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and pregnancy-related conditions. Findings were robust to sensitivity analyses, and several phenotypic associations were supported by changes in outpatient vital signs or laboratory tests from the pretesting to postrecovery period. CONCLUSION: Temporal-informed PheWAS identified new diagnoses affecting multiple organ systems among COVID-19 survivors. These findings can inform future efforts to enable longitudinal health surveillance for survivors of COVID-19 and other acute medical conditions using the EHR. © The Author(s) 2022.

We reviewed current approaches used to evaluate the costs and consequences of CDSS in hospital settings and presented recommendations to improve the generalizability of future evaluations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A scoping review of peer-reviewed research articles published since 2010. Searches were completed in the PubMed, Ovid Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases (last searched February 14, 2023). All studies reported the costs and consequences of a CDSS-based intervention compared with current hospital workflows. Findings were summarized using narrative synthesis. Individual studies were further appraised against the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation and Reporting (CHEERS) 2022 checklist. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies published since 2010 were included. Studies evaluated CDSS for adverse event surveillance (5 studies), antimicrobial stewardship (4 studies), blood product management (8 studies), laboratory testing (7 studies), and medication safety (5 studies). All studies evaluated costs from a hospital perspective but varied based on the valuation of resources affected by CDSS implementation, and the measurement of consequences. We recommend future studies follow guidance from the CHEERS checklist; use study designs that adjust for confounders; consider both the costs of CDSS implementation and adherence; evaluate consequences that are directly or indirectly affected by CDSS-initiated behavior change; examine the impacts of uncertainty and differences in outcomes across patient subgroups. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Improving consistency in the conduct and reporting of evaluations will enable detailed comparisons between promising initiatives, and their subsequent uptake by decision-makers. © The Author(s) 2023.

One of the core limitations of these transformer models is the substantial memory consumption due to their full self-attention mechanism, which leads to the performance degradation in long clinical texts. To overcome this, we propose to leverage long-sequence transformer models (eg, Longformer and BigBird), which extend the maximum input sequence length from 512 to 4096, to enhance the ability to model long-term dependencies in long clinical texts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inspired by the success of long-sequence transformer models and the fact that clinical notes are mostly long, we introduce 2 domain-enriched language models, Clinical-Longformer and Clinical-BigBird, which are pretrained on a large-scale clinical corpus. We evaluate both language models using 10 baseline tasks including named entity recognition, question answering, natural language inference, and document classification tasks. RESULTS: The results demonstrate that Clinical-Longformer and Clinical-BigBird consistently and significantly outperform ClinicalBERT and other short-sequence transformers in all 10 downstream tasks and achieve new state-of-the-art results. DISCUSSION: Our pretrained language models provide the bedrock for clinical NLP using long texts. We have made our source code available at https://github.com/luoyuanlab/Clinical-Longformer, and the pretrained models available for public download at: https://huggingface.co/yikuan8/Clinical-Longformer. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that clinical knowledge-enriched long-sequence transformers are able to learn long-term dependencies in long clinical text. Our methods can also inspire the development of other domain-enriched long-sequence transformers. © The Author(s) 2022.

However, many patients who could benefit from PC do not receive it early enough or at all. We sought to address this problem by building a predictive model into a comprehensive clinical framework with the aims to (i) identify in-hospital patients likely to benefit from a PC consult, and (ii) intervene on such patients by contacting their care team. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic health record data for 68 349 inpatient encounters in 2017 at a large hospital were used to train a model to predict the need for PC consult. This model was published as a web service, connected to institutional data pipelines, and consumed by a downstream display application monitored by the PC team. For those patients that the PC team deems appropriate, a team member then contacts the patient's corresponding care team. RESULTS: Training performance AUC based on a 20% holdout validation set was 0.90. The most influential variables were previous palliative care, hospital unit, Albumin, Troponin, and metastatic cancer. The model has been successfully integrated into the clinical workflow making real-time predictions on hundreds of patients per day. The model had an ""in-production"" AUC of 0.91. A clinical trial is currently underway to assess the effect on clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning model can effectively predict the need for an inpatient PC consult and has been successfully integrated into practice to refer new patients to PC. © The Author(s) 2021.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This large-scale study included physicians who prescribed at least 100 systemic medications at Sheba Medical Center during 2012-2017 in all acute care departments, excluding intensive care units. Presumed medication errors were flagged by a high-accuracy computerized decision support system that uses machine-learning algorithms to detect potential medication prescription errors. Physicians' successive work shifts (first or only shift, second, and third shifts), workload (assessed by the number of prescriptions during a shift) and work-experience, as well as a novel measurement of physicians' prescribing experience with a specific drug, were assessed per prescription. The risk to err was determined for various work conditions. RESULTS: 1 652 896 medical orders were prescribed by 1066 physicians; The system flagged 3738 (0.23%) prescriptions as erroneous. Physicians were 8.2 times more likely to err during high than normal-low workload shifts (5.19% vs 0.63%, P < .0001). Physicians on their third or second successive shift (compared to a first or single shift) were more likely to err (2.1%, 1.8%, and 0.88%, respectively, P < .001). Lack of experience in prescribing a specific medication was associated with higher error rate (0.37% for the first 5 prescriptions vs 0.13% after over 40, P < .001). DISCUSSION: Longer hours and less experience in prescribing a specific medication increase risk of erroneous prescribing. CONCLUSION: Restricting successive shifts, reducing workload, increasing training and supervision, and implementing smart clinical decision support systems may help reduce prescription errors. © The Author(s) 2020.

Identifying subphenotypes of infected patients is essential for personalized management. It is unknown how different time series clustering algorithms compare in identifying these subphenotypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with suspected infection admitted between 2014 and 2019 to 4 hospitals in Emory healthcare were included, split into separate training and validation cohorts. Dynamic time warping (DTW) was applied to vital signs from the first 8 h of hospitalization, and hierarchical clustering (DTW-HC) and partition around medoids (DTW-PAM) were used to cluster patients into subphenotypes. DTW-HC, DTW-PAM, and a previously published group-based trajectory model (GBTM) were evaluated for agreement in subphenotype clusters, trajectory patterns, and subphenotype associations with clinical outcomes and treatment responses. RESULTS: There were 12 473 patients in training and 8256 patients in validation cohorts. DTW-HC, DTW-PAM, and GBTM models resulted in 4 consistent vitals trajectory patterns with significant agreement in clustering (71-80% agreement, P < .001): group A was hyperthermic, tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypotensive. Group B was hyperthermic, tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypertensive. Groups C and D had lower temperatures, heart rates, and respiratory rates, with group C normotensive and group D hypotensive. Group A had higher odds ratio of 30-day inpatient mortality (P < .01) and group D had significant mortality benefit from balanced crystalloids compared to saline (P < .01) in all 3 models. DISCUSSION: DTW- and GBTM-based clustering algorithms applied to vital signs in infected patients identified consistent subphenotypes with distinct clinical outcomes and treatment responses. CONCLUSION: Time series clustering with distinct computational approaches demonstrate similar performance and significant agreement in the resulting subphenotypes. © The Author(s) 2023.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic health records of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center were temporally sequenced and transformed into patient vector representations using Paragraph Vector models. K-means clustering was performed to identify subgroups. RESULTS: A diverse cohort of 11 313 patients with COVID-19 and hospitalizations between March 2, 2020 and December 1, 2021 were identified; median [IQR] age: 61.2 [40.3-74.3]; 51.5% female. Twenty subgroups of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, labeled by increasing severity, were characterized by their demographics, conditions, outcomes, and severity (mild-moderate/severe/critical). Subgroup temporal patterns were characterized by the durations in each subgroup, transitions between subgroups, and the complete paths throughout the course of hospitalization. DISCUSSION: Several subgroups had mild-moderate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections but were hospitalized for underlying conditions (pregnancy, cardiovascular disease [CVD], etc.). Subgroup 7 included solid organ transplant recipients who mostly developed mild-moderate or severe disease. Subgroup 9 had a history of type-2 diabetes, kidney and CVD, and suffered the highest rates of heart failure (45.2%) and end-stage renal disease (80.6%). Subgroup 13 was the oldest (median: 82.7 years) and had mixed severity but high mortality (33.3%). Subgroup 17 had critical disease and the highest mortality (64.6%), with age (median: 68.1 years) being the only notable risk factor. Subgroups 18-20 had critical disease with high complication rates and long hospitalizations (median: 40+ days). All subgroups are detailed in the full text. A chord diagram depicts the most common transitions, and paths with the highest prevalence, longest hospitalizations, lowest and highest mortalities are presented. Understanding these subgroups and their pathways may aid clinicians in their decisions for better management and earlier intervention for patients. © The Author(s) 2022.

This study aimed to develop and validate a machine-learning model that predicts the cause of death from the patient's last medical checkup. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To classify the mortality status and each individual cause of death, we used a stacking ensemble method. The prediction outcomes were all-cause mortality, 8 leading causes of death in South Korea, and other causes. The clinical data of study populations were extracted from the national claims (n = 174 747) and electronic health records (n = 729 065) and were used for model development and external validation. Moreover, we imputed the cause of death from the data of 3 US claims databases (n = 994 518, 995 372, and 407 604, respectively). All databases were formatted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. RESULTS: The generalized area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the model predicting the cause of death within 60 days was 0.9511. Moreover, the AUROC of the external validation was 0.8887. Among the causes of death imputed in the Medicare Supplemental database, 11.32% of deaths were due to malignant neoplastic disease. DISCUSSION: This study showed the potential of machine-learning models as a new alternative to address the lack of access to cause-of-death data. All processes were disclosed to maintain transparency, and the model was easily applicable to other institutions. CONCLUSION: A machine-learning model with competent performance was developed to predict cause of death. © The Author(s) 2020.

METHODS: Electronic databases were searched using ""digital health,"" ""maturity models,"" and related terms based on the Digital Health Profile and Maturity Assessment Toolkit Maturity Model (DHPMAT-MM). Covidence was used to screen, identify, capture, and achieve consensus on data extracted by the authors. Descriptive statistics were generated. A thematic analysis and conceptual synthesis were conducted. FINDINGS: Diverse domain-specific MMs and model development, implementation, and evaluation methods were found. The spread and pattern of different MMs verified the essential DH foundations and five maturity stages of the DHPMAT-MM. An unanticipated finding was the existence of a new category of community-facing MMs. Common characteristics included:1. A dynamic lifecycle approach to digital capability maturity, which is:a. responsive to environmental changes and may improve or worsen over time;b. accumulative, incorporating the attributes of the preceding stage; andc. sequential, where no maturity stage must be skipped.2. Sociotechnical quality improvement of the DH ecosystem and MM, which includes:a. investing in the organization's human, hardware, and software resources andb. a need to engage and improve the DH competencies of citizens. CONCLUSIONS: The diversity in MMs and variability in methods and content can create cognitive dissonance. A metamodel like the DHPMAT-MM can logically unify the many domain-specific MMs and guide the overall implementation and evaluation of DH ecosystems and MMs over the maturity lifecycle. © The Author(s) 2022.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our representation, EvidenceMap, consists of 3 levels of abstraction: Medical Evidence Entity, Proposition and Map, to represent the hierarchical structure of medical evidence composition. Randomly selected RCT abstracts were annotated following EvidenceMap based on the consensus of 2 independent annotators to train an NLP pipeline. Via a user study, we measured how the EvidenceMap improved evidence comprehension and analyzed its representative capacity by comparing the evidence annotation with EvidenceMap representation and without following any specific guidelines. RESULTS: Two corpora including 229 disease-agnostic and 80 COVID-19 RCT abstracts were annotated, yielding 12 725 entities and 1602 propositions. EvidenceMap saves users 51.9% of the time compared to reading raw-text abstracts. Most evidence elements identified during the freeform annotation were successfully represented by EvidenceMap, and users gave the enrollment, study design, and study Results sections mean 5-scale Likert ratings of 4.85, 4.70, and 4.20, respectively. The end-to-end evaluations of the pipeline show that the evidence proposition formulation achieves F1 scores of 0.84 and 0.86 in the adjusted random index score. CONCLUSIONS: EvidenceMap extends the participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome framework into 3 levels of abstraction for transforming free-text evidence from the clinical literature into a computable structure. It can be used as an interoperable format for better evidence retrieval and synthesis and an interpretable representation to efficiently comprehend RCT findings. © The Author(s) 2023.

Yet, worst-case adversarial modeling can overestimate risk and induce heavy editing of shared data. The objective of this study is to introduce a framework for assessing the risk considering the attacker's resources and capabilities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We integrate 3 established risk measures (ie, prosecutor, journalist, and marketer risks) and compute re-identification probabilities for data subjects. This probability is dependent on an attacker's capabilities (eg, ability to obtain external identified resources) and the subject's decision on whether to reveal their participation in a dataset. We illustrate the framework through case studies using data from over 1 000 000 patients from Vanderbilt University Medical Center and show how re-identification risk changes when attackers are pragmatic and use 2 known resources for attack: (1) voter registration lists and (2) social media posts. RESULTS: Our framework illustrates that the risk is substantially smaller in the pragmatic scenarios than in the worst case. Our experiments yield a median worst-case risk of 0.987 (where 0 is least risky and 1 is most risky); however, the median reduction in risk was 90.1% in the voter registration scenario and 100% in the social media posts scenario. Notably, these observations hold true for a wide range of adversarial capabilities. CONCLUSIONS: This research illustrates that re-identification risk is situationally dependent and that appropriate adversarial modeling may permit biomedical data sharing on a wider scale than is currently the case. © The Author(s) 2021.

We sought to describe hospital leaders' perceptions of the prevalence of practices that may constitute information blocking, by actor and hospital characteristics, following the rule's applicability date. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of a national survey of hospitals fielded in 2021. The analytic sample included 2092 nonfederal acute care hospitals in the United States. We present descriptive statistics on the perception of the prevalence of information blocking and results of multivariate regression models examining the association between hospital, health information technology (IT) developer and market characteristics and the perception of information blocking. RESULTS: Overall, 42% of hospitals reported observing some behavior they perceived to be information blocking. Thirty-six percent of responding hospitals perceived that healthcare providers either sometimes or often engaged in practices that may constitute information blocking, while 17% and 19% perceived that health IT developers (such as EHR developers) and State, regional and/or local health information exchanges did the same, respectively. Prevalence varied by health IT developer market share, hospital for-profit status, and health system market share. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results support the value of efforts to further reduce friction in the exchange of EHI and support the need for continued observation to provide a sense of the prevalence of information blocking practices and for education and awareness of information blocking regulations.

We performed a scoping review of database-specific RWD applications within clinical trial contexts, synthesizing prominent uses and themes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Querying 3 biomedical literature databases, research articles using electronic health records, administrative claims databases, or clinical registries either within a clinical trial or in tandem with methodology related to clinical trials were included. Articles were required to use at least 1 US RWD source. All abstract screening, full-text screening, and data extraction was performed by 1 reviewer. Two reviewers independently verified all decisions. RESULTS: Of 2020 screened articles, 89 qualified: 59 articles used electronic health records, 29 used administrative claims, and 26 used registries. Our synthesis was driven by the general life cycle of a clinical trial, culminating into 3 major themes: trial process tasks (51 articles); dissemination strategies (6); and generalizability assessments (34). Despite a diverse set of diseases studied, <10% of trials using RWD for trial process tasks evaluated medications or procedures (5/51). All articles highlighted data-related challenges, such as missing values. DISCUSSION: Database-specific RWD have been occasionally leveraged for various clinical trial tasks. We observed underuse of RWD within conducted medication or procedure trials, though it is subject to the confounder of implicit report of RWD use. CONCLUSION: Enhanced incorporation of RWD should be further explored for medication or procedure trials, including better understanding of how to handle related data quality issues to facilitate RWD use. © The Author(s) 2020.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used software tools and manual reviews to estimate the rate of LOINC mapping errors among 179 million mapped test results from 2 DataMarts in PCORnet. We separately reported unweighted and weighted mapping error rates, overall and by parts of the LOINC term. RESULTS: Of included 179 537 986 mapped results for 3029 quantitative tests, 95.4% were mapped correctly implying an 4.6% mapping error rate. Error rates were less than 5% for the more common tests with at least 100 000 mapped test results. Mapping errors varied across different LOINC classes. Error rates in chemistry and hematology classes, which together accounted for 92.0% of the mapped test results, were 0.4% and 7.5%, respectively. About 50% of mapping errors were due to errors in the property part of the LOINC name. DISCUSSIONS: Mapping errors could be detected automatically through inconsistencies in (1) qualifiers of the analyte, (2) specimen type, (3) property, and (4) method. Among quantitative test results, which are the large majority of reported tests, application of automatic error detection and correction algorithm could reduce the mapping errors further. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the mapping error rate within the PCORnet data was 4.6%. This is nontrivial but less than other published error rates of 20%-40%. Such error rate decreased substantially to 0.1% after the application of automatic detection and correction algorithm.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, ACM Digital, Embase, CINAHL Complete, PsycINFO, and Web of Science from January 2010 to June 2021 for studies evaluating the performance of automated methods to detect HIT problems. HIT problems were reviewed using an existing classification for safety concerns. Automated methods were categorized into rule-based, statistical, and machine learning methods, and their performance in detecting HIT problems was assessed. The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews statement. RESULTS: Of the 45 studies identified, the majority (n = 27, 60%) focused on detecting use errors involving electronic health records and order entry systems. Machine learning (n = 22) and statistical modeling (n = 17) were the most common methods. Unsupervised learning was used to detect use errors in laboratory test results, prescriptions, and patient records while supervised learning was used to detect technical errors arising from hardware or software issues. Statistical modeling was used to detect use errors, unauthorized access, and clinical decision support system malfunctions while rule-based methods primarily focused on use errors. CONCLUSIONS: A wide variety of rule-based, statistical, and machine learning methods have been applied to automate the detection of safety problems with HIT. Many opportunities remain to systematically study their application and effectiveness in real-world settings. © The Author(s) 2022.

In this study, we evaluated the performance over time of a machine learning, electronic health record-based mortality prediction algorithm currently used in clinical practice to identify patients with cancer who may benefit from early advance care planning conversations. We show that during the pandemic period, algorithm identification of high-risk patients had a substantial and sustained decline. Decreases in laboratory utilization during the peak of the pandemic may have contributed to drift. Calibration and overall discrimination did not markedly decline during the pandemic. This argues for careful attention to the performance and retraining of predictive algorithms that use inputs from the pandemic period. © The Author(s) 2022.

For predicting life expectancy, physicians have been shown to outperform traditional models that use only a few predictor variables. It is possible that a machine learning model that uses many predictor variables and diverse data sources from the electronic medical record can improve on physicians' performance. For patients with metastatic cancer, we compared accuracy of life expectancy predictions by the treating physician, a machine learning model, and a traditional model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A machine learning model was trained using 14 600 metastatic cancer patients' data to predict each patient's distribution of survival time. Data sources included note text, laboratory values, and vital signs. From 2015-2016, 899 patients receiving radiotherapy for metastatic cancer were enrolled in a study in which their radiation oncologist estimated life expectancy. Survival predictions were also made by the machine learning model and a traditional model using only performance status. Performance was assessed with area under the curve for 1-year survival and calibration plots. RESULTS: The radiotherapy study included 1190 treatment courses in 899 patients. A total of 879 treatment courses in 685 patients were included in this analysis. Median overall survival was 11.7 months. Physicians, machine learning model, and traditional model had area under the curve for 1-year survival of 0.72 (95% CI 0.63-0.81), 0.77 (0.73-0.81), and 0.68 (0.65-0.71), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning model's predictions were more accurate than those of the treating physician or a traditional model. © The Author(s) 2020.

A framework called the information value chain, which connects technology use to final outcome, was used to assess how IT problems affect user interaction, information receipt, decision-making, care processes, and patient outcomes. The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.; Results: Of the 34 studies identified, the majority ( n  = 14, 41%) were analyses of incidents reported from 6 countries. There were 7 descriptive studies, 9 ethnographic studies, and 4 case reports. The types of IT problems were similar to those described in earlier classifications of safety problems associated with health IT. The frequency, scale, and severity of IT problems were not adequately captured within these studies. Use errors and poor user interfaces interfered with the receipt of information and led to errors of commission when making decisions. Clinical errors involving medications were well characterized. Issues with system functionality, including poor user interfaces and fragmented displays, delayed care delivery. Issues with system access, system configuration, and software updates also delayed care. In 18 studies (53%), IT problems were linked to patient harm and death. Near-miss events were reported in 10 studies (29%).; Discussion and conclusion: The research evidence describing problems with health IT remains largely qualitative, and many opportunities remain to systematically study and quantify risks and benefits with regard to patient safety. The information value chain, when used in conjunction with existing classifications for health IT safety problems, can enhance measurement and should facilitate identification of the most significant risks to patient safety.","Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Medical Errors; Medical Informatics; Patient Safety; Treatment Outcome; health care delivery; human; medical error; medical informatics; patient safety; treatment outcome","","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049361195"

Interest in CI training opportunities (medical school electives, residency electives, or academic fellowships) surpassed respondents' prior awareness of these opportunities. Thirty percent of student respondents expressed at least some interest in a CI-related career, but they were no more aware of training opportunities than their peers who did not express such an interest.; DISCUSSION: Almost one third of medical students who responded to our survey expressed an interest in a CI-related career, but they were generally unaware of CI training and mentoring opportunities available to them. Early outreach to such medical students, through elective classes, professional society incentives, or expert partnerships, may positively influence the size and skill set of the future CI workforce.; CONCLUSION: We should work as a field to increase the quantity, quality, and publicity of CI learning opportunities for interested medical students. © The Author 2015.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 300 commonly used codes each from SNOMED CT, ICD-10-PCS, and CCI (Canadian Classification of Health Interventions) and mapped them to ICHI. We evaluated the level of match at the ICHI stem code and Foundation Component levels. We used postcoordination (modification of existing codes by adding other codes) to improve matching. Failure analysis was done for cases where full representation was not achieved. We noted and categorized potential problems that we encountered in ICHI, which could affect the accuracy and consistency of mapping. RESULTS: Overall, among the 900 codes from the 3 sources, 286 (31.8%) had full match with ICHI stem codes, 222 (24.7%) had full match with Foundation entities, and 231 (25.7%) had full match with postcoordination. 143 codes (15.9%) could only be partially represented even with postcoordination. A small number of SNOMED CT and ICD-10-PCS codes (18 codes, 2% of total), could not be mapped because the source codes were underspecified. We noted 4 categories of problems in ICHI-redundancy, missing elements, modeling issues, and naming issues. CONCLUSION: Using the full range of mapping options, at least three-quarters of the commonly used codes in each source system achieved a full match.

Labeled data are critical to training and testing DL models, but human expert labelers are limited. In addition, DL traditionally requires copious training data, which is computationally expensive to process and iterate over. Consequently, it is useful to prioritize using those images that are most likely to improve a model's performance, a practice known as instance selection. The challenge is determining how best to prioritize. It is natural to prefer straightforward, robust, quantitative metrics as the basis for prioritization for instance selection. However, in current practice, such metrics are not tailored to, and almost never used for, image datasets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address this problem, we introduce ENRICH-Eliminate Noise and Redundancy for Imaging Challenges-a customizable method that prioritizes images based on how much diversity each image adds to the training set. RESULTS: First, we show that medical datasets are special in that in general each image adds less diversity than in nonmedical datasets. Next, we demonstrate that ENRICH achieves nearly maximal performance on classification and segmentation tasks on several medical image datasets using only a fraction of the available images and without up-front data labeling. ENRICH outperforms random image selection, the negative control. Finally, we show that ENRICH can also be used to identify errors and outliers in imaging datasets. CONCLUSIONS: ENRICH is a simple, computationally efficient method for prioritizing images for expert labeling and use in DL. © The Author(s) 2023.

Given the high attributes of abuse and dependency, prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) were introduced in the United States as a state-level intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using cross-sectional data from the 2019 National Electronic Health Records Survey, we assessed the association between PDMP usage and reduced or eliminated controlled substance prescribing as well as the association between PDMP usage and changing a controlled substance prescription to a nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or nonpharmacologic therapy. We applied survey weights to produce physician-level estimates from the survey sample. RESULTS: Adjusting for physician age, sex, type of medical degree, specialty, and ease of PDMP, we found that physicians who reported ""often"" PDMP usage had 2.34 times the odds of reducing or eliminating controlled substance prescriptions compared to physicians who reported never using the PDMP (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-4.90). Adjusting for physician age, sex, type of doctor, and specialty, we found that physicians who reported ""often"" use of the PDMP had 3.65 times the odd of changing controlled substance prescriptions to a nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or nonpharmacologic therapy (95% CI: 1.61-8.26). DISCUSSION: These results support the continued use, investment, and expansion of PDMPs as an effective intervention for reducing controlled substance prescription and changing to nonopioid/pharmacologic therapy. CONCLUSION: Overall, frequent usage of PDMPs was significantly associated with reducing, eliminating, or changing controlled substance prescription patterns. © The Author(s) 2023.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Override rate frequency was recorded for all inpatients who had a renal CDS alert trigger between 05/2017 and 04/2018. Two random samples of 300 for each of 2 types of medication-related CDS alerts associated with renal insufficiency-""dose change"" and ""avoid medication""-were evaluated by 2 independent reviewers using predetermined criteria for appropriateness of alert trigger, appropriateness of override, and patient harm. RESULTS: We identified 37 100 ""dose change"" and 5095 ""avoid medication"" alerts in the population evaluated, and 100% of each were overridden. Dose change triggers were classified as 12.5% appropriate and overrides of these alerts classified as 90.5% appropriate. Avoid medication triggers were classified as 29.6% appropriate and overrides 76.5% appropriate. We identified 5 adverse drug events, and, of these, 4 of the 5 were due to inappropriately overridden alerts. CONCLUSION: Alerts were nearly always presented inappropriately and were all overridden during the 1-year period studied. Alert fatigue resulting from receiving too many poor-quality alerts may result in failure to recognize errors that could lead to patient harm. Although medication-related CDS alerts associated with renal insufficiency had previously been found to be the most clinically beneficial alerts in a legacy system, in this system they were ineffective. These findings underscore the need for improvements in alert design, implementation, and monitoring of alert performance to make alerts more patient-specific and clinically appropriate. © The Author(s) 2021.

While early phenotyping relied on rule-based algorithms curated by experts, machine learning (ML) approaches have emerged as an alternative to improve scalability across phenotypes and healthcare settings. This study evaluates ML-based phenotyping with respect to (1) the data sources used, (2) the phenotypes considered, (3) the methods applied, and (4) the reporting and evaluation methods used. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed and Web of Science for articles published between 2018 and 2022. After screening 850 articles, we recorded 37 variables on 100 studies. RESULTS: Most studies utilized data from a single institution and included information in clinical notes. Although chronic conditions were most commonly considered, ML also enabled the characterization of nuanced phenotypes such as social determinants of health. Supervised deep learning was the most popular ML paradigm, while semi-supervised and weakly supervised learning were applied to expedite algorithm development and unsupervised learning to facilitate phenotype discovery. ML approaches did not uniformly outperform rule-based algorithms, but deep learning offered a marginal improvement over traditional ML for many conditions. DISCUSSION: Despite the progress in ML-based phenotyping, most articles focused on binary phenotypes and few articles evaluated external validity or used multi-institution data. Study settings were infrequently reported and analytic code was rarely released. CONCLUSION: Continued research in ML-based phenotyping is warranted, with emphasis on characterizing nuanced phenotypes, establishing reporting and evaluation standards, and developing methods to accommodate misclassified phenotypes due to algorithm errors in downstream applications. © The Author(s) 2022.

We developed machine-learning models to detect CKD without blood collection, predicting an eGFR less than 60 (eGFR60 model) or 45 (eGFR45 model) using a urine dipstick test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The electronic health record data (n = 220 018) obtained from university hospitals were used for XGBoost-derived model construction. The model variables were age, sex, and 10 measurements from the urine dipstick test. The models were validated using health checkup center data (n = 74 380) and nationwide public data (KNHANES data, n = 62 945) for the general population in Korea. RESULTS: The models comprised 7 features, including age, sex, and 5 urine dipstick measurements (protein, blood, glucose, pH, and specific gravity). The internal and external areas under the curve (AUCs) of the eGFR60 model were 0.90 or higher, and a higher AUC for the eGFR45 model was obtained. For the eGFR60 model on KNHANES data, the sensitivity was 0.93 or 0.80, and the specificity was 0.86 or 0.85 in ages less than 65 with proteinuria (nondiabetes or diabetes, respectively). Nonproteinuric CKD could be detected in nondiabetic patients under the age of 65 with a sensitivity of 0.88 and specificity of 0.71. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The model performance differed across subgroups by age, proteinuria, and diabetes. The CKD progression risk can be assessed with the eGFR models using the levels of eGFR decrease and proteinuria. The machine-learning-enhanced urine-dipstick test can become a point-of-care test to promote public health by screening CKD and ranking its risk of progression. © The Author(s) 2023.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using nationally representative survey data from 2019 and 2020 (N = 8028), we examined disparities in patients being offered access to a portal by their provider and differences in subsequent access and use. Using multivariable models, we estimated the effect of race and ethnicity on the likelihood of being offered, accessing or using a portal. Among those offered, we examined the relationship between provider encouragement and portal access; and for those who did not access their portal, we explored reasons for nonuse. RESULTS: Black and Hispanic individuals were offered and accessed patient portals at significantly lower rates than White individuals. Compared to Whites, Black and Hispanic individuals were 5.2 percentage-points less likely to be offered a portal (P < .05) and, among those offered, 7.9 percentage-points less likely to access their portal (P < .05). Black and Hispanic individuals who were offered and accessed a portal were 12 percentage-points more likely than Whites to use it to download or transmit information (P < .01). Individuals who were offered a portal and encouraged to use it were 21 percentage-points more likely to access it. DISCUSSION: Differences in patient portal access and use are likely driven by disparities in which groups of patients reported being offered a portal.

We designed a Question Answering (QA) system capable of answering ad-hoc questions about the COVID-19 disease, its causal virus SARS-CoV-2, and the recommended response to the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The QA system incorporates, in addition to relevance models, automatic generation of questions from relevant sentences. We relied on entailment between questions for (1) pinpointing answers and (2) selecting novel answers early in the list of its results. RESULTS: The QA system produced state-of-the-art results when processing questions asked by experts (eg, researchers, scientists, or clinicians) and competitive results when processing questions asked by consumers of health information. Although state-of-the-art models for question generation and question entailment were used, more than half of the answers were missed, due to the limitations of the relevance models employed. DISCUSSION: Although question entailment enabled by automatic question generation is the cornerstone of our QA system's architecture, question entailment did not prove to always be reliable or sufficient in ranking the answers. Question entailment should be enhanced with additional inferential capabilities. CONCLUSION: The QA system presented in this article produced state-of-the-art results processing expert questions and competitive results processing consumer questions. Improvements should be considered by using better relevance models and enhanced inference methods. Moreover, experts and consumers have different answer expectations, which should be accounted for in future QA development. © The Author(s) 2022.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We preprocessed 9166 COVID-19 Structured Query Language (SQL) code, summary statistics, and user activity logs, from the GitHub repository of the Reliable Response Data Discovery for COVID-19 (R2D2) Consortium. The repository collected local summary statistics from participating institutions and aggregated the global result to a COVID-19-related clinical query, previously posted by clinicians on a website. We developed both on-chain and off-chain components to store/query these activity logs and their associated queries/results on a blockchain for immutability, transparency, and high availability of research communication. We measured run-time efficiency of contract deployment, network transactions, and confirmed the accuracy of recorded logs compared to a centralized baseline solution. RESULTS: The smart contract deployment took 4.5 s on an average. The time to record an activity log on blockchain was slightly over 2 s, versus 5-9 s for baseline. For querying, each query took on an average less than 0.4 s on blockchain, versus around 2.1 s for baseline. DISCUSSION: The low deployment, recording, and querying times confirm the feasibility of our cross-cloud, blockchain-based federated data analysis system. We have yet to evaluate the system on a larger network with multiple nodes per cloud, to consider how to accommodate a surge in activities, and to investigate methods to lower querying time as the blockchain grows.

RESULTS: 37 857 physicians decreased either note length (n = 15 647), time in notes (n = 15 417), or both (n = 6793). Note length decreases were primarily attributable to reductions in copy/paste text (average relative change of -18.9%) and templated text (-17.2%). Note time decreases were primarily attributable to reductions in manual text (-27.3%) and increases in note content from other care team members (+21.1%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A nonblinded randomized controlled trial was conducted (NCT03984929). Participants at least 18 years old living in Washington Heights/Inwood, New York, were recruited from the community between July 2019 and August 2020 and randomized 1:1 to either the intervention group (localization of MedlinePlus resources customized with community components) or the control group (no localized community components). The primary outcome, patient activation, and secondary outcomes, knowledge, self-efficacy, and behavior change, were collected through surveys at 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 134 participants recruited, 50.7% (n = 68) completed the 1-month follow-up. We found no statistically significant differences in the sociodemographic and baseline characteristics between those who missed the 1-month survey and those who completed it. No significant differences were observed in patient activation at 1-month. However, patient activation among all participants (n = 68) significantly increased (P = .048). Statistically significant improvements were also found in self-efficacy (P < .03). In multivariate analysis, birth country outside the United States and higher self-rated attachment to the community emerged as significant predictors of higher patient activation scores. DISCUSSION: While the trial did not detect significant differences between groups, all participants demonstrated increased patient activation scores and improved secondary outcomes. While other factors may have contributed to this increase, our study suggests that access to carefully selected high-quality health information materials delivered digitally in the context of a community may result in improvements comparable to localized content in a hard-to-reach urban Hispanic population. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the potential of making carefully selected digital information accessible to hard-to-reach communities. © The Author(s) 2022.

These problems of variance affect interpretability and usability of clinical encounter data for analysis. These problems are magnified when multisite electronic health record (EHR) data are networked together. This article presents a novel, generalizable method for resolving encounter heterogeneity for analysis by combining related atomic encounters into composite ""macrovisits."" MATERIALS AND METHODS: Encounters were composed of data from 75 partner sites harmonized to a common data model as part of the NIH Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery Initiative, a project of the National Covid Cohort Collaborative. Summary statistics were computed for overall and site-level data to assess issues and identify modifications. Two algorithms were developed to refine atomic encounters into cleaner, analyzable longitudinal clinical visits. RESULTS: Atomic inpatient encounters data were found to be widely disparate between sites in terms of length-of-stay (LOS) and numbers of OMOP CDM measurements per encounter. After aggregating encounters to macrovisits, LOS and measurement variance decreased. A subsequent algorithm to identify hospitalized macrovisits further reduced data variability. DISCUSSION: Encounters are a complex and heterogeneous component of EHR data and native data issues are not addressed by existing methods. These types of complex and poorly studied issues contribute to the difficulty of deriving value from EHR data, and these types of foundational, large-scale explorations, and developments are necessary to realize the full potential of modern real-world data. CONCLUSION: This article presents method developments to manipulate and resolve EHR encounter data issues in a generalizable way as a foundation for future research and analysis. © The Author(s) 2023.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We develop/synthesize the main components of quEHRy: concept normalization (MetaMap), time frame classification (new), semantic parsing (existing), visualization with question understanding (new), and query module for FHIR mapping/processing (new). We evaluate quEHRy on 2 clinical question answering (QA) datasets. We evaluate each component separately as well as holistically to gain deeper insights. We also conduct a thorough error analysis for a crucial subcomponent, medical concept normalization. RESULTS: Using gold concepts, the precision of quEHRy is 98.33% and 90.91% for the 2 datasets, while the overall accuracy was 97.41% and 87.75%. Precision was 94.03% and 87.79% even after employing an automated medical concept extraction system (MetaMap). Most incorrectly predicted medical concepts were broader in nature than gold-annotated concepts (representative of the ones present in EHRs), eg, Diabetes versus Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent. DISCUSSION: The primary performance barrier to deployment of the system is due to errors in medical concept extraction (a component not studied in this article), which affects the downstream generation of correct logical structures. This indicates the need to build QA-specific clinical concept normalizers that understand EHR context to extract the ""relevant"" medical concepts from questions. CONCLUSION: We present an end-to-end QA system that allows information access from EHRs using natural language and returns an exact, verifiable answer. Our proposed system is high-precision and interpretable, checking off the requirements for clinical use. © The Author(s) 2023.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use the electronic health records of 169 434 patients with diabetes, hypertension, and/or lipid disorder. Patients are partitioned into 7 subcohorts based on their comorbidities. DK-CNN integrates both domain knowledge and disease trajectory of patients over multiple visits to retrieve similar patients. We use normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) and macrovascular complication prediction performance to evaluate the effectiveness of DK-CNN compared to state-of-the-art models. Ablation studies are conducted to compare DK-CNN with reduced models that do not use domain knowledge as well as models that do not consider short-term, medium-term, and long-term trajectory over multiple visits. RESULTS: Key findings from this study are: (1) DK-CNN is able to retrieve clinically similar patients and achieves the highest nDCG values in all 7 subcohorts; (2) DK-CNN outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of complication prediction performance in all 7 subcohorts; and (3) the ablation studies show that the full model achieves the highest nDCG compared with other 2 reduced models. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: DK-CNN is a deep learning-based approach which incorporates domain knowledge and patient trajectory data to retrieve clinically similar patients. It can be used to assist physicians who may refer to the outcomes and past treatments of similar patients as a guide for choosing an effective treatment for patients. © The Author(s) 2022.

Although validation of each patient returned by e-phenotype could ensure accuracy of cohort representation, this approach is not practical. Understanding the factors leading to successful e-phenotype specification may reveal generalizable strategies leading to better results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Noninformaticist experts (n = 21) were recruited to produce expert-mediated e-phenotypes using i2b2 assisted by a honest data-broker and a project coordinator. Patient- and visit-sets were reidentified and a random sample of 20 charts matching each e-phenotype was returned to experts for chart-validation. Attributes of the queries and expert characteristics were captured and related to chart-validation rates using generalized linear regression models. RESULTS: E-phenotype validation rates varied according to experts' domains and query characteristics (mean = 61%, range 20-100%). Clinical domains that performed better included infectious, rheumatic, neonatal, and cancers, whereas other domains performed worse (psychiatric, GI, skin, and pulmonary). Match-rate was negatively impacted when specification of temporal constraints was required. In general, the increase in e-phenotype specificity contributed positively to match-rate. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Clinical experts and informaticists experience a variety of challenges when building e-phenotypes, including the inability to differentiate clinical events from patient characteristics or appropriately configure temporal constraints; a lack of access to available and quality data; and difficulty in specifying routes of medication administration. Biomedical query mediation by informaticists and honest data-brokers in designing e-phenotypes cannot be overstated. Although tools such as i2b2 may be widely available to noninformaticists, successful utilization depends not on users' confidence, but rather on creating highly specific e-phenotypes. © The Author(s) 2022.

Existing cutpoint selection approaches typically optimize test-specific metrics, including sensitivity and specificity, but overlook the consequences of correct or incorrect classification. We introduce a new cutpoint selection approach considering downstream consequences using net monetary benefit (NMB) and through simulations compared it with alternative approaches in 2 use-cases: (i) preventing intensive care unit readmission and (ii) preventing inpatient falls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Parameter estimates for costs and effectiveness from prior studies were included in Monte Carlo simulations. For each use-case, we simulated the expected NMB resulting from the model-guided decision using a range of cutpoint selection approaches, including our new value-optimizing approach. Sensitivity analyses applied alternative event rates, model discrimination, and calibration performance. RESULTS: The proposed approach that considered expected downstream consequences was frequently NMB-maximizing compared with other methods. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that it was or closely tracked the optimal strategy under a range of scenarios. Under scenarios of relatively low event rates and discrimination that may be considered realistic for intensive care (prevalence = 0.025, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.70) and falls (prevalence = 0.036, AUC = 0.70), our proposed cutpoint method was either the best or similar to the best of the compared methods regarding NMB, and was robust to model miscalibration. DISCUSSION: Our results highlight the potential value of conditioning cutpoints on the implementation setting, particularly for rare and costly events, which are often the target of prediction model development research. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes a cutpoint selection method that may optimize clinical decision support systems toward value-based care. © The Author(s) 2023.

However, inadequate attention has been paid to the process of selecting and buying systems. The diversity of CDSSs, coupled with research obstacles, marketplace limitations, and legal impediments, has thwarted comparative outcome studies and reduced the availability of reliable information and advice for purchasers. We review these limitations and recommend several comparative studies, which were conducted in phases; studies conducted in phases and focused on limited outcomes of safety, efficacy, and implementation in varied clinical settings. Additionally, we recommend the increased availability of guidance tools to assist purchasers with evidence-based purchases. Transparency is necessary in purchasers' reporting of system defects and vendors' disclosure of marketing conflicts of interest to support methodologically sound studies. Taken together, these measures can foster the evolution of evidence-based tools that, in turn, will enable and empower system purchasers to make wise choices and improve the care of patients.  © The Author 2015.

Although prior research has identified these subphenotypes, the temporal pattern of multiple clinical features has not been considered in cluster models. We aimed to identify temporal subphenotypes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 using a novel sequence cluster analysis and associate them with clinically relevant outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 1036 confirmed critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection admitted to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York city. The agglomerative hierarchical clustering method was used with Levenshtein distance and Ward's minimum variance linkage. RESULTS: We identified four subphenotypes. Subphenotype I (N = 233 [22.5%]) included patients with rapid respirations and a rapid heartbeat but less need for invasive interventions within the first 24 hours, along with a relatively good prognosis. Subphenotype II (N = 418 [40.3%]) represented patients with the least degree of ailments, relatively low mortality, and the highest probability of discharge from the hospital. Subphenotype III (N = 259 [25.0%]) represented patients who experienced clinical deterioration during the first 24 hours of intensive care unit admission, leading to poor outcomes. Subphenotype IV (N = 126 [12.2%]) represented an acute respiratory distress syndrome trajectory with an almost universal need for mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: We utilized the sequence cluster analysis to identify clinical subphenotypes in critically ill COVID-19 patients who had distinct temporal patterns and different clinical outcomes. This study points toward the utility of including temporal information in subphenotyping approaches. © The Author(s) 2021.

Numerous preference card improvement projects have relied on institution-specific, manual approaches of limited reproducibility. We developed and tested an algorithm to facilitate the first automated, informatics-based, fully reproducible approach. METHODS: The algorithm cross-references the supplies used in each procedure and listed on each preference card and uses a time-series regression to estimate the likelihood that each quantity listed on the preference card is inaccurate. Algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring changes in direct costs between preference cards revised with the algorithm and preference cards that were not revised or revised without use of the algorithm. Results were evaluated with a difference-in-differences (DID) multivariate fixed-effects model of costs during an 8-month pre-intervention and a 15-month post-intervention period. RESULTS: The accuracies of the quantities of 469 155 surgeon-procedure-specific items were estimated. Nurses used these estimates to revise 309 preference cards across eight surgical services corresponding to, respectively, 1777 and 3106 procedures in the pre- and post-intervention periods. The average direct cost of supplies per case decreased by 8.38% ($352, SD $6622) for the intervention group and increased by 13.21% ($405, SD $14 706) for the control group (P < .001). The DID analysis showed significant cost reductions only in the intervention group during the intervention period (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The optimization of preference cards with a variety of institution-specific, manually intensive approaches has led to cost savings. The automated algorithm presented here produced similar results that may be more readily reproducible. © The Author(s) 2021.
