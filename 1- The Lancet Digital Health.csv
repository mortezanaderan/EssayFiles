Decentralised clinical trials involve many digital tools to facilitate research without physical contact between research teams and participants at various stages, such as recruitment, enrolment, informed consent, administering study interventions, obtaining patient-reported outcome measures, and safety monitoring. These tools can provide ways of ensuring participants' safety and research integrity, while sometimes reducing participant burden and trial cost. Research sponsors and investigators are interested in expanding the use of decentralised clinical trials. The US Food and Drug Administration and other regulators worldwide have issued guidance on how to implement such adaptations. However, there has been little focus on the distinct ethical challenges these trials pose. In this Health Policy report, which is informed by both traditional research ethics and digital ethics frameworks, we group the related ethical issues under three areas requiring increased ethical vigilance: participants' safety and rights, scientific validity, and ethics oversight. Our aim is to describe these issues, offer practical means of addressing them, and prompt the delineation of ethical standards for decentralised trials. © 2023 The Author(s).

This systematic review identifies DHIs for postoperative monitoring and evaluates their readiness for implementation into routine health care. Studies were defined according to idea, development, exploration, assessment, and long-term follow-up (IDEAL) stages of innovation. A novel clinical innovation network analysis used coauthorship and citations to examine collaboration and progression within the field. 126 DHIs were identified, with 101 (80%) being early stage innovations (IDEAL stage 1 and 2a). None of the DHIs identified had large-scale routine implementation. There is little evidence of collaboration, and there are clear omissions in the evaluation of feasibility, accessibility, and the health-care impact. Use of DHIs for postoperative monitoring remains at an early stage of innovation, with promising but generally low-quality supporting evidence.

However, how frailty affects and is affected by numerous other factors, including mental health and brain structure, remains underexplored. We aimed to investigate the mutual effects of frailty and health using large, multidimensional data. Methods: For this population-based study, we used data from the UK Biobank to examine the pattern and direction of association between physical frailty and 325 health-related measures across multiple domains, using linear mixed-effect models and adjusting for numerous confounders. Participants were included if complete data were available for all five indicators of frailty, all covariates, and at least one health measure. We further examined the association between frailty and brain structure and the role of this association in mediating the relationship between frailty and health outcomes. Findings: 483 033 participants aged 38–73 years were included in the study at baseline (between Dec 19, 2006, and Oct 1, 2010); at a median follow-up of 9 years (IQR 8–10), behavioural data were available for 46 501 participants and neuroimaging data for 40 210 participants. The severity of physical frailty was significantly associated with decreased cognitive performance (Cohen's d=0·025–0·162), increased early-life risks (d=0·026–0·111), unhealthy lifestyle (d=0·013–0·394), poor physical fitness (d=0·007–0·668), increased symptoms of poor mental health (d=0·032–0·607), severe environmental pollution (d=0·013–0·064), and adverse biochemical markers (d=0·025–0·198). Some associations were bidirectional, with the strongest effects on mental health measures. The severity of frailty correlated with increased total white matter hyperintensity and lower grey matter volume, particularly in subcortical regions (d=0·027–0·082), which significantly mediated the association between frailty and health-related outcomes, although the mediated effects were small. Interpretation: Physical frailty is associated with diverse unfavourable health-related outcomes, which can be mediated by differences in brain structure. Our findings offer a framework for guiding preventative strategies targeting both frailty and psychiatric disorders.

We aimed to evaluate the application of machine learning to clinical trials of patients without and with type 2 diabetes to define the personalised cardiovascular benefit of intensive control of systolic blood pressure. Methods: In SPRINT, a trial of intensive (systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg) versus standard (systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg) systolic blood pressure control in patients without type 2 diabetes, we defined a phenotypic representation of the study population using 59 baseline variables. We extracted personalised treatment effect estimates for the primary outcome, time-to-first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and acute decompensated heart failure), through iterative Cox regression analyses providing average hazard ratio (HR) estimates weighted for the phenotypic distance of each participant from the index patient of each iteration. Next, we trained an extreme gradient boosting algorithm (known as XGBoost) to predict the personalised effect of intensive systolic blood pressure control using features most consistently linked to increased personalised benefit, before evaluating its performance in the ACCORD BP trial of patients with type 2 diabetes randomly assigned to receive intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure control. We stratified patients based on their predicted treatment effect, and key demographic groups (age, sex, cardiovascular disease, and smoking). We assessed the presence of heterogeneity with an interaction test, and assessed the performance of the algorithm in a simulation analysis of SPRINT in the presence or absence of an artificially introduced heterogeneous treatment effect. Findings: From SPRINT, we included all 9361 study participants (mean age 67·9 years [SD 9·4], 3332 [35·6%] female) who underwent randomisation to either intensive (n=4678) or standard (n=4683) treatment. The median individualised HR for MACE was 0·63 (IQR 0·53–0·78). An eight-feature tool built for this analysis to predict personalised benefit in SPRINT was externally tested in ACCORD BP (4733 participants (mean age 62·7 years [SD 6·7], 2258 [47·7%] female), wherein it successfully identified individuals with differential benefit from intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure control (adjusted HR for MACE of 0·70 [95% CI 0·55–0·90] in individuals with above-median MACE benefit versus 1·05 [95% CI 0·84–1·32] for below-median predicted benefit; pinteraction=0·0184). Subgroup analysis based on age (<65 years: HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·71–1·12]; ≥65 years: 0·85 [0·67–1·09]), sex (male: 0·89 [0·72–1·10]; female: 0·85 [0·65–1·10]), established cardiovascular disease (no: 0·89 [0·70–1·14]; yes: 0·84 [0·67–1·06]), or active smoking (no: 0·85 [0·71–1·02]; yes: 1·01 [0·64–1·60]) did not identify groups with heterogeneity of treatment effect. In a simulation analysis of SPRINT, the proposed algorithm detected groups with heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence, but not absence, of simulated subgroup differences. Interpretation: By use of machine learning to define an individual's personalised benefit through phenotypic representations of clinical trials, we created a practical tool for individualising the selection of intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure control in patients without and with type 2 diabetes.

We aimed to develop a deep learning algorithm that could use retinal photographs alone, which is the most common method of non-invasive imaging the retina to detect Alzheimer's disease-dementia. Methods: In this retrospective, multicentre case-control study, we trained, validated, and tested a deep learning algorithm to detect Alzheimer's disease-dementia from retinal photographs using retrospectively collected data from 11 studies that recruited patients with Alzheimer's disease-dementia and people without disease from different countries. Our main aim was to develop a bilateral model to detect Alzheimer's disease-dementia from retinal photographs alone. We designed and internally validated the bilateral deep learning model using retinal photographs from six studies. We used the EfficientNet-b2 network as the backbone of the model to extract features from the images. Integrated features from four retinal photographs (optic nerve head-centred and macula-centred fields from both eyes) for each individual were used to develop supervised deep learning models and equip the network with unsupervised domain adaptation technique, to address dataset discrepancy between the different studies. We tested the trained model using five other studies, three of which used PET as a biomarker of significant amyloid β burden (testing the deep learning model between amyloid β positive vs amyloid β negative). Findings: 12 949 retinal photographs from 648 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 3240 people without the disease were used to train, validate, and test the deep learning model. In the internal validation dataset, the deep learning model had 83·6% (SD 2·5) accuracy, 93·2% (SD 2·2) sensitivity, 82·0% (SD 3·1) specificity, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0·93 (0·01) for detecting Alzheimer's disease-dementia. In the testing datasets, the bilateral deep learning model had accuracies ranging from 79·6% (SD 15·5) to 92·1% (11·4) and AUROCs ranging from 0·73 (SD 0·24) to 0·91 (0·10). In the datasets with data on PET, the model was able to differentiate between participants who were amyloid β positive and those who were amyloid β negative: accuracies ranged from 80·6 (SD 13·4%) to 89·3 (13·7%) and AUROC ranged from 0·68 (SD 0·24) to 0·86 (0·16). In subgroup analyses, the discriminative performance of the model was improved in patients with eye disease (accuracy 89·6% [SD 12·5%]) versus those without eye disease (71·7% [11·6%]) and patients with diabetes (81·9% [SD 20·3%]) versus those without the disease (72·4% [11·7%]). Interpretation: A retinal photograph-based deep learning algorithm can detect Alzheimer's disease with good accuracy, showing its potential for screening Alzheimer's disease in a community setting.

The purpose of this Review is to describe the clinical and research gaps in the diagnosis and prognosis of ILD, and how machine learning can be applied to image biomarker research to close these gaps. Machine-learning algorithms can identify ILD in at-risk populations, predict the extent of lung fibrosis, correlate radiological abnormalities with lung function decline, and be used as endpoints in treatment trials, exemplifying how this technology can be used in care for people with ILD. Advances in image processing and analysis provide further opportunities to use machine learning that incorporates deep-learning-based image analysis and radiomics. Collaboration and consistency are required to develop optimal algorithms, and candidate radiological biomarkers should be validated against appropriate predictors of disease outcomes. © 2023 The Author(s).

We aimed to develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted image analysis platform that quantifies cytokine-driven vascular inflammation from routine CT angiograms, and sought to validate its prognostic value in COVID-19. Methods: For this prospective outcomes validation study, we developed a radiotranscriptomic platform that uses RNA sequencing data from human internal mammary artery biopsies to develop novel radiomic signatures of vascular inflammation from CT angiography images. We then used this platform to train a radiotranscriptomic signature (C19-RS), derived from the perivascular space around the aorta and the internal mammary artery, to best describe cytokine-driven vascular inflammation. The prognostic value of C19-RS was validated externally in 435 patients (331 from study arm 3 and 104 from study arm 4) admitted to hospital with or without COVID-19, undergoing clinically indicated pulmonary CT angiography, in three UK National Health Service (NHS) trusts (Oxford, Leicester, and Bath). We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic value of C19-RS for death in hospital due to COVID-19, did sensitivity analyses based on dexamethasone treatment, and investigated the correlation of C19-RS with systemic transcriptomic changes. Findings: Patients with COVID-19 had higher C19-RS than those without (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2·97 [95% CI 1·43–6·27], p=0·0038), and those infected with the B.1.1.7 (alpha) SARS-CoV-2 variant had higher C19-RS values than those infected with the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 variant (adjusted OR 1·89 [95% CI 1·17–3·20] per SD, p=0·012). C19-RS had prognostic value for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 in two testing cohorts (high [≥6·99] vs low [<6·99] C19-RS; hazard ratio [HR] 3·31 [95% CI 1·49–7·33], p=0·0033; and 2·58 [1·10–6·05], p=0·028), adjusted for clinical factors, biochemical biomarkers of inflammation and myocardial injury, and technical parameters. The adjusted HR for in-hospital mortality was 8·24 (95% CI 2·16–31·36, p=0·0019) in patients who received no dexamethasone treatment, but 2·27 (0·69–7·55, p=0·18) in those who received dexamethasone after the scan, suggesting that vascular inflammation might have been a therapeutic target of dexamethasone in COVID-19. Finally, C19-RS was strongly associated (r=0·61, p=0·00031) with a whole blood transcriptional module representing dysregulation of coagulation and platelet aggregation pathways. Interpretation: Radiotranscriptomic analysis of CT angiography scans introduces a potentially powerful new platform for the development of non-invasive imaging biomarkers. Application of this platform in routine CT pulmonary angiography scans done in patients with COVID-19 produced the radiotranscriptomic signature C19-RS, a marker of cytokine-driven inflammation driving systemic activation of coagulation and responsible for adverse clinical outcomes, which predicts in-hospital mortality and might allow targeted therapy.

However, correct selection of stimulation parameters is pivotal to treatment success and currently follows a time-consuming and demanding trial-and-error process. We aimed to assess treatment effects of stimulation parameters suggested by a recently published algorithm (StimFit) based on neuroimaging data. Methods: This double-blind, randomised, crossover, non-inferiority trial was carried out at Charité – Universitätsmedizin, Berlin, Germany, and enrolled patients with Parkinson's disease treated with directional octopolar electrodes targeted at the STN. All patients had undergone DBS programming according to our centre's standard of care (SoC) treatment before study recruitment. Based on perioperative imaging data, DBS electrodes were reconstructed and StimFit was applied to suggest optimal stimulation settings. Patients underwent motor assessments using the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (MDS-UPDRS-III) during OFF-medication and in OFF-stimulation and ON-stimulation states under both conditions, StimFit and SoC parameter settings. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either StimFit-programmed DBS first and SoC-programmed DBS second, or SoC-programmed DBS first and StimFit-programmed DBS second. The allocation schedule was generated using a computerised random number generator. Both the rater and patients were masked to the sequence of SoC and StimFit stimulation conditions. All patients who participated in the study were included in the analysis. The primary endpoint of this study was the absolute mean difference between MDS-UPDRS-III scores under StimFit and SoC stimulation, with a non-inferiority margin of 5 points. The study was registered at the German Register for Clinical Trials (DRKS00023115), and is complete. Findings: Between July 10, 2020, and Oct 28, 2021, 35 patients were enrolled in the study; 18 received StimFit followed by SoC stimulation, and 17 received SoC followed by StimFit stimulation. Mean MDS-UPDRS-III scores improved from 47·3 (SD 17·1) at OFF-stimulation baseline to 24·7 (SD 12·4) and 26·3 (SD 12·4) under SoC and StimFit stimulation, respectively. Mean difference between motor scores was –1·6 (SD 7·1; 95% CI –4·0 to 0·9; superiority test psuperiority=0·20; n=35), establishing non-inferiority of StimFit stimulation at a margin of –5 points (non-inferiority test pnon-inferiority=0·0038). In six patients (17%), initial programming of StimFit settings resulted in acute side-effects and amplitudes were reduced until side-effects disappeared. Interpretation: Automated data-driven algorithms can predict stimulation parameters that lead to motor symptom control comparable to SoC treatment. This approach could significantly decrease the time necessary to obtain optimal treatment parameters.

We aimed to use data from standardised EEG reports to generate seizure prediction models for vulnerable neonates. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included neonates who underwent CEEG during the first 30 days of life at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA, USA). The hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy subgroup included only patients with CEEG data during the first 5 days of life, International Classification of Diseases, revision 10, codes for hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, and documented therapeutic hypothermia. In January, 2018, we implemented a novel CEEG reporting system within the electronic medical record (EMR) using common data elements that incorporated standardised terminology. All neonatal CEEG data from Jan 10, 2018, to Feb 15, 2022, were extracted from the EMR using age at the time of CEEG. We developed logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models of neonatal seizure prediction using EEG features on day 1 to predict seizures on future days. Findings: We evaluated 1117 neonates, including 150 neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, with CEEG data reported using standardised templates between Jan 10, 2018, and Feb 15, 2022. Implementation of a consistent EEG reporting system that documents discrete and standardised EEG variables resulted in more than 95% reporting of key EEG features. Several EEG features were highly correlated, and patients could be clustered on the basis of specific features. However, no simple combination of features adequately predicted seizure risk. We therefore applied computational models to complement clinical identification of neonates at high risk of seizures. Random forest models incorporating background features performed with classification accuracies of up to 90% (95% CI 83–94) for all neonates and 97% (88–99) for neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy; recall (sensitivity) of up to 97% (91–100) for all neonates and 100% (100–100) for neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy; and precision (positive predictive value) of up to 92% (84–96) in the overall cohort and 97% (80–99) in neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. Interpretation: Using data extracted from the standardised EEG report on the first day of CEEG, we predict the presence or absence of neonatal seizures on subsequent days with classification performances of more than 90%. This information, incorporated into routine care, could guide decisions about the necessity of continuing EEG monitoring beyond the first day, thereby improving the allocation of limited CEEG resources. Additionally, this analysis shows the benefits of standardised clinical data collection, which can drive learning health system approaches to personalised CEEG use.

We aimed to develop and validate an algorithm to allow selection of optimal treatment based on glycaemic response, weight change, and tolerability outcomes when choosing between SGLT2 inhibitor or DPP-4 inhibitor therapies. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we identified patients initiating SGLT2 and DPP-4 inhibitor therapies after Jan 1, 2013, from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We excluded those who received SGLT2 or DPP-4 inhibitors as first-line treatment or insulin at the same time, had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 45 mL/min per 1·73 m2, or did not have a valid baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) measure (<53 or ≥120 mmol/mol). The primary efficacy outcome was the HbA1c value reached 6 months after drug initiation, adjusted for baseline HbA1c. Clinical features associated with differential HbA1c outcome on the two therapies were identified in CPRD (n=26 877), and replicated in reanalysis of 14 clinical trials (n=10 414). An algorithm to predict individual-level differential HbA1c outcome on the two therapies was developed in CPRD (derivation; n=14 069) and validated in head-to-head trials (n=2499) and CPRD (independent validation; n=9376). In CPRD, we further explored heterogeneity in 6-month weight change and treatment discontinuation. Findings: Among 10 253 patients initiating SGLT2 inhibitors and 16 624 patients initiating DPP-4 inhibitors in CPRD, baseline HbA1c, age, BMI, eGFR, and alanine aminotransferase were associated with differential HbA1c outcome with SGLT2 inhibitor and DPP-4 inhibitor therapies. The median age of participants was 62·0 years (IQR 55·0–70·0). 10 016 (37·3%) were women and 16 861 (62·7%) were men. An algorithm based on these five features identified a subgroup, representing around four in ten CPRD patients, with a 5 mmol/mol or greater observed benefit with SGLT2 inhibitors in all validation cohorts (CPRD 8·8 mmol/mol [95% CI 7·8–9·8]; CANTATA-D and CANTATA-D2 trials 5·8 mmol/mol [3·9–7·7]; BI1245.20 trial 6·6 mmol/mol [2·2–11·0]). In CPRD, predicted differential HbA1c response with SGLT2 inhibitor and DPP-4 inhibitor therapies was not associated with weight change. Overall treatment discontinuation within 6 months was similar in patients predicted to have an HbA1c benefit with SGLT2 inhibitors over DPP-4 inhibitors (median 15·2% [13·2–20·3] vs 14·4% [12·9–16·7]). A smaller subgroup predicted to have greater HbA1c reduction with DPP-4 inhibitors were twice as likely to discontinue SGLT2 inhibitors than DPP-4 inhibitors (median 26·8% [23·4–31·0] vs 14·8% [12·9–16·8]). Interpretation: A validated treatment selection algorithm for SGLT2 inhibitor and DPP-4 inhibitor therapies can support decisions on optimal treatment for people with type 2 diabetes.

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that external eye photographs contain information about additional systemic medical conditions. Methods: We developed a deep learning system (DLS) that takes external eye photographs as input and predicts systemic parameters, such as those related to the liver (albumin, aspartate aminotransferase [AST]); kidney (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [ACR]); bone or mineral (calcium); thyroid (thyroid stimulating hormone); and blood (haemoglobin, white blood cells [WBC], platelets). This DLS was trained using 123 130 images from 38 398 patients with diabetes undergoing diabetic eye screening in 11 sites across Los Angeles county, CA, USA. Evaluation focused on nine prespecified systemic parameters and leveraged three validation sets (A, B, C) spanning 25 510 patients with and without diabetes undergoing eye screening in three independent sites in Los Angeles county, CA, and the greater Atlanta area, GA, USA. We compared performance against baseline models incorporating available clinicodemographic variables (eg, age, sex, race and ethnicity, years with diabetes). Findings: Relative to the baseline, the DLS achieved statistically significant superior performance at detecting AST >36·0 U/L, calcium <8·6 mg/dL, eGFR <60·0 mL/min/1·73 m2, haemoglobin <11·0 g/dL, platelets <150·0 × 103/μL, ACR ≥300 mg/g, and WBC <4·0 × 103/μL on validation set A (a population resembling the development datasets), with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the DLS exceeding that of the baseline by 5·3–19·9% (absolute differences in AUC). On validation sets B and C, with substantial patient population differences compared with the development datasets, the DLS outperformed the baseline for ACR ≥300·0 mg/g and haemoglobin <11·0 g/dL by 7·3–13·2%. Interpretation: We found further evidence that external eye photographs contain biomarkers spanning multiple organ systems. Such biomarkers could enable accessible and non-invasive screening of disease. Further work is needed to understand the translational implications. Funding: Google. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, improved survival of premature neonates coupled with a scarcity of available experts has raised concerns about the sustainability of this approach. We aimed to develop bespoke and code-free deep learning-based classifiers for plus disease, a hallmark of ROP, in an ethnically diverse population in London, UK, and externally validate them in ethnically, geographically, and socioeconomically diverse populations in four countries and three continents. Code-free deep learning is not reliant on the availability of expertly trained data scientists, thus being of particular potential benefit for low resource health-care settings. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used retinal images from 1370 neonates admitted to a neonatal unit at Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK, between 2008 and 2018. Images were acquired using a Retcam Version 2 device (Natus Medical, Pleasanton, CA, USA) on all babies who were either born at less than 32 weeks gestational age or had a birthweight of less than 1501 g. Each images was graded by two junior ophthalmologists with disagreements adjudicated by a senior paediatric ophthalmologist. Bespoke and code-free deep learning models (CFDL) were developed for the discrimination of healthy, pre-plus disease, and plus disease. Performance was assessed internally on 200 images with the majority vote of three senior paediatric ophthalmologists as the reference standard. External validation was on 338 retinal images from four separate datasets from the USA, Brazil, and Egypt with images derived from Retcam and the 3nethra neo device (Forus Health, Bengaluru, India). Findings: Of the 7414 retinal images in the original dataset, 6141 images were used in the final development dataset. For the discrimination of healthy versus pre-plus or plus disease, the bespoke model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0·986 (95% CI 0·973–0·996) and the CFDL model had an AUC of 0·989 (0·979–0·997) on the internal test set. Both models generalised well to external validation test sets acquired using the Retcam for discriminating healthy from pre-plus or plus disease (bespoke range was 0·975–1·000 and CFDL range was 0·969–0·995). The CFDL model was inferior to the bespoke model on discriminating pre-plus disease from healthy or plus disease in the USA dataset (CFDL 0·808 [95% CI 0·671–0·909, bespoke 0·942 [0·892–0·982]], p=0·0070). Performance also reduced when tested on the 3nethra neo imaging device (CFDL 0·865 [0·742–0·965] and bespoke 0·891 [0·783–0·977]). Interpretation: Both bespoke and CFDL models conferred similar performance to senior paediatric ophthalmologists for discriminating healthy retinal images from ones with features of pre-plus or plus disease; however, CFDL models might generalise less well when considering minority classes. Care should be taken when testing on data acquired using alternative imaging devices from that used for the development dataset. Our study justifies further validation of plus disease classifiers in ROP screening and supports a potential role for code-free approaches to help prevent blindness in vulnerable neonates.

Telemonitoring at home is a promising alternative that fulfils a worldwide need in obstetric health care. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the transformation to digital care. The aim of this study was to evaluate safety, clinical effectiveness, patient satisfaction, and costs of home telemonitoring against hospital care in complicated pregnancies. Methods: We did a multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in six hospitals (four general teaching hospitals and two university hospitals) in the Netherlands (located in Utrecht, Amsterdam, and Groningen). Women aged 18 years and older with singleton pregnancies (>26 weeks gestation) requiring monitoring for pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, fetal anomaly, preterm rupture of membranes, reduced fetal movements, or history of fetal death were included in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to either hospital admission or telemonitoring in (1:1), stratified for the six diagnoses for inclusion and the six centres of inclusion, using block randomisation (block sizes of four and six). When assigned to telemonitoring, participants went home with devices for cardiotocography and blood pressure measurements and had daily contact with their care providers after digitally sending their home measurements. When assigned to hospital admission, participants received care as usual on the ward until the postpartum period. The primary outcome was a composite of adverse perinatal outcomes assessed after delivery, including mortality; an Apgar score below 7 after 5 min or an umbilical arterial pH at birth below 7·05; maternal morbidity; admission of the newborn to the neonatal intensive care unit; and rate of caesarean section. The primary outcome was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The non-inferiority margin for the primary outcome was a 10% absolute increase in composite primary endpoint based on baseline 20% incidence. The study was registered at the Dutch Trial Registration (NL5888) and is now closed to new participants. Findings: From Dec 1, 2016, to Nov 30, 2019, 201 pregnant women were randomly assigned to an intervention procedure. 101 women were allocated to the telemonitoring group and 100 to the hospital admission group. One participant in the telemonitoring group withdrew consent before the intervention was initiated, and 100 participants were analysed for the primary outcome. In the hospital admission group, four participants did not receive the allocated intervention because they did not accept hospital admission. 100 participants in each group were analysed for the primary outcome according to the intention-to-treat principal. No participants were lost to follow-up. The primary outcome occurred in 31 (31%) of 100 participants in the telemonitoring group and in 40 (40%) of 100 participants in the hospital admission group. Adjusted for centre of inclusion, diagnosis, and nulliparity, the risk difference in primary outcome between both groups was 10·3% (95% CI –22·4 to 2·2) lower in the telemonitoring group, below the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 10% absolute increase. A similar distribution for each of the individual components within the composite primary outcome was seen between groups. Five serious adverse events were reported: one neonatal death in the hospital admission group, in addition to one intra-uterine fetal death, two neonatal deaths, and one case of eclampsia in the telemonitoring group, all unrelated to the study. Interpretation: This non-inferiority trial shows the first evidence that telemonitoring might be as safe as hospital admission for monitoring complicated pregnancies.

However, COVID-19 modelling efforts faced many challenges, from poor data quality to changing policy and human behaviour. To extract practical insight from the large body of COVID-19 modelling literature available, we provide a narrative review with a systematic approach that quantitatively assessed prospective, data-driven modelling studies of COVID-19 in the USA. We analysed 136 papers, and focused on the aspects of models that are essential for decision makers. We have documented the forecasting window, methodology, prediction target, datasets used, and geographical resolution for each study. We also found that a large fraction of papers did not evaluate performance (25%), express uncertainty (50%), or state limitations (36%). To remedy some of these identified gaps, we recommend the adoption of the EPIFORGE 2020 model reporting guidelines and creating an information-sharing system that is suitable for fast-paced infectious disease outbreak science. © 2022 The Author(s).

Therefore, we sought to characterise the genomic landscape, comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) utilisation patterns, and treatment patterns across ancestries in a large, diverse, advanced prostate cancer cohort, to determine the impact of genomics on ancestral disparities. Methods: In this large-scale retrospective analysis, the CGP-based genomic landscape was evaluated in biopsy sections from 11 741 patients with prostate cancer, with ancestry inferred using a single nucleotide polymorphism-based approach. Admixture-derived ancestry fractions for each patient were also interrogated. Independently, clinical and treatment information was retrospectively reviewed for 1234 patients in a de-identified US-based clinicogenomic database. Prevalence of gene alterations, including actionable gene alterations, was assessed across ancestries (n=11 741). Furthermore, real-world treatment patterns and overall survival was assessed in the subset of patients with linked clincogenomic information (n=1234). Findings: The CGP cohort included 1422 (12%) men of African ancestry and 9244 (79%) men of European ancestry; the clinicogenomic database cohort included 130 (11%) men of African ancestry and 1017 (82%) men of European ancestry. Men of African ancestry received more lines of therapy before CGP than men of European ancestry (median of two lines [IQR 0–8] vs one line [0–10], p=0·029). In genomic analyses, ancestry-specific mutational landscapes were observed, but the prevalence of alterations in AR, the DNA damage response pathway, and other actionable genes were similar across ancestries. Similar genomic landscapes were observed in analyses that accounted for admixture-derived ancestry fractions. After undergoing CGP, men of African ancestry were less likely to receive a clinical study drug compared with men of European ancestry (12 [10%] of 118 vs 246 [26%] of 938, p=0·0005). Interpretation: Similar rates of gene alterations with therapy implications suggest that differences in actionable genes (including AR and DNA damage response pathway genes) might not be a main driver of disparities across ancestries in advanced prostate cancer. Later CGP utilisation and a lower rate of clinical trial enrolment observed in men of African ancestry could affect genomics, outcomes, and disparities.

These models are now used across multiple subfields, including computational psychiatry and precision psychiatry. Their goals vary from understanding mechanisms underlying disorders to deriving reliable classification and personalised predictions. Rapid growth of new tools and data sources (eg, digital data, gamification, and social media) requires an understanding of the constraints and advantages of different modelling approaches in psychiatry. In this Series paper, we take a critical look at the range of computational models that are used in psychiatry and evaluate their advantages and disadvantages for different purposes and data sources. We describe mechanism-driven and mechanism-agnostic computational models and discuss how interpretability of models is crucial for clinical translation. Based on these evaluations, we provide recommendations on how to build computational models that are clinically useful. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Use of routinely collected data offers several advantages compared with other study designs, including reduced administrative costs, the ability to update analysis as practice patterns evolve, and larger sample sizes. Methodologically, EHR analysis is subject to distinct challenges because data are not collected for research purposes. In this Viewpoint, we elaborate on the importance of in-depth knowledge of clinical workflows and describe six potential pitfalls to be avoided when working with EHR data, drawing on examples from the literature and our experience. We propose solutions for prevention or mitigation of factors associated with each of these six pitfalls—sample selection bias, imprecise variable definitions, limitations to deployment, variable measurement frequency, subjective treatment allocation, and model overfitting. Ultimately, we hope that this Viewpoint will guide researchers to further improve the methodological robustness of EHR analysis. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence algorithm that can distinguish among MIS-C, Kawasaki disease, and other similar febrile illnesses and aid in the diagnosis of patients in the emergency department and acute care setting. Methods: In this retrospective model development and validation study, we developed a deep-learning algorithm called KIDMATCH (Kawasaki Disease vs Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children) using patient age, the five classic clinical Kawasaki disease signs, and 17 laboratory measurements. All features were prospectively collected at the time of initial evaluation from patients diagnosed with Kawasaki disease or other febrile illness between Jan 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2019, at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego (CA, USA). For patients with MIS-C, the same data were collected from patients between May 7, 2020, and July 20, 2021, at Rady Children's Hospital, Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford (CT, USA), and Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CA, USA). We trained a two-stage model consisting of feedforward neural networks to distinguish between patients with MIS-C and those without and then those with Kawasaki disease and other febrile illnesses. After internally validating the algorithm using stratified tenfold cross-validation, we incorporated a conformal prediction framework to tag patients with erroneous data or distribution shifts. We finally externally validated KIDMATCH on patients with MIS-C enrolled between April 22, 2020, and July 21, 2021, from Boston Children's Hospital (MA, USA), Children's National Hospital (Washington, DC, USA), and the CHARMS Study Group consortium of 14 US hospitals. Findings: 1517 patients diagnosed at Rady Children's Hospital between Jan 1, 2009, and June 7, 2021, with MIS-C (n=69), Kawasaki disease (n=775), or other febrile illnesses (n=673) were identified for internal validation, with an additional 16 patients with MIS-C included from Connecticut Children's Medical Center and 50 from Children's Hospital Los Angeles between May 7, 2020, and July 20, 2021. KIDMATCH achieved a median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve during internal validation of 98·8% (IQR 98·0–99·3) in the first stage and 96·0% (95·6–97·2) in the second stage. We externally validated KIDMATCH on 175 patients with MIS-C from Boston Children's Hospital (n=50), Children's National Hospital (n=42), and the CHARMS Study Group consortium of 14 US hospitals (n=83). External validation of KIDMATCH on patients with MIS-C correctly classified 76 of 81 patients (94% accuracy, two rejected by conformal prediction) from 14 hospitals in the CHARMS Study Group consortium, 47 of 49 patients (96% accuracy, one rejected by conformal prediction) from Boston Children's Hospital, and 36 of 40 patients (90% accuracy, two rejected by conformal prediction) from Children's National Hospital. Interpretation: KIDMATCH has the potential to aid front-line clinicians to distinguish between MIS-C, Kawasaki disease, and other similar febrile illnesses to allow prompt treatment and prevent severe complications.

Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of SMS, smartphone application, and website-based interventions on improving glycaemia in adults with type 2 diabetes and report on their reach, uptake, and feasibility. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo on May 25, 2022, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of digital health interventions in reducing glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in adults with type 2 diabetes, published in English from Jan 1, 2009. Screening was carried out using Covidence, and data were extracted following Cochrane's guidelines. The primary endpoint assessed was the change in the mean (and 95% CI) plasma concentration of HbA1c at 3 months or more. Cochrane risk of bias 2 was used to assess risk of bias. Data on reach, uptake, and feasibility were summarised narratively and data on HbA1c reduction were synthesised in a meta-analysis. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria was used to evaluate the level of evidence. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021247845. Findings: Of the 3236 records identified, 56 RCTs from 24 regions (n=11 486 participants), were included in the narrative synthesis, and 26 studies (n=4546 participants) in the meta-analysis. 20 studies used SMS as the primary mode of delivery of the digital health intervention, 25 used smartphone applications, and 11 implemented interventions via websites. Smartphone application interventions reported higher reach compared with SMS and website-based interventions, but website-based interventions reported higher uptake compared with SMS and smartphone application interventions. Effective interventions, in general, included people with greater severity of their condition at baseline (ie, higher HbA1c) and administration of a higher dose intensity of the intervention, such as more frequent use of smartphone applications. Overall, digital health intervention group participants had a –0·30 (95% CI –0·42 to –0·19) percentage point greater reduction in HbA1c, compared with control group participants. The difference in HbA1c reduction between groups was statistically significant when interventions were delivered through smartphone applications (–0·42% [–0·63 to –0·20]) and via SMS (–0·37% [–0·57 to –0·17]), but not when delivered via websites (–0·09% [–0·64 to 0·46]). Due to the considerable heterogeneity between included studies, the level of evidence was moderate overall. Interpretation: Smartphone application and SMS interventions, but not website-based interventions, were associated with better glycaemic control. However, the studies' heterogeneity should be recognised. Considering that both smartphone application and SMS interventions are effective for diabetes management, clinicians should consider factors such as reach, uptake, patient preference, and context of the intervention when deciding on the mode of delivery of the intervention. Nine in ten people worldwide own a feature phone and can receive SMS and four in five people have access to a smartphone, with numerous smartphone applications being available for diabetes management. Clinicians should familiarise themselves with this modality of programme delivery and encourage people with type 2 diabetes to use evidence-based applications for improving their self-management of diabetes. Future research needs to describe in detail the mediators and moderators of the effectiveness and implementation of SMS and smartphone application interventions, such as the optimal dose, frequency, timing, user interface, and communication mode to both further improve their effectiveness and to increase their reach, uptake, and feasibility.

Most patients receive neoadjuvant therapy before complete tumour resection. Histological assessment after resection includes identification of residual tumour tissue and areas of regressive tumour, data which are used to calculate a clinically relevant regression score. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for tumour tissue detection and tumour regression grading in surgical specimens from patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the oesophagogastric junction. Methods: We used one training cohort and four independent test cohorts to develop, train, and validate a deep learning tool. The material consisted of histological slides from surgically resected specimens from patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagogastric junction from three pathology institutes (two in Germany, one in Austria) and oesophageal cancer cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). All slides were from neoadjuvantly treated patients except for those from the TCGA cohort, who were neoadjuvant-therapy naive. Data from training cohort and test cohort cases were extensively manually annotated for 11 tissue classes. A convolutional neural network was trained on the data using a supervised principle. First, the tool was formally validated using manually annotated test datasets. Next, tumour regression grading was assessed in a retrospective cohort of post-neoadjuvant therapy surgical specimens. The grading of the algorithm was compared with that of a group of 12 board-certified pathologists from one department. To further validate the tool, three pathologists processed whole resection cases with and without AI assistance. Findings: Of the four test cohorts, one included 22 manually annotated histological slides (n=20 patients), one included 62 sides (n=15), one included 214 slides (n=69), and the final one included 22 manually annotated histological slides (n=22). In the independent test cohorts the AI tool had high patch-level accuracy for identifying both tumour and regression tissue. When we validated the concordance of the AI tool against analyses by a group of pathologists (n=12), agreement was 63·6% (quadratic kappa 0·749; p<0·0001) at case level. The AI-based regression grading triggered true reclassification of resected tumour slides in seven cases (including six cases who had small tumour regions that were initially missed by pathologists). Use of the AI tool by three pathologists increased interobserver agreement and substantially reduced diagnostic time per case compared with working without AI assistance. Interpretation: Use of our AI tool in the diagnostics of oesophageal adenocarcinoma resection specimens by pathologists increased diagnostic accuracy, interobserver concordance, and significantly reduced assessment time. Prospective validation of the tool is required. Funding: North Rhine-Westphalia state, Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany, and the Wilhelm Sander Foundation. © 2023 The Author(s).

The COVID Oximetry @home (CO@h) programme was implemented across England in November, 2020, providing pulse oximeters to higher-risk people with COVID-19 to enable early detection of deterioration and the need for escalation of care. We aimed to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of individuals enrolled onto the programme and to assess whether there were any inequalities in enrolment. Methods: This retrospective observational study was based on data from a cohort of people resident in England recorded as having a positive COVID-19 test between Oct 1, 2020, and May 3, 2021. The proportion of participants enrolled onto the CO@h programmes in the 7 days before and 28 days after a positive COVID-19 test was calculated for each clinical commissioning group (CCG) in England. Two-level hierarchical multivariable logistic regression with random intercepts for each CCG was run to identify factors predictive of being enrolled onto the CO@h programme. Findings: CO@h programme sites were reported by NHS England as becoming operational between Nov 21 and Dec 31, 2020. 1 227 405 people resident in 72 CCGs had a positive COVID-19 test between the date of programme implementation and May 3, 2021, of whom 19 932 (1·6%) were enrolled onto the CO@h programme. Of those enrolled, 14 441 (72·5%) were aged 50 years or older or were identified as clinically extremely vulnerable (ie, having a high-risk medical condition). Higher odds of enrolment onto the CO@h programme were found in older individuals (adjusted odds ratio 2·21 [95% CI 2·19–2·23], p<0·001, for those aged 50–64 years; 3·48 [3·33–3·63], p<0·001, for those aged 65–79 years; and 2·50 [2·34–2·68], p<0·001, for those aged ≥80 years), in individuals of non-White ethnicity (1·35 [1·28–1·43], p<0·001, for Asian individuals; 1·13 [1·04–1·22], p=0·005, for Black individuals; and 1·17 [1·03–1·32], p=0·015, for those of mixed ethnicity), in those who were overweight (1·31 [1·26–1·37], p<0·001) or obese (1·69 [1·63–1·77], p<0·001), or in those identified as clinically extremely vulnerable (1·58 [1·51–1·65], p<0·001), and lower odds were reported in those from the least socioeconomically deprived areas compared with those from the most socioeconomically deprived areas (0·75 [0·69–0·81]; p<0·001). Interpretation: Nationally, uptake of the CO@h programme was low, with clinical judgment used to determine eligibility. Preferential enrolment onto the pulse oximetry monitoring programme was observed in people known to be at the highest risk of developing severe COVID-19.

This scoping review of reviews characterised the peer-reviewed literature reviews on digital health and telehealth interventions in cancer published from database inception up to May 1, 2022, from PubMed, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, Cochrane Reviews, and Web of Science. Eligible reviews conducted a systematic literature search. Data were extracted in duplicate via a pre-defined online survey. Following screening, 134 reviews met the eligibility criteria. 77 of those reviews were published since 2020. 128 reviews summarised interventions intended for patients, 18 addressed family caregivers, and five addressed health-care providers. 56 reviews did not target a specific phase of the cancer continuum, whereas 48 reviews tended to address the active treatment phase. 29 reviews included a meta-analysis, with results showing positive effects on quality of life, psychological outcomes, and screening behaviours. 83 reviews did not report intervention implementation outcomes but when reported, 36 reported acceptability, 32 feasibility, and 29 fidelity outcomes. Several notable gaps were identified in these literature reviews on digital health and telehealth in cancer care. No reviews specifically addressed older adults, bereavement, or sustainability of interventions and only two reviews focused on comparing telehealth to in-person interventions. Addressing these gaps with rigorous systematic reviews might help guide continued innovation in remote cancer care, particularly for older adults and bereaved families, and integrate and sustain these interventions within oncology. © 2023 The Author(s).

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the eHealth intervention Health4Life in modifying six key lifestyle risk behaviours (ie, alcohol use, tobacco smoking, recreational screen time, physical inactivity, poor diet, and poor sleep, known as the Big 6) among adolescents. Methods: We conducted a cluster-randomised controlled trial in secondary schools that had a minimum of 30 year 7 students, in three Australian states. A biostatistician randomly allocated schools (1:1) to Health4Life (a six-module, web-based programme and accompanying smartphone app) or an active control group (usual health education) with the Blockrand function in R, stratified by site and school gender composition. All students aged 11–13 years who were fluent in English and attended participating schools were eligible. Teachers, students, and researchers were not masked to allocation. Primary outcomes were alcohol use, tobacco use, recreational screen time, moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sugar-sweetened beverage intake, and sleep duration at 24 months, measured by self-report surveys, and analysed in all students who were eligible at baseline. Latent growth models estimated between-group change over time. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12619000431123). Findings: Between April 1, 2019, and Sept 27, 2019, we recruited 85 schools (9280 students), of which 71 schools with 6640 eligible students (36 schools [3610 students] assigned to the intervention and 35 [3030 students] to the control) completed the baseline survey. 14 schools were excluded from the final analysis or withdrew, mostly due to a lack of time. We found no between-group differences for alcohol use (odds ratio 1·24, 95% CI 0·58–2·64), smoking (1·68, 0·76–3·72), screen time (0·79, 0·59–1·06), MVPA (0·82, 0·62–1·09), sugar-sweetened beverage intake (1·02, 0·82–1·26), or sleep (0·91, 0·72–1·14) at 24 months. No adverse events were reported during this trial. Interpretation: Health4Life was not effective in modifying risk behaviours. Our results provide new knowledge about eHealth multiple health behaviour change interventions. However, further research is needed to improve efficacy.

In this systematic evaluation, we aim to establish how PROMs are being used to assess AI health technologies. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov for interventional trials registered from inception to Sept 20, 2022, and included trials that tested an AI health technology. We excluded observational studies, patient registries, and expanded access reports. We extracted data regarding the form, function, and intended use population of the AI health technology, in addition to the PROMs used and whether PROMs were incorporated as an input or output in the AI model. The search identified 2958 trials, of which 627 were included in the analysis. 152 (24%) of the included trials used one or more PROM, visual analogue scale, patient-reported experience measure, or usability measure as a trial endpoint. The type of AI health technologies used by these trials included AI-enabled smart devices, clinical decision support systems, and chatbots. The number of clinical trials of AI health technologies registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and the proportion of trials that used PROMs increased from registry inception to 2022. The most common clinical areas AI health technologies were designed for were digestive system health for non-PROM trials and musculoskeletal health (followed by mental and behavioural health) for PROM trials, with PROMs commonly used in clinical areas for which assessment of health-related quality of life and symptom burden is particularly important. Additionally, AI-enabled smart devices were the most common applications tested in trials that used at least one PROM. 24 trials tested AI models that captured PROM data as an input for the AI model. PROM use in clinical trials of AI health technologies falls behind PROM use in all clinical trials. Trial records having inadequate detail regarding the PROMs used or the type of AI health technology tested was a limitation of this systematic evaluation and might have contributed to inaccuracies in the data synthesised. Overall, the use of PROMs in the function and assessment of AI health technologies is not only possible, but is a powerful way of showing that, even in the most technologically advanced health-care systems, patients' perspectives remain central. © 2023 The Author(s).

We estimated the frequency of common disease combinations and identified non-random disease associations for all ages in a multiethnic population. Methods: In this population-based study, we examined multimorbidity and comorbidity patterns stratified by ethnicity or race, sex, and age for 308 health conditions using electronic health records from individuals included on the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked with the Hospital Episode Statistics admitted patient care dataset in England. We included individuals who were older than 1 year and who had been registered for at least 1 year in a participating general practice during the study period (between April 1, 2010, and March 31, 2015). We identified the most common combinations of conditions and comorbidities for index conditions. We defined comorbidity as the accumulation of additional conditions to an index condition over an individual's lifetime. We used network analysis to identify conditions that co-occurred more often than expected by chance. We developed online interactive tools to explore multimorbidity and comorbidity patterns overall and by subgroup based on ethnicity, sex, and age. Findings: We collected data for 3 872 451 eligible patients, of whom 1 955 700 (50·5%) were women and girls, 1 916 751 (49·5%) were men and boys, 2 666 234 (68·9%) were White, 155 435 (4·0%) were south Asian, and 98 815 (2·6%) were Black. We found that a higher proportion of boys aged 1–9 years (132 506 [47·8%] of 277 158) had two or more diagnosed conditions than did girls in the same age group (106 982 [40·3%] of 265 179), but more women and girls were diagnosed with multimorbidity than were boys aged 10 years and older and men (1 361 232 [80·5%] of 1 690 521 vs 1 161 308 [70·8%] of 1 639 593). White individuals (2 097 536 [78·7%] of 2 666 234) were more likely to be diagnosed with two or more conditions than were Black (59 339 [60·1%] of 98 815) or south Asian individuals (93 617 [60·2%] of 155 435). Depression commonly co-occurred with anxiety, migraine, obesity, atopic conditions, deafness, soft-tissue disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders across all subgroups. Heart failure often co-occurred with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, osteoarthritis, stable angina, myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Spinal fractures were most strongly non-randomly associated with malignancy in Black individuals, but with osteoporosis in White individuals. Hypertension was most strongly associated with kidney disorders in those aged 20–29 years, but with dyslipidaemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes in individuals aged 40 years and older. Breast cancer was associated with different comorbidities in individuals from different ethnic groups. Asthma was associated with different comorbidities between males and females. Bipolar disorder was associated with different comorbidities in younger age groups compared with older age groups. Interpretation: Our findings and interactive online tools are a resource for: patients and their clinicians, to prevent and detect comorbid conditions; research funders and policy makers, to redesign service provision, training priorities, and guideline development; and biomedical researchers and manufacturers of medicines, to provide leads for research into common or sequential pathways of disease and inform the design of clinical trials.

These technologies range from primary data collection in electronic health records (EHRs) and administrative claims to web-based artificial-intelligence-driven analyses. There has been increased use of such health technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven in part by the availability of these data. In some cases, this has resulted in profound and potentially long-lasting positive effects on medical research and routine health-care delivery. In other cases, high profile shortcomings have been evident, potentially attenuating the effect of—or representing a decreased appetite for—digital-health transformation. In this Series paper, we provide an overview of how facets of health technologies in routinely collected medical data (including EHRs and digital data sharing) have been used for COVID-19 research and tracking, and how these technologies might influence future pandemics and health-care research. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of digital-health research during the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss how learnings from COVID-19 might translate into new approaches in a post-pandemic era. © 2022 The Author(s).

Methods: In this systematic review and modelling analysis, we mapped global distributions of all confirmed species of SFG rickettsiae (SFGR) detected in animals, vectors, and human beings, using data collected from the literature. We assessed ecological drivers for the distributions of 17 major SFGR species using machine learning algorithms, and mapped model-predicted risks. Findings: Between Jan 1, 1906, and March 31, 2021, we found reports of 48 confirmed SFGR species, with 66 133 human infections worldwide, with a large spatial variation across the continents. 198 vector species were detected to carry 47 of these Rickettsia spp. (146 ticks, 24 fleas, 15 mosquitoes, six mites, four lice, two keds, and one bug). Based on model-predicted global distributions of the 17 major SFGR species, we found five spatial clusters aggregated by ecological similarity in terms of environmental and ecoclimatic features. Rickettsia felis is the leading SFGR species to which 4·4 billion (95% CI 3·8–5·3 billion) people are at risk, followed by Rickettsia conorii (3·7 billion) and Rickettsia africae (3·6 billion). Interpretation: The wide spectrum of vectors is contributing substantially to the increasing incidence of SFGR infections among humans.

ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group E3311 was a multicentre trial wherein patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma were treated surgically and assigned to a pathological risk-based adjuvant strategy of observation, radiation, or concurrent chemoradiation. Despite protocol exclusion of patients with overt radiographic ENE, more than 30% had pathological ENE and required postoperative chemoradiation. We aimed to evaluate a CT-based deep learning algorithm for prediction of ENE in E3311, a diagnostically challenging cohort wherein algorithm use would be impactful in guiding decision-making. Methods: For this retrospective evaluation of deep learning algorithm performance, we obtained pretreatment CTs and corresponding surgical pathology reports from the multicentre, randomised de-escalation trial E3311. All enrolled patients on E3311 required pretreatment and diagnostic head and neck imaging; patients with radiographically overt ENE were excluded per study protocol. The lymph node with largest short-axis diameter and up to two additional nodes were segmented on each scan and annotated for ENE per pathology reports. Deep learning algorithm performance for ENE prediction was compared with four board-certified head and neck radiologists. The primary endpoint was the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic. Findings: From 178 collected scans, 313 nodes were annotated: 71 (23%) with ENE in general, 39 (13%) with ENE larger than 1 mm ENE. The deep learning algorithm AUC for ENE classification was 0·86 (95% CI 0·82–0·90), outperforming all readers (p<0·0001 for each). Among radiologists, there was high variability in specificity (43–86%) and sensitivity (45–96%) with poor inter-reader agreement (κ 0·32). Matching the algorithm specificity to that of the reader with highest AUC (R2, false positive rate 22%) yielded improved sensitivity to 75% (+ 13%). Setting the algorithm false positive rate to 30% yielded 90% sensitivity. The algorithm showed improved performance compared with radiologists for ENE larger than 1 mm (p<0·0001) and in nodes with short-axis diameter 1 cm or larger. Interpretation: The deep learning algorithm outperformed experts in predicting pathological ENE on a challenging cohort of patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma from a randomised clinical trial. Deep learning algorithms should be evaluated prospectively as a treatment selection tool.

However, there are few studies of adverse events associated with vaccination in children. The aim of this study was to systematically assess the adverse events of two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination in the paediatric population. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patient electronic health records (EHRs) of children aged 5–17 years who received the primary two-dose series of the BNT162b2 vaccine between Jan 5, 2021, and Aug 5, 2022, at the Mayo Clinic Health System (MN, FL, AZ, IA, and WI), USA. Using natural language processing, we automatically curated adverse events reported by physicians in EHR clinical notes before and after vaccination. To determine significant adverse events after BNT162b2 vaccination, we calculated risk differences, which was defined as the percentage difference between the rate of children with an adverse event after a vaccine dose and the baseline rate of children with an adverse event before vaccination. 95% CIs and p values were calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen score method. Findings: 56 436 individuals aged 5–17 years (20 227 aged 5–11 years and 36 209 aged 12–17 years) with EHRs in the Mayo Clinic Health Systems were included in the study. Overall, the reporting of adverse events remained low in passive surveillance. Serious adverse events were rare after the first and second doses of BNT162b2, with rates of anaphylaxis (six [0·01%] of 56 436), myocarditis (five [0·01%]), and pericarditis (three [0·01%]) consistent with previous studies. Among the 20 227 5–11-year-olds, there were increased risks of fatigue (58 after second dose vs 41 before first dose; risk difference [RD]dose2 0·08% [95% CI –0·01 to 0·18], p=0·044) and fever (104 after second dose vs 77 before first dose; RDdose2 0·13% [0·00 to 0·27], p=0·022) after the second dose. Among the 36 209 12–17-year-olds, there were increased risks of arthralgia (69 after second dose vs 48 before first dose; RDdose2 0·06% [–0·00 to 0·12], p=0·026), chills (58 after second dose vs 40 before first dose; RDdose2 0·05% [–0·00 to 0·11], p=0·034), and myalgia (96 after second dose vs 73 before first dose; RDdose2 0·06% [–0·01 to 0·14], p=0·038) after the second dose. Although the overall incidence was low, there was an increased risk of myocarditis in males aged 12–17 years after the second dose (five after second dose vs zero before first dose; RDdose2 0·03% [0·01 to 0·07], p=0·013), with median age being 15 years (IQR 14 to 16). Interpretation: Overall, this data suggests that vaccination with BNT162b2 in the paediatric population is generally safe and well-tolerated. Further research is warranted to investigate the basis for the increased risk of myocarditis in adolescent males. Additionally, further studies are needed to confirm whether the findings in our study population apply to the whole vaccinated paediatric population. Funding: nference. © 2023 The Author(s).

We aimed to develop and validate quantitative CT-based models for predicting severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Methods: We analysed the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS) cohort, a multicentre study done at 12 clinical sites across the USA, of individuals aged 40–80 years from four strata: individuals who never smoked, individuals who smoked but had normal spirometry, individuals who smoked and had mild to moderate COPD, and individuals who smoked and had severe COPD. We used 3-year follow-up data to develop logistic regression classifiers for predicting severe exacerbations. Predictors included age, sex, race, BMI, pulmonary function, exacerbation history, smoking status, respiratory quality of life, and CT-based measures of density gradient texture and airway structure. We externally validated our models in a subset from the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) cohort. Discriminative model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which was also compared with other predictors, including exacerbation history and the BMI, airflow obstruction, dyspnoea, and exercise capacity (BODE) index. We evaluated model calibration using calibration plots and Brier scores. Findings: Participants in SPIROMICS were enrolled between Nov 12, 2010, and July 31, 2015. Participants in COPDGene were enrolled between Jan 10, 2008, and April 15, 2011. We included 1956 participants from the SPIROMICS cohort who had complete 3-year follow-up data: the mean age of the cohort was 63·1 years (SD 9·2) and 1017 (52%) were men and 939 (48%) were women. Among the 1956 participants, 434 (22%) had a history of at least one severe exacerbation. For the CT-based models, the AUC was 0·854 (95% CI 0·852–0·855) for at least one severe exacerbation within 3 years and 0·931 (0·930–0·933) for consistent exacerbations (defined as ≥1 acute episode in each of the 3 years). Models were well calibrated with low Brier scores (0·121 for at least one severe exacerbation; 0·039 for consistent exacerbations). For the prediction of at least one severe event during 3-year follow-up, AUCs were significantly higher with CT biomarkers (0·854 [0·852–0·855]) than exacerbation history (0·823 [0·822–0·825]) and BODE index 0·812 [0·811–0·814]). 6965 participants were included in the external validation cohort, with a mean age of 60·5 years (SD 8·9). In this cohort, AUC for at least one severe exacerbation was 0·768 (0·767–0·769; Brier score 0·088). Interpretation: CT-based prediction models can be used for identification of patients with COPD who are at high risk of severe exacerbations.

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of SMS, smartphone application, and website interventions on improving blood pressure in adults with hypertension, and to report on their reach, uptake, and feasibility. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, and APA PsycInfo on May 25, 2022, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English from Jan 1, 2009, that examined the effectiveness of digital health interventions on reducing blood pressure in adults with hypertension. Screening was carried out using Covidence, and data were extracted following Cochrane's guidelines. The primary endpoint was change in the mean of systolic blood pressure. Risk of bias was assessed with Cochrane Risk of Bias 2. Data on systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction were synthesised in a meta-analysis, and data on reach, uptake and feasibility were summarised narratively. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria were used to evaluate the level of evidence. The study was registered with PROSPERO CRD42021247845. Findings: Of the 3235 records identified, 29 RCTs from 13 regions (n=7592 participants) were included in the systematic review, and 28 of these RCTs (n=7092 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. 11 studies used SMS as the primary mode of delivery of the digital health intervention, 13 used smartphone applications, and five used websites. Overall, digital health intervention group participants had a –3·62 mm Hg (95% CI –5·22 to –2·02) greater reduction in systolic blood pressure, and a –2·45 mm Hg (–3·83 to –1·07) greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure, compared with control group participants. No statistically significant differences between the three different modes of delivery were observed for both the systolic (p=0·73) and the diastolic blood pressure (p=0·80) outcomes. Smartphone application interventions had a statistically significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure (–2·45 mm Hg [–4·15 to –0·74]); however, there were no statistically significant reductions for SMS interventions (–1·80 mm Hg [–4·60 to 1·00]) or website interventions (–3·43 mm Hg [–7·24 to 0·38]). Due to the considerable heterogeneity between included studies and the high risk of bias in some, the level of evidence was assigned a low overall score. Interventions were more effective among people with greater severity of hypertension at baseline. SMS interventions reported higher reach and smartphone application studies reported higher uptake, but differences were not statistically significant. Interpretation: SMS, smartphone application, and website interventions were associated with statistically and clinically significant systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions, compared with usual care, regardless of the mode of delivery of the intervention. This conclusion is tempered by the considerable heterogeneity of included studies and the high risk of bias in most. Future studies need to describe in detail the mediators and moderators of the effectiveness and implementation of these interventions, to both further improve their effectiveness as well as increase their reach, uptake, and feasibility.

Infrastructure and resource requirements can further complicate case verification. Using machine-learning techniques, we have developed and tested a region-specific questionnaire panel and predictive model to identify people who have had a convulsive seizure. These findings have been implemented into a free app for health-care workers in Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Tanzania, and South Africa. Methods: In this retrospective case-control study, we used data from the Studies of the Epidemiology of Epilepsy in Demographic Sites in Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Tanzania, and South Africa. We randomly split these individuals using a 7:3 ratio into a training dataset and a validation dataset. We used information gain and correlation-based feature selection to identify eight binary features to predict convulsive seizures. We then assessed several machine-learning algorithms to create a multivariate prediction model. We validated the best-performing model with the internal dataset and a prospectively collected external-validation dataset. We additionally evaluated a leave-one-site-out model (LOSO), in which the model was trained on data from all sites except one that, in turn, formed the validation dataset. We used these features to develop a questionnaire-based predictive panel that we implemented into a multilingual app (the Epilepsy Diagnostic Companion) for health-care workers in each geographical region. Findings: We analysed epilepsy-specific data from 4097 people, of whom 1985 (48·5%) had convulsive epilepsy, and 2112 were controls. From 170 clinical variables, we initially identified 20 candidate predictor features. Eight features were removed, six because of negligible information gain and two following review by a panel of qualified neurologists. Correlation-based feature selection identified eight variables that demonstrated predictive value; all were associated with an increased risk of an epileptic convulsion except one. The logistic regression, support vector, and naive Bayes models performed similarly, outperforming the decision-tree model. We chose the logistic regression model for its interpretability and implementability. The area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) was 0·92 (95% CI 0·91–0·94, sensitivity 85·0%, specificity 93·7%) in the internal-validation dataset and 0·95 (0·92–0·98, sensitivity 97·5%, specificity 82·4%) in the external-validation dataset. Similar results were observed for the LOSO model (AUC 0·94, 0·93–0·96, sensitivity 88·2%, specificity 95·3%). Interpretation: On the basis of these findings, we developed the Epilepsy Diagnostic Companion as a predictive model and app offering a validated culture-specific and region-specific solution to confirm the diagnosis of a convulsive epileptic seizure in people with suspected epilepsy. The questionnaire panel is simple and accessible for health-care workers without specialist knowledge to administer. This tool can be iteratively updated and could lead to earlier, more accurate diagnosis of seizures and improve care for people with epilepsy.

A key step in the evaluation process is the external validation of diagnostic performance using a test set of images. We conducted a rapid literature review on methods to develop test sets, published from 2012 to 2020, in English. Using thematic analysis, we mapped themes and coded the principles using the Population, Intervention, and Comparator or Reference standard, Outcome, and Study design framework. A group of screening and AI experts assessed the evidence-based principles for completeness and provided further considerations. From the final 15 principles recommended here, five affect population, one intervention, two comparator, one reference standard, and one both reference standard and comparator. Finally, four are appliable to outcome and one to study design. Principles from the literature were useful to address biases from AI; however, they did not account for screening specific biases, which we now incorporate. The principles set out here should be used to support the development and use of test sets for studies that assess the accuracy of AI within screening programmes, to ensure they are fit for purpose and minimise bias. © 2022 The Author(s).

EEG's larger-scale implementation is, however, hindered by the shortage of expertise needed for the interpretation of spontaneous cortical activity, the EEG background. We developed an automated algorithm that transforms EEG recordings to quantified interpretations of EEG background and provides simple intuitive visualisations in patient monitors. Methods: In this method-development and proof-of-concept study, we collected visually classified EEGs from infants recovering from birth asphyxia or stroke. We used unsupervised learning methods to explore latent EEG characteristics, which guided the supervised training of a deep learning-based classifier. We assessed the classifier performance using cross-validation and an external validation dataset. We constructed a novel measure of cortical function, brain state of the newborn (BSN), from the novel EEG background classifier and a previously published sleep-state classifier. We estimated clinical utility of the BSN by identification of two key items in newborn brain monitoring, the onset of continuous cortical activity and sleep-wake cycling, compared with the visual interpretation of the raw EEG signal and the amplitude-integrated (aEEG) trend. Findings: We collected 2561 h of EEG from 39 infants (gestational age 35·0–42·1 weeks; postnatal age 0–7 days). The external validation dataset included 105 h of EEG from 31 full-term infants. The overall accuracy of the EEG background classifier was 92% in the whole cohort (95% CI 91–96; range 85–100 for individual infants). BSN trend values were closely related to the onset of continuous EEG activity or sleep-wake cycling, and BSN levels showed robust difference between aEEG categories. The temporal evolution of the BSN trends showed early diverging trajectories in infants with severely abnormal outcomes. Interpretation: The BSN trend can be implemented in bedside patient monitors as an EEG interpretation that is intuitive, transparent, and clinically explainable. A quantitative trend measure of brain function might harmonise practices across medical centres, enable wider use of brain monitoring in neurocritical care, and might facilitate clinical intervention trials.

We searched Web of Science, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, PubMed, Scopus, and the ACM Digital Library on Dec 6, 2021 (PROSPERO registration number CRD42022312922). We also performed manual searches in journals of interest until April 12, 2022. Although our search strategy had no language restrictions, all retrieved studies were in English. We included studies showing reidentification, identification, or authentication with data from wearable devices. Our search retrieved 17 625 studies, and 72 studies met our inclusion criteria. We designed a custom assessment tool for study quality and risk of bias assessments. 64 studies were classified as high quality and eight as moderate quality, and we did not detect any bias in any of the included studies. Correct identification rates were typically 86–100%, indicating a high risk of reidentification. Additionally, as little as 1–300 s of recording were required to enable reidentification from sensors that are generally not thought to generate identifiable information, such as electrocardiograms. These findings call for concerted efforts to rethink methods for data sharing to promote advances in research innovation while preventing the loss of individual privacy. © 2023 The Author(s).

The real-world implementation of these tools is increasingly considered the prime solution for key issues in mental health, such as delayed, inaccurate, and inefficient care delivery. Similarly, machine-learning-based empirical strategies are becoming commonplace in psychiatric research because of their potential to adequately deconstruct the biopsychosocial complexity of mental health disorders, and hence to improve nosology of prognostic and preventive paradigms. However, the implementation steps needed to translate these promises into practice are currently hampered by multiple interacting challenges. These obstructions range from the current technology-distant state of clinical practice, over the lack of valid real-world databases required to feed data-intensive AI algorithms, to model development and validation considerations being disconnected from the core principles of clinical utility and ethical acceptability. In this Series paper, we provide recommendations on how these challenges could be addressed from an interdisciplinary perspective to pave the way towards a framework for mental health care, leveraging the combined strengths of human intelligence and AI. © 2022 The Author(s).

Exploring these spatial characteristics will enable us to better identify cross-level molecular markers that could deepen our understanding of cancer biology and related patient outcomes. Methods: We proposed a graph neural network approach that emphasises spatialisation of tumour tiles towards a comprehensive evaluation of predicting cross-level molecular profiles of genetic mutations, copy number alterations, and functional protein expressions from whole-slide images. We introduced a transformation strategy that converts whole-slide image scans into graph-structured data to address the spatial heterogeneity of colon cancer. We developed and assessed the performance of the model on The Cancer Genome Atlas colon adenocarcinoma (TCGA-COAD) and validated it on two external datasets (ie, The Cancer Genome Atlas rectum adenocarcinoma [TCGA-READ] and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium colon adenocarcinoma [CPTAC-COAD]). We also predicted microsatellite instability and result interpretability. Findings: The model was developed on 459 colon tumour whole-slide images from TCGA-COAD, and externally validated on 165 rectum tumour whole-slide images from TCGA-READ and 161 colon tumour whole-slide images from CPTAC-COAD. For TCGA cohorts, our method accurately predicted the molecular classes of the gene mutations (area under the curve [AUCs] from 82·54 [95% CI 77·41–87·14] to 87·08 [83·28–90·82] on TCGA-COAD, and AUCs from 70·46 [61·37–79·61] to 81·80 [72·20–89·70] on TCGA-READ), along with genes with copy number alterations (AUCs from 81·98 [73·34–89·68] to 90·55 [86·02–94·89] on TCGA-COAD, and AUCs from 62·05 [48·94–73·46] to 76·48 [64·78–86·71] on TCGA-READ), microsatellite instability (MSI) status classification (AUC 83·92 [77·41–87·59] on TCGA-COAD, and AUC 61·28 [53·28–67·93] on TCGA-READ), and protein expressions (AUCs from 85·57 [81·16–89·44] to 89·64 [86·29–93·19] on TCGA-COAD, and AUCs from 51·77 [42·53–61·83] to 59·79 [50·79–68·57] on TCGA-READ). For the CPTAC-COAD cohort, our model predicted a panel of gene mutations with AUC values from 63·74 (95% CI 52·92–75·37) to 82·90 (73·69–90·71), genes with copy number alterations with AUC values from 62·39 (51·37–73·76) to 86·08 (79·67–91·74), and MSI status prediction with AUC value of 73·15 (63·21–83·13). Interpretation: We showed that spatially connected graph models enable molecular profile predictions in colon cancer and are generalised to rectum cancer. After further validation, our method could be used to infer the prognostic value of multiscale molecular biomarkers and identify targeted therapies for patients with colon cancer.

In this Health Policy paper, we review the current landscape of commercial health data vendors, with special emphasis on the sources of their data, challenges associated with data reproducibility and generalisability, and ethical considerations for data vending. We argue for sustainable approaches to curating open-source health data to enable global populations to be included in the biomedical research community.

Methods: This multivariable, population-based, modelling study recruited adult (aged ≥18 years) participants living in the USA who had a smartwatch or fitness tracker on any device that connected to Apple HealthKit or Google Fit and had joined the DETECT study by downloading the MyDataHelps app. In the model development cohort, we included people who had participated in DETECT between April 1, 2020, and Jan 14, 2022. In the validation cohort, we included individuals who had participated between Jan 15 and Feb 15, 2022. When a participant joins DETECT, they fill out an intake survey of demographic information, including their ZIP code (postal code), and surveys on symptoms, symptom onset, and viral illness test dates and results, if they become unwell. When a participant connects their device, historical sensor data are collected, if available. Sensor data continue to be collected unless a participant withdraws from the study. Using sensor data, we collected each participant's daily resting heart rate and step count during the entire study period and identified anomalous sensor days, in which resting heart rate was higher than, and step count was lower than, a specified threshold calculated for each individual by use of their baseline data. The proportion of users with anomalous data each day was used to create a 7-day moving average. For the main cohort, a negative binomial model predicting 7-day moving averages for COVID-19 case counts, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in real time, 6 days in the future, and 12 days in the future in the USA and California was fitted with CDC-reported data from 3 days before alone (H0) or in combination with anomalous sensor data (H1). We compared the predictions with Pearson correlation. We then validated the model in the validation cohort. Findings: Between April 1, 2020, and Jan 14, 2022, 35 842 participants enrolled in DETECT, of whom 4006 in California and 28 527 in the USA were included in our main cohort. The H1 model significantly outperformed the H0 model in predicting the 7-day moving average COVID-19 case counts in California and the USA. For example, Pearson correlation coefficients for predictions 12 days in the future increased by 32·9% in California (from 0·70 [95% CI 0·65–0·73] to 0·93 [0·92–0·94]) and by 12·2% (from 0·82 [0·79–0·84] to 0·92 [0·91–0·93]) in the USA from the H0 model to the H1 model. Our validation model also showed significant correlations for predictions in real time, 6 days in the future, and 12 days in the future. Interpretation: Our study showed that passively collected sensor data from consenting participants can provide real-time disease tracking and forecasting. With a growing population of wearable technology users, these sensor data could be integrated into viral surveillance programmes.

The CRIT-CoV-U pilot study generated a urinary proteomic biomarker consisting of 50 peptides (COV50), which predicted death and disease progression from SARS-CoV-2. After the interim analysis presented for the German Government, here, we aimed to analyse the full dataset to consolidate the findings and propose potential clinical applications of this biomarker. Methods: CRIT-CoV-U was a prospective multicentre cohort study. In eight European countries (Austria, France, Germany, Greece, North Macedonia, Poland, Spain, and Sweden), 1012 adults with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were followed up for death and progression along the 8-point WHO scale. Capillary electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry was used for urinary proteomic profiling. Statistical methods included logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis with a comparison of the area under curve (AUC) between nested models. Hospitalisation costs were derived from the care facility corresponding with the Markov chain probability of reaching WHO scores ranging from 3 to 8 and flat-rate hospitalisation costs adjusted for the gross per capita domestic product of each country. Findings: From June 30 to Nov 19, 2020, 228 participants were recruited, and from April 30, 2020, to April 14, 2021, 784 participants were recruited, resulting in a total of 1012 participants. The entry WHO scores were 1–3 in 445 (44%) participants, 4–5 in 529 (52%) participants, and 6 in 38 (4%) participants; and of all participants, 119 died and 271 had disease progression. The odds ratio (OR) associated with COV50 in all 1012 participants for death was 2·44 (95% CI 2·05–2·92) unadjusted and 1·67 (1·34–2·07) when adjusted for sex, age, BMI, comorbidities, and baseline WHO score; and for disease progression, the OR was 1·79 (1·60–2·01) when unadjusted and 1·63 (1·41–1·91) when adjusted (p<0·0001 for all). The predictive accuracy of the optimised COV50 thresholds was 74·4% (71·6–77·1%) for mortality (threshold 0·47) and 67·4% (64·4–70·3%) for disease progression (threshold 0·04). When adjusted for covariables and the baseline WHO score, these thresholds improved AUCs from 0·835 to 0·853 (p=0·033) for death and from 0·697 to 0·730 (p=0·0008) for progression. Of 196 participants who received ambulatory care, 194 (99%) did not reach the 0·04 threshold. The cost reductions associated with 1 day less hospitalisation per 1000 participants were million Euro (M€) 0·887 (5–95% percentile interval 0·730–1·039) in participants at a low risk (COV50 <0·04) and M€2·098 (1·839-2·365) in participants at a high risk (COV50 ≥0·04). Interpretation: The urinary proteomic COV50 marker might be predictive of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Even in people with mild-to-moderate PCR-confirmed infections (WHO scores 1–4), the 0·04 COV50 threshold justifies earlier drug treatment, thereby potentially reducing the number of days in hospital and associated costs.

In addition, methods from the broad field of artificial intelligence, such as radiomics, have the potential to considerably affect clinical trials and clinical practice in the future. Radiomics is a method to extract undiscovered features from routinely acquired imaging data that can neither be captured by means of human perception nor conventional image analysis. In patients with brain cancer, radiomics has shown its potential for the non-invasive identification of prognostic biomarkers, automated response assessment, and differentiation between treatment-related changes from tumour progression. Despite promising results, radiomics is not yet established in routine clinical practice nor in clinical trials. In this Viewpoint, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Brain Tumour Group summarises the current status of radiomics, discusses its potential and limitations, envisions its future role in clinical trials in neuro-oncology, and provides guidance on how to address the challenges in radiomics. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, they do not adequately capture asthma control in patients with fluctuating symptoms. Using the Mobile Airways Sentinel Network for airway diseases (MASK-air) app, we developed and validated an electronic daily asthma control score (e-DASTHMA). Methods: We used MASK-air data (freely available to users in 27 countries) to develop and assess different daily control scores for asthma. Data-driven control scores were developed based on asthma symptoms reported by a visual analogue scale (VAS) and self-reported asthma medication use. We included the daily monitoring data from all MASK-air users aged 16–90 years (or older than 13 years to 90 years in countries with a lower age of digital consent) who had used the app in at least 3 different calendar months and had reported at least 1 day of asthma medication use. For each score, we assessed construct validity, test–retest reliability, responsiveness, and accuracy. We used VASs on dyspnoea and work disturbance, EQ-5D-VAS, Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Test (CARAT), CARAT asthma, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: Allergy Specific (WPAI:AS) questionnaires as comparators. We performed an internal validation using MASK-air data from Jan 1 to Oct 12, 2022, and an external validation using a cohort of patients with physician-diagnosed asthma (the INSPIRERS cohort) who had had their diagnosis and control (Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] classification) of asthma ascertained by a physician. Findings: We studied 135 635 days of MASK-air data from 1662 users from May 21, 2015, to Dec 31, 2021. The scores were strongly correlated with VAS dyspnoea (Spearman correlation coefficient range 0·68–0·82) and moderately correlated with work comparators and quality-of-life-related comparators (for WPAI:AS work, we observed Spearman correlation coefficients of 0·59–0·68). They also displayed high test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients range 0·79–0·95) and moderate-to-high responsiveness (correlation coefficient range 0·69–0·79; effect size measures range 0·57–0·99 in the comparison with VAS dyspnoea). The best-performing score displayed a strong correlation with the effect of asthma on work and school activities in the INSPIRERS cohort (Spearman correlation coefficients 0·70; 95% CI 0·61–0·78) and good accuracy for the identification of patients with uncontrolled or partly controlled asthma according to GINA (area under the receiver operating curve 0·73; 95% CI 0·68–0·78). Interpretation: e-DASTHMA is a good tool for the daily assessment of asthma control. This tool can be used as an endpoint in clinical trials as well as in clinical practice to assess fluctuations in asthma control and guide treatment optimisation. Funding: None. © 2023 The Author(s).

Using our published framework, we aimed to discover heart failure subtypes and validate them upon population representative data. Methods: In this external, prognostic, and genetic validation study we analysed individuals aged 30 years or older with incident heart failure from two population-based databases in the UK (Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD] and The Health Improvement Network [THIN]) from 1998 to 2018. Pre-heart failure and post-heart failure factors (n=645) included demographic information, history, examination, blood laboratory values, and medications. We identified subtypes using four unsupervised machine learning methods (K-means, hierarchical, K-Medoids, and mixture model clustering) with 87 of 645 factors in each dataset. We evaluated subtypes for (1) external validity (across datasets); (2) prognostic validity (predictive accuracy for 1-year mortality); and (3) genetic validity (UK Biobank), association with polygenic risk score (PRS) for heart failure-related traits (n=11), and single nucleotide polymorphisms (n=12). Findings: We included 188 800, 124 262, and 9573 individuals with incident heart failure from CPRD, THIN, and UK Biobank, respectively, between Jan 1, 1998, and Jan 1, 2018. After identifying five clusters, we labelled heart failure subtypes as (1) early onset, (2) late onset, (3) atrial fibrillation related, (4) metabolic, and (5) cardiometabolic. In the external validity analysis, subtypes were similar across datasets (c-statistics: THIN model in CPRD ranged from 0·79 [subtype 3] to 0·94 [subtype 1], and CPRD model in THIN ranged from 0·79 [subtype 1] to 0·92 [subtypes 2 and 5]). In the prognostic validity analysis, 1-year all-cause mortality after heart failure diagnosis (subtype 1 0·20 [95% CI 0·14–0·25], subtype 2 0·46 [0·43–0·49], subtype 3 0·61 [0·57–0·64], subtype 4 0·11 [0·07–0·16], and subtype 5 0·37 [0·32–0·41]) differed across subtypes in CPRD and THIN data, as did risk of non-fatal cardiovascular diseases and all-cause hospitalisation. In the genetic validity analysis the atrial fibrillation-related subtype showed associations with the related PRS. Late onset and cardiometabolic subtypes were the most similar and strongly associated with PRS for hypertension, myocardial infarction, and obesity (p<0·0009). We developed a prototype app for routine clinical use, which could enable evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Interpretation: Across four methods and three datasets, including genetic data, in the largest study of incident heart failure to date, we identified five machine learning-informed subtypes, which might inform aetiological research, clinical risk prediction, and the design of heart failure trials.

Decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) is the main indicator of progression; however, missingness prevents long-term analysis of patterns in lung function. We aimed to identify distinct clusters of lung function trajectory among patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis using machine learning techniques. Methods: We did a secondary analysis of longitudinal data on FVC collected from a cohort of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis from the PROFILE study; a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study. We evaluated the imputation performance of conventional and machine learning techniques to impute missing data and then analysed the fully imputed dataset by unsupervised clustering using self-organising maps. We compared anthropometric features, genomic associations, serum biomarkers, and clinical outcomes between clusters. We also performed a replication of the analysis on data from a cohort of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis from an independent dataset, obtained from the Chicago Consortium. Findings: 415 (71%) of 581 participants recruited into the PROFILE study were eligible for further analysis. An unsupervised machine learning algorithm had the lowest imputation error among tested methods, and self-organising maps identified four distinct clusters (1–4), which was confirmed by sensitivity analysis. Cluster 1 comprised 140 (34%) participants and was associated with a disease trajectory showing a linear decline in FVC over 3 years. Cluster 2 comprised 100 (24%) participants and was associated with a trajectory showing an initial improvement in FVC before subsequently decreasing. Cluster 3 comprised 113 (27%) participants and was associated with a trajectory showing an initial decline in FVC before subsequent stabilisation. Cluster 4 comprised 62 (15%) participants and was associated with a trajectory showing stable lung function. Median survival was shortest in cluster 1 (2·87 years [IQR 2·29–3·40]) and cluster 3 (2·23 years [1·75–3·84]), followed by cluster 2 (4·74 years [3·96–5·73]), and was longest in cluster 4 (5·56 years [5·18–6·62]). Baseline FEV1 to FVC ratio and concentrations of the biomarker SP-D were significantly higher in clusters 1 and 3. Similar lung function clusters with some shared anthropometric features were identified in the replication cohort. Interpretation: Using a data-driven unsupervised approach, we identified four clusters of lung function trajectory with distinct clinical and biochemical features. Enriching or stratifying longitudinal spirometric data into clusters might optimise evaluation of intervention efficacy during clinical trials and patient management.

Morphological quality assessment and morphokinetic analysis both have the disadvantage of intra-observer and inter-observer variability. A third method, preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A), has limitations too, including its invasiveness and cost. We hypothesised that differences in aneuploid and euploid embryos that allow for model-based classification are reflected in morphology, morphokinetics, and associated clinical information. Methods: In this retrospective study, we used machine-learning and deep-learning approaches to develop STORK-A, a non-invasive and automated method of embryo evaluation that uses artificial intelligence to predict embryo ploidy status. Our method used a dataset of 10 378 embryos that consisted of static images captured at 110 h after intracytoplasmic sperm injection, morphokinetic parameters, blastocyst morphological assessments, maternal age, and ploidy status. Independent and external datasets, Weill Cornell Medicine EmbryoScope+ (WCM-ES+; Weill Cornell Medicine Center of Reproductive Medicine, NY, USA) and IVI Valencia (IVI Valencia, Health Research Institute la Fe, Valencia, Spain) were used to test the generalisability of STORK-A and were compared measuring accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Findings: Analysis and model development included the use of 10 378 embryos, all with PGT-A results, from 1385 patients (maternal age range 21–48 years; mean age 36·98 years [SD 4·62]). STORK-A predicted aneuploid versus euploid embryos with an accuracy of 69·3% (95% CI 66·9–71·5; AUC 0·761; positive predictive value [PPV] 76·1%; negative predictive value [NPV] 62·1%) when using images, maternal age, morphokinetics, and blastocyst score. A second classification task trained to predict complex aneuploidy versus euploidy and single aneuploidy produced an accuracy of 74·0% (95% CI 71·7–76·1; AUC 0·760; PPV 54·9%; NPV 87·6%) using an image, maternal age, morphokinetic parameters, and blastocyst grade. A third classification task trained to predict complex aneuploidy versus euploidy had an accuracy of 77·6% (95% CI 75·0–80·0; AUC 0·847; PPV 76·7%; NPV 78·0%). STORK-A reported accuracies of 63·4% (AUC 0·702) on the WCM-ES+ dataset and 65·7% (AUC 0·715) on the IVI Valencia dataset, when using an image, maternal age, and morphokinetic parameters, similar to the STORK-A test dataset accuracy of 67·8% (AUC 0·737), showing generalisability. Interpretation: As a proof of concept, STORK-A shows an ability to predict embryo ploidy in a non-invasive manner and shows future potential as a standardised supplementation to traditional methods of embryo selection and prioritisation for implantation or recommendation for PGT-A.

It allows AI technologies to incorporate patients' own views of their symptoms and predict outcomes, reflecting a more holistic picture of health and wellbeing and ultimately helping patients and clinicians to make the best health-care decisions together. By positioning patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as a model input or output we propose a framework to embed PROMs within the function and evaluation of AI health care. However, the integration of PROs in AI systems presents several challenges. These challenges include (1) fragmentation of PRO data collection; (2) validation of AI systems trained and validated against clinician performance, rather than outcome data; (3) scarcity of large-scale PRO datasets; (4) inadequate selection of PROMs for the target population and inadequate infrastructure for collecting PROs; and (5) clinicians might not recognise the value of PROs and therefore not prioritise their adoption; and (6) studies involving PRO or AI frequently present suboptimal design. Notwithstanding these challenges, we propose considerations for the inclusion of PROs in AI health-care technologies to avoid promoting survival at the expense of wellbeing. © 2023 The Author(s).

Technological advances have led to the regular use of structured electronic health-care records with the potential to address key deficits in clinical evidence that could improve patient care. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown this potential in big data and related analytics but has also revealed important limitations. Data verification, data validation, data privacy, and a mandate from the public to conduct research are important challenges to effective use of routine health-care data. The European Society of Cardiology and the BigData@Heart consortium have brought together a range of international stakeholders, including representation from patients, clinicians, scientists, regulators, journal editors, and industry members. In this Review, we propose the CODE-EHR minimum standards framework to be used by researchers and clinicians to improve the design of studies and enhance transparency of study methods.

We aimed to develop an interpretable deep learning pipeline for whole-slide-image-based prediction of the four molecular classes in endometrial cancer (im4MEC), to identify morpho-molecular correlates, and to refine prognostication. Methods: This combined analysis included diagnostic haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides and molecular and clinicopathological data from 2028 patients with intermediate-to-high-risk endometrial cancer from the PORTEC-1 (n=466), PORTEC-2 (n=375), and PORTEC-3 (n=393) randomised trials and the TransPORTEC pilot study (n=110), the Medisch Spectrum Twente cohort (n=242), a case series of patients with POLEmut endometrial cancer in the Leiden Endometrial Cancer Repository (n=47), and The Cancer Genome Atlas-Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma cohort (n=395). PORTEC-3 was held out as an independent test set and a four-fold cross validation was performed. Performance was measured with the macro and class-wise area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Whole-slide images were segmented into tiles of 360 μm resized to 224 × 224 pixels. im4MEC was trained to learn tile-level morphological features with self-supervised learning and to molecularly classify whole-slide images with an attention mechanism. The top 20 tiles with the highest attention scores were reviewed to identify morpho-molecular correlates. Predictions of a nuclear classification deep learning model serve to derive interpretable morphological features. We analysed 5-year recurrence-free survival and explored prognostic refinement by molecular class using the Kaplan-Meier method. Findings: im4MEC attained macro-average AUROCs of 0·874 (95% CI 0·856–0·893) on four-fold cross-validation and 0·876 on the independent test set. The class-wise AUROCs were 0·849 for POLEmut (n=51), 0·844 for MMRd (n=134), 0·883 for NSMP (n=120), and 0·928 for p53abn (n=88). POLEmut and MMRd tiles had a high density of lymphocytes, p53abn tiles had strong nuclear atypia, and the morphology of POLEmut and MMRd endometrial cancer overlapped. im4MEC highlighted a low tumour-to-stroma ratio as a potentially novel characteristic feature of the NSMP class. 5-year recurrence-free survival was significantly different between im4MEC predicted molecular classes in PORTEC-3 (log-rank p<0·0001). The ten patients with aggressive p53abn endometrial cancer that was predicted as MMRd showed inflammatory morphology and appeared to have a better prognosis than patients with correctly predicted p53abn endometrial cancer (p=0·30). The four patients with NSMP endometrial cancer that was predicted as p53abn showed higher nuclear atypia and appeared to have a worse prognosis than patients with correctly predicted NSMP (p=0·13). Patients with MMRd endometrial cancer predicted as POLEmut had an excellent prognosis, as do those with true POLEmut endometrial cancer. Interpretation: We present the first interpretable deep learning model, im4MEC, for haematoxylin and eosin-based prediction of molecular endometrial cancer classification. im4MEC robustly identified morpho-molecular correlates and could enable further prognostic refinement of patients with endometrial cancer.

We aimed to identify and classify reports of menstrual irregularities and vaginal bleeding after COVID-19 vaccination submitted to a voluntary active surveillance system. Methods: This observational cohort study included recipients of a COVID-19 vaccine who were aged 18 years and older and reported their health experiences to v-safe, a voluntary smartphone-based active surveillance system for monitoring COVID-19 vaccine safety in the USA, from Dec 14, 2020, to Jan 9, 2022. Responses to survey questions on reactions after vaccination were extracted, and a pre-trained natural language inference model was used to identify and classify free-text comments related to menstruation and vaginal bleeding in response to an open-ended prompt about any symptoms at intervals after vaccination. Related responses were further categorised into themes of timing, severity, perimenopausal and postmenopausal bleeding, resumption of menses, and other responses. We examined associations between symptom theme and respondent characteristics, including vaccine type and dose number received, solicited local and systemic reactions reported, and health care sought. Findings: 63 815 respondents reported on menstrual irregularities or vaginal bleeding, which included 62 679 female respondents (1·0% of 5 975 363 female respondents aged ≥18 years). Common themes identified included timing of menstruation (70 981 [83·6%] responses) and severity of menstrual symptoms (56 890 [67·0%] responses). Other themes included menopausal bleeding (3439 [4·0%] responses) and resumption of menses (2378 [2·8%] responses). Respondents submitting reports related to menopausal bleeding were more likely to seek health care than were those submitting reports related to other menstruation and vaginal bleeding themes. Interpretation: Reports of heterogeneous symptoms related to menstruation or vaginal bleeding after COVID-19 vaccination are being submitted to v-safe, although this study is unable to characterise the relationship of these symptoms to COVID-19 vaccination. Methods that leverage pretrained models to interpret and classify unsolicited signs and symptoms in free-text reports offer promise in the initial evaluation of unexpected adverse events potentially associated with use of newly authorised or licensed vaccines.

The aim of the study was to investigate the incremental effect of the implementation of AI detection tools in screening colonoscopy on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, and the cost-effectiveness of such tools. Methods: We conducted Markov model microsimulation of using colonoscopy with and without AI for colorectal cancer screening for individuals at average risk (no personal or family history of colorectal cancer, adenomas, inflammatory bowel disease, or hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome). We ran the microsimulation in a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 individuals in the USA aged 50–100 years. The primary analysis investigated screening colonoscopy with versus without AI every 10 years starting at age 50 years and finishing at age 80 years, with follow-up until age 100 years, assuming 60% screening population uptake. In secondary analyses, we modelled once-in-life screening colonoscopy at age 65 years in adults aged 50–79 years at average risk for colorectal cancer. Post-polypectomy surveillance followed the simplified current guideline. Costs of AI tools and cost for downstream treatment of screening detected disease were estimated with 3% annual discount rates. The main outcome measures included the incremental effect of AI-assisted colonoscopy versus standard (no-AI) colonoscopy on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, and cost-effectiveness of screening projected for the average risk screening US population. Findings: In the primary analyses, compared with no screening, the relative reduction of colorectal cancer incidence with screening colonoscopy without AI tools was 44·2% and with screening colonoscopy with AI tools was 48·9% (4·8% incremental gain). Compared with no screening, the relative reduction in colorectal cancer mortality with screening colonoscopy with no AI was 48·7% and with screening colonoscopy with AI was 52·3% (3·6% incremental gain). AI detection tools decreased the discounted costs per screened individual from $3400 to $3343 (a saving of $57 per individual). Results were similar in the secondary analyses modelling once-in-life colonoscopy. At the US population level, the implementation of AI detection during screening colonoscopy resulted in yearly additional prevention of 7194 colorectal cancer cases and 2089 related deaths, and a yearly saving of US$290 million. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that implementation of AI detection tools in screening colonoscopy is a cost-saving strategy to further prevent colorectal cancer incidence and mortality.

This is despite previous presentations to primary care with symptoms. We aimed to test an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm applied to a single-lead ECG, recorded during ECG-enabled stethoscope examination, to validate a potential point-of-care screening tool for LVEF of 40% or lower. Methods: We conducted an observational, prospective, multicentre study of a convolutional neural network (known as AI-ECG) that was previously validated for the detection of reduced LVEF using 12-lead ECG as input. We used AI-ECG retrained to interpret single-lead ECG input alone. Patients (aged ≥18 years) attending for transthoracic echocardiogram in London (UK) were recruited. All participants had 15 s of supine, single-lead ECG recorded at the four standard anatomical positions for cardiac auscultation, plus one handheld position, using an ECG-enabled stethoscope. Transthoracic echocardiogram-derived percentage LVEF was used as ground truth. The primary outcome was performance of AI-ECG at classifying reduced LVEF (LVEF ≤40%), measured using metrics including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity, with two-sided 95% CIs. The primary outcome was reported for each position individually and with an optimal combination of AI-ECG outputs (interval range 0–1) from two positions using a rule-based approach and several classification models. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04601415. Findings: Between Feb 6 and May 27, 2021, we recruited 1050 patients (mean age 62 years [SD 17·4], 535 [51%] male, 432 [41%] non-White). 945 (90%) had an ejection fraction of at least 40%, and 105 (10%) had an ejection fraction of 40% or lower. Across all positions, ECGs were most frequently of adequate quality for AI-ECG interpretation at the pulmonary position (979 [93·3%] of 1050). Quality was lowest for the aortic position (846 [80·6%]). AI-ECG performed best at the pulmonary valve position (p=0·02), with an AUROC of 0·85 (95% CI 0·81–0·89), sensitivity of 84·8% (76·2–91·3), and specificity of 69·5% (66·4–72·6). Diagnostic odds ratios did not differ by age, sex, or non-White ethnicity. Taking the optimal combination of two positions (pulmonary and handheld positions), the rule-based approach resulted in an AUROC of 0·85 (0·81–0·89), sensitivity of 82·7% (72·7–90·2), and specificity of 79·9% (77·0–82·6). Using AI-ECG outputs from these two positions, a weighted logistic regression with l2 regularisation resulted in an AUROC of 0·91 (0·88–0·95), sensitivity of 91·9% (78·1–98·3), and specificity of 80·2% (75·5–84·3). Interpretation: A deep learning system applied to single-lead ECGs acquired during a routine examination with an ECG-enabled stethoscope can detect LVEF of 40% or lower. These findings highlight the potential for inexpensive, non-invasive, workflow-adapted, point-of-care screening, for earlier diagnosis and prognostically beneficial treatment.

In this study, we aimed to identify and validate prognostic models against a new consensus definition of postoperative pulmonary complications. Methods: We did a systematic review and international external validation cohort study. The systematic review was done in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched MEDLINE and Embase on March 1, 2020, for articles published in English that reported on risk prediction models for postoperative pulmonary complications following abdominal surgery. External validation of existing models was done within a prospective international cohort study of adult patients (≥18 years) undergoing major abdominal surgery. Data were collected between Jan 1, 2019, and April 30, 2019, in the UK, Ireland, and Australia. Discriminative ability and prognostic accuracy summary statistics were compared between models for the 30-day postoperative pulmonary complication rate as defined by the Standardised Endpoints in Perioperative Medicine Core Outcome Measures in Perioperative and Anaesthetic Care (StEP-COMPAC). Model performance was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC). Findings: In total, we identified 2903 records from our literature search; of which, 2514 (86·6%) unique records were screened, 121 (4·8%) of 2514 full texts were assessed for eligibility, and 29 unique prognostic models were identified. Nine (31·0%) of 29 models had score development reported only, 19 (65·5%) had undergone internal validation, and only four (13·8%) had been externally validated. Data to validate six eligible models were collected in the international external validation cohort study. Data from 11 591 patients were available, with an overall postoperative pulmonary complication rate of 7·8% (n=903). None of the six models showed good discrimination (defined as AUROCC ≥0·70) for identifying postoperative pulmonary complications, with the Assess Respiratory Risk in Surgical Patients in Catalonia score showing the best discrimination (AUROCC 0·700 [95% CI 0·683–0·717]). Interpretation: In the pre-COVID-19 pandemic data, variability in the risk of pulmonary complications (StEP-COMPAC definition) following major abdominal surgery was poorly described by existing prognostication tools. To improve surgical safety during the COVID-19 pandemic recovery and beyond, novel risk stratification tools are required. Funding: British Journal of Surgery Society. © 2022 The Author(s).

We aimed to develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict 3-month risk of opioid overdose using Pennsylvania Medicaid data and externally validated it in two data sources (ie, later years of Pennsylvania Medicaid data and data from a different state). Methods: This prognostic modelling study developed and validated a machine-learning algorithm to predict overdose in Medicaid beneficiaries with one or more opioid prescription in Pennsylvania and Arizona, USA. To predict risk of hospital or emergency department visits for overdose in the subsequent 3 months, we measured 284 potential predictors from pharmaceutical and health-care encounter claims data in 3-month periods, starting 3 months before the first opioid prescription and continuing until loss to follow-up or study end. We developed and internally validated a gradient-boosting machine algorithm to predict overdose using 2013–16 Pennsylvania Medicaid data (n=639 693). We externally validated the model using (1) 2017–18 Pennsylvania Medicaid data (n=318 585) and (2) 2015–17 Arizona Medicaid data (n=391 959). We reported several prediction performance metrics (eg, C-statistic, positive predictive value). Beneficiaries were stratified into risk-score subgroups to support clinical use. Findings: A total of 8641 (1·35%) 2013–16 Pennsylvania Medicaid beneficiaries, 2705 (0·85%) 2017–18 Pennsylvania Medicaid beneficiaries, and 2410 (0·61%) 2015–17 Arizona beneficiaries had one or more overdose during the study period. C-statistics for the algorithm predicting 3-month overdoses developed from the 2013–16 Pennsylvania training dataset and validated on the 2013–16 Pennsylvania internal validation dataset, 2017–18 Pennsylvania external validation dataset, and 2015–17 Arizona external validation dataset were 0·841 (95% CI 0·835–0·847), 0·828 (0·822–0·834), and 0·817 (0·807–0·826), respectively. In external validation datasets, 71 361 (22·4%) of 318 585 2017–18 Pennsylvania beneficiaries were in high-risk subgroups (positive predictive value of 0·38–4·08%; capturing 73% of overdoses in the subsequent 3 months) and 40 041 (10%) of 391 959 2015–17 Arizona beneficiaries were in high-risk subgroups (positive predictive value of 0·19–1·97%; capturing 55% of overdoses). Lower risk subgroups in both validation datasets had few individuals (≤0·2%) with an overdose. Interpretation: A machine-learning algorithm predicting opioid overdose derived from Pennsylvania Medicaid data performed well in external validation with more recent Pennsylvania data and with Arizona Medicaid data. The algorithm might be valuable for overdose risk prediction and stratification in Medicaid beneficiaries.

We conducted a scoping review to identify key use cases in which artificial intelligence (AI) could be leveraged to reduce the frequency of ADEs. We focused on modern machine learning techniques and natural language processing. 78 articles were included in the scoping review. Studies were heterogeneous and applied various AI techniques covering a wide range of medications and ADEs. We identified several key use cases in which AI could contribute to reducing the frequency and consequences of ADEs, through prediction to prevent ADEs and early detection to mitigate the effects. Most studies (73 [94%] of 78) assessed technical algorithm performance, and few studies evaluated the use of AI in clinical settings. Most articles (58 [74%] of 78) were published within the past 5 years, highlighting an emerging area of study. Availability of new types of data, such as genetic information, and access to unstructured clinical notes might further advance the field. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to develop and externally validate a prognostic model involving contemporary deep phenotyping that can be used to generate individual risk estimates of hospitalisation for heart failure or all-cause mortality in patients with, or at risk of, heart failure, but who have not previously been hospitalised for heart failure. Methods: Between June 1, 2016, and May 31, 2018, 3019 consecutive adult patients (aged ≥16 years) undergoing cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) at Manchester University National Health Service Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK, were prospectively recruited into a model development cohort. Candidate predictor variables were selected according to clinical practice and literature review. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to develop a prognostic model. The final model was validated in an external cohort of 1242 consecutive adult patients undergoing CMR at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, between June 1, 2010, and March 25, 2016. Exclusion criteria for both cohorts included previous hospitalisation for heart failure. Our study outcome was a composite of first hospitalisation for heart failure or all-cause mortality after CMR. Model performance was evaluated in both cohorts by discrimination (Harrell's C-index) and calibration (assessed graphically). Findings: Median follow-up durations were 1118 days (IQR 950–1324) for the development cohort and 2117 days (1685–2446) for the validation cohort. The composite outcome occurred in 225 (7·5%) of 3019 patients in the development cohort and in 219 (17·6%) of 1242 patients in the validation cohort. The final, externally validated, parsimonious, multivariable model comprised the predictors: age, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and the CMR variables, global longitudinal strain, myocardial infarction, and myocardial extracellular volume. The median optimism-adjusted C-index for the externally validated model across 20 imputed model development datasets was 0·805 (95% CI 0·793–0·829) in the development cohort and 0·793 (0·766–0·820) in the external validation cohort. Model calibration was excellent across the full risk profile. A risk calculator that provides an estimated risk of hospitalisation for heart failure or all-cause mortality at 3 years after CMR for individual patients was generated. Interpretation: We developed and externally validated a risk prediction model that provides accurate, individualised estimates of the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure and all-cause mortality in patients with, or at risk of, heart failure, before first hospitalisation.

We compared differences between Black and White individuals in PCE-estimated absolute cardiovascular disease risk across various plausible risk factor combinations with the aim of evaluating if using the PCE might result in different clinical decisions in Black versus White individuals with identical risk profiles. Methods: We generated in silico patient risk profiles by combining numerical risk factors (age [5-year intervals], total cholesterol [20-mg/dl intervals], HDL cholesterol [5-mg/dl intervals], systolic blood pressure [10-mm Hg intervals]) and binary risk factors (smoking, diabetes, and antihypertensive treatment). We compared PCE-estimated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk in Black versus White individuals with identical risk profiles. We did similar comparisons using eligible participants in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) third generation cohort and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017–18. Findings: For our in silico analysis, we evaluated 29 515 risk factor combinations for women and 30 565 for men, after excluding profiles that generated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk estimates below 1% or above 30%. There were 6357 risk profiles associated with 10-year cardiovascular disease risk above 7·5% for Black men but not for White men (median risk difference [RD] 6·25%, range 0·15–22·8; median relative risk [RR] 2·40, range 1·02–12·6). There were 391 profiles with 10-year cardiovascular disease risk above 7·5% for White men but not Black men (median RD 2·68%, range 0·07–16·9%; median RR 1·42, range 1·01–3·57). There were 6543 risk profiles associated with 10-year estimated cardiovascular disease risk above 7·5% for Black women but not for White women (median RD 6·14%, range 0·35–26·8%; median RR 2·29, range 1·05–12·6). There were 318 profiles with 10-year cardiovascular disease risk above 7·5% for White women but not Black women (median RD 3·71%, range 0·22–20·1%; median RR 1·66, range 1·03–5·46). For the population-based samples, we calculated the PCE-based 10-year cardiovascular disease risk for 1272 eligible participants (378 women; median age 48 years [IQR 44–52]; 100% White) in the FHS third generation cohort and 550 participants (223 women [36·8% Black] and 327 men [40·4% Black]; median age 61 years [IQR 52–67]) in the NHANES cohort. The population-based samples showed similar risk differences to that of the in silico analyses. Interpretation: The PCE might generate substantially divergent cardiovascular disease risk estimates for Black versus White individuals with identical risk profiles, which could introduce race-related variations in clinical recommendations for cardiovascular disease prevention.

Contacts enable spread of many infections, yet most risk prediction frameworks fail to account for their dynamics. We developed, tested, and internationally validated a real-time machine-learning framework, incorporating dynamic patient-contact networks to predict hospital-onset COVID-19 infections (HOCIs) at the individual level. Methods: We report an international retrospective cohort study of our framework, which extracted patient-contact networks from routine hospital data and combined network-derived variables with clinical and contextual information to predict individual infection risk. We trained and tested the framework on HOCIs using the data from 51 157 hospital inpatients admitted to a UK National Health Service hospital group (Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust) between April 1, 2020, and April 1, 2021, intersecting the first two COVID-19 surges. We validated the framework using data from a Swiss hospital group (Department of Rehabilitation, Geneva University Hospitals) during a COVID-19 surge (from March 1 to May 31, 2020; 40 057 inpatients) and from the same UK group after COVID-19 surges (from April 2 to Aug 13, 2021; 43 375 inpatients). All inpatients with a bed allocation during the study periods were included in the computation of network-derived and contextual variables. In predicting patient-level HOCI risk, only inpatients spending 3 or more days in hospital during the study period were examined for HOCI acquisition risk. Findings: The framework was highly predictive across test data with all variable types (area under the curve [AUC]-receiver operating characteristic curve [ROC] 0·89 [95% CI 0·88–0·90]) and similarly predictive using only contact-network variables (0·88 [0·86–0·90]). Prediction was reduced when using only hospital contextual (AUC-ROC 0·82 [95% CI 0·80–0·84]) or patient clinical (0·64 [0·62–0·66]) variables. A model with only three variables (ie, network closeness, direct contacts with infectious patients [network derived], and hospital COVID-19 prevalence [hospital contextual]) achieved AUC-ROC 0·85 (95% CI 0·82–0·88). Incorporating contact-network variables improved performance across both validation datasets (AUC-ROC in the Geneva dataset increased from 0·84 [95% CI 0·82–0·86] to 0·88 [0·86–0·90]; AUC-ROC in the UK post-surge dataset increased from 0·49 [0·46–0·52] to 0·68 [0·64–0·70]). Interpretation: Dynamic contact networks are robust predictors of individual patient risk of HOCIs. Their integration in clinical care could enhance individualised infection prevention and early diagnosis of COVID-19 and other nosocomial infections.

Aggregated location data from mobile phones are an important source of real-time information about human mobility on a population level, but the degree to which these mobility metrics capture the relevant contact patterns of individuals at risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 is not clear. In this study we describe changes in the relationship between mobile phone data and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the USA. Methods: In this population-based study, we collected epidemiological data on COVID-19 cases and deaths, as well as human mobility metrics collated by advertisement technology that was derived from global positioning systems, from 1396 counties across the USA that had at least 100 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. We grouped these counties into six ordinal categories, defined by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and graded from urban to rural, and quantified the changes in COVID-19 transmission using estimates of the effective reproduction number (Rt) between Jan 22 and July 9, 2020, to investigate the relationship between aggregated mobility metrics and epidemic trajectory. For each county, we model the time series of Rt values with mobility proxies. Findings: We show that the reproduction number is most strongly associated with mobility proxies for change in the travel into counties (0·757 [95% CI 0·689 to 0·857]), but this relationship primarily holds for counties in the three most urban categories as defined by the NCHS. This relationship weakens considerably after the initial 15 weeks of the epidemic (0·442 [−0·492 to −0·392]), consistent with the emergence of more complex local policies and behaviours, including masking. Interpretation: Our study shows that the integration of mobility metrics into retrospective modelling efforts can be useful in identifying links between these metrics and Rt. Importantly, we highlight potential issues in the data generation process for transmission indicators derived from mobile phone data, representativeness, and equity of access, which must be addressed to improve the interpretability of these data in public health.

Although multiple machine learning models have been proposed to address this issue, because of their requirements for extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering, they have not been validated or implemented outside of their original study site. Therefore, we aimed to develop accurate and transferrable predictive models of outcomes on hospital admission for patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this study, we developed recurrent neural network-based models (CovRNN) to predict the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 by use of available electronic health record data on admission to hospital, without the need for specific feature selection or missing data imputation. CovRNN was designed to predict three outcomes: in-hospital mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and prolonged hospital stay (>7 days). For in-hospital mortality and mechanical ventilation, CovRNN produced time-to-event risk scores (survival prediction; evaluated by the concordance index) and all-time risk scores (binary prediction; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] was the main metric); we only trained a binary classification model for prolonged hospital stay. For binary classification tasks, we compared CovRNN against traditional machine learning algorithms: logistic regression and light gradient boost machine. Our models were trained and validated on the heterogeneous, deidentified data of 247 960 patients with COVID-19 from 87 US health-care systems derived from the Cerner Real-World COVID-19 Q3 Dataset up to September 2020. We held out the data of 4175 patients from two hospitals for external validation. The remaining 243 785 patients from the 85 health systems were grouped into training (n=170 626), validation (n=24 378), and multi-hospital test (n=48 781) sets. Model performance was evaluated in the multi-hospital test set. The transferability of CovRNN was externally validated by use of deidentified data from 36 140 patients derived from the US-based Optum deidentified COVID-19 electronic health record dataset (version 1015; from January, 2007, to Oct 15, 2020). Exact dates of data extraction were masked by the databases to ensure patient data safety. Findings: CovRNN binary models achieved AUROCs of 93·0% (95% CI 92·6–93·4) for the prediction of in-hospital mortality, 92·9% (92·6–93·2) for the prediction of mechanical ventilation, and 86·5% (86·2–86·9) for the prediction of a prolonged hospital stay, outperforming light gradient boost machine and logistic regression algorithms. External validation confirmed AUROCs in similar ranges (91·3–97·0% for in-hospital mortality prediction, 91·5–96·0% for the prediction of mechanical ventilation, and 81·0–88·3% for the prediction of prolonged hospital stay). For survival prediction, CovRNN achieved a concordance index of 86·0% (95% CI 85·1–86·9) for in-hospital mortality and 92·6% (92·2–93·0) for mechanical ventilation. Interpretation: Trained on a large, heterogeneous, real-world dataset, our CovRNN models showed high prediction accuracy and transferability through consistently good performances on multiple external datasets. Our results show the feasibility of a COVID-19 predictive model that delivers high accuracy without the need for complex feature engineering.

Few hospital-wide solutions exist to comprehensively and reliably identify these conditions to prioritise care and guide treatment. The aim of this study was to apply natural language processing (NLP) to clinical notes collected in the electronic health record (EHR) to accurately screen for substance misuse. Methods: The model was trained and developed on a reference dataset derived from a hospital-wide programme at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC), Chicago, IL, USA, that used structured diagnostic interviews to manually screen admitted patients over 27 months (between Oct 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2019; n=54 915). The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test and Drug Abuse Screening Tool served as reference standards. The first 24 h of notes in the EHR were mapped to standardised medical vocabulary and fed into single-label, multilabel, and multilabel with auxillary-task neural network models. Temporal validation of the model was done using data from the subsequent 12 months on a subset of RUMC patients (n=16 917). External validation was done using data from Loyola University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA between Jan 1, 2007, and Sept 30, 2017 (n=1991 adult patients). The primary outcome was discrimination for alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, or non-opioid drug misuse. Discrimination was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Calibration slope and intercept were measured with the unreliability index. Bias assessments were performed across demographic subgroups. Findings: The model was trained on a cohort that had 3·5% misuse (n=1 921) with any type of substance. 220 (11%) of 1921 patients with substance misuse had more than one type of misuse. The multilabel convolutional neural network classifier had a mean AUROC of 0·97 (95% CI 0·96–0·98) during temporal validation for all types of substance misuse. The model was well calibrated and showed good face validity with model features containing explicit mentions of aberrant drug-taking behaviour. A false-negative rate of 0·18–0·19 and a false-positive rate of 0·03 between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White groups occurred. In external validation, the AUROCs for alcohol and opioid misuse were 0·88 (95% CI 0·86–0·90) and 0·94 (0·92–0·95), respectively. Interpretation: We developed a novel and accurate approach to leveraging the first 24 h of EHR notes for screening multiple types of substance misuse.

The UK National Screening Committee's assessments of the use of AI systems to examine screening mammograms continues to focus on maximising benefits and minimising harms to women screened, when deciding whether to recommend the implementation of AI into the Breast Screening Programme in the UK. Maintaining or improving programme specificity is important to minimise anxiety from false positive results. When considering cancer detection, AI test sensitivity alone is not sufficiently informative, and additional information on the spectrum of disease detected and interval cancers is crucial to better understand the benefits and harms of screening. Although large retrospective studies might provide useful evidence by directly comparing test accuracy and spectrum of disease detected between different AI systems and by population subgroup, most retrospective studies are biased due to differential verification (ie, the use of different reference standards to verify the target condition among study participants). Enriched, multiple-reader, multiple-case, test set laboratory studies are also biased due to the laboratory effect (ie, radiologists’ performance in retrospective, laboratory, observer studies is substantially different to their performance in a clinical environment). Therefore, assessment of the effect of incorporating any AI system into the breast screening pathway in prospective studies is required as it will provide key evidence for the effect of the interaction of medical staff with AI, and the impact on women's outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial Intelligence; Breast Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Retrospective Studies; United Kingdom; Diseases; Mammography; X ray screens; Artificial intelligence systems; Breast Cancer; Breast cancer screening; Breast screening; False positive; Human readers; Performance; Screening mammogram; Screening programs; Spectra's; anxiety; artificial intelligence; breast cancer; cancer screening; clinical assessment; clinical outcome; diagnostic accuracy; evidence based practice; health program; human; laboratory test; mammography; Review; standard; United Kingdom; artificial intelligence; breast tumor; early cancer diagnosis; female; procedures; retrospective study; Artificial intelligence","Elsevier Ltd","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133101902"

To overcome this limitation, we recently introduced a machine learning algorithm that predicts the likelihood of myocardial infarction. Our aim was to evaluate whether this algorithm performs well in routine clinical practice and predicts subsequent events. Methods: The myocardial-ischaemic-injury-index (MI3) algorithm was validated in a prespecified exploratory analysis using data from a multi-centre randomised trial done in Scotland, UK that included consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome undergoing serial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I measurement. Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were excluded. MI3 incorporates age, sex, and two troponin measurements to compute a value (0–100) reflecting an individual's likelihood of myocardial infarction during the index visit and estimates diagnostic performance metrics (including area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve, and the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value) at the computed score. Model performance for an index diagnosis of myocardial infarction (type 1 or type 4b), and for subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death at 1 year was determined using the previously defined low-probability threshold (1·6) and high-probability MI3 threshold (49·7). The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01852123. Findings: In total, 20 761 patients (64 years [SD 16], 9597 [46%] women) enrolled between June 10, 2013, and March 3, 2016, were included from the High-STEACS trial cohort, of whom 3272 (15·8%) had myocardial infarction. MI3 had an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve of 0·949 (95% CI 0·946–0·952) identifying 12 983 (62·5%) patients as low-probability for myocardial infarction at the pre-specified threshold (MI3 score <1·6; sensitivity 99·3% [95% CI 99·0–99·6], negative predictive value 99·8% [99·8–99·9]), and 2961 (14·3%) as high-probability at the pre-specified threshold (MI3 score ≥49·7; specificity 95·0% [94·6–95·3], positive predictive value 70·4% [68·7–72·0]). At 1 year, subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death occurred more often in high-probability patients than low-probability patients (520 [17·6%] of 2961 vs 197 [1·5%] of 12 983], p<0·0001). Interpretation: In consecutive patients undergoing serial cardiac troponin measurement for suspected acute coronary syndrome, the MI3 algorithm accurately estimated the likelihood of myocardial infarction and predicted subsequent adverse cardiovascular events. By providing individual probabilities the MI3 algorithm could improve the diagnosis and assessment of risk in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.

We aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence radiopathomics integrated model to predict pathological complete response in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer using pretreatment MRI and haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained biopsy slides. Methods: In this multicentre observational study, eligible participants who had undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by radical surgery were recruited, with their pretreatment pelvic MRI (T2-weighted imaging, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging) and whole slide images of H&E-stained biopsy sections collected for annotation and feature extraction. The RAdioPathomics Integrated preDiction System (RAPIDS) was constructed by machine learning on the basis of three feature sets associated with pathological complete response: radiomics MRI features, pathomics nucleus features, and pathomics microenvironment features from a retrospective training cohort. The accuracy of RAPIDS for the prediction of pathological complete response in locally advanced rectal cancer was verified in two retrospective external validation cohorts and further validated in a multicentre, prospective observational study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04271657). Model performances were evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Findings: Between Sept 25, 2009, and Nov 3, 2017, 303 patients were retrospectively recruited in the training cohort, 480 in validation cohort 1, and 150 in validation cohort 2; 100 eligible patients were enrolled in the prospective study between Jan 10 and June 10, 2020. RAPIDS had favourable accuracy for the prediction of pathological complete response in the training cohort (AUC 0·868 [95% CI 0·825–0·912]), and in validation cohort 1 (0·860 [0·828–0·892]) and validation cohort 2 (0·872 [0·810–0·934]). In the prospective validation study, RAPIDS had an AUC of 0·812 (95% CI 0·717–0·907), sensitivity of 0·888 (0·728–0·999), specificity of 0·740 (0·593–0·886), NPV of 0·929 (0·862–0·995), and PPV of 0·512 (0·313–0·710). RAPIDS also significantly outperformed single-modality prediction models (AUC 0·630 [0·507–0·754] for the pathomics microenvironment model, 0·716 [0·580–0·852] for the radiomics MRI model, and 0·733 [0·620–0·845] for the pathomics nucleus model; all p<0·0001). Interpretation: RAPIDS was able to predict pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy based on pretreatment radiopathomics images with high accuracy and robustness and could therefore provide a novel tool to assist in individualised management of locally advanced rectal cancer.

Accurate individualised prediction of peritoneal recurrence is crucial to identify patients who might benefit from intensive treatment. We aimed to develop predictive models for peritoneal recurrence and prognosis in gastric cancer. Methods: In this retrospective multi-institution study of 2320 patients, we developed a multitask deep learning model for the simultaneous prediction of peritoneal recurrence and disease-free survival using preoperative CT images. Patients in the training cohort (n=510) and the internal validation cohort (n=767) were recruited from Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China. Patients in the external validation cohort (n=1043) were recruited from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China. We evaluated the prognostic accuracy of the model as well as its association with chemotherapy response. Furthermore, we assessed whether the model could improve the ability of clinicians to predict peritoneal recurrence. Findings: The deep learning model had a consistently high accuracy in predicting peritoneal recurrence in the training cohort (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0·857; 95% CI 0·826–0·889), internal validation cohort (0·856; 0·829–0·882), and external validation cohort (0·843; 0·819–0·866). When informed by the artificial intelligence (AI) model, the sensitivity and inter-rater agreement of oncologists for predicting peritoneal recurrence was improved. The model was able to predict disease-free survival in the training cohort (C-index 0·654; 95% CI 0·616–0·691), internal validation cohort (0·668; 0·643–0·693), and external validation cohort (0·610; 0·583–0·636). In multivariable analysis, the model predicted peritoneal recurrence and disease-free survival independently of clinicopathological variables (p<0·0001 for all). For patients with a predicted high risk of peritoneal recurrence and low survival, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved disease-free survival in both stage II disease (hazard ratio [HR] 0·543 [95% CI 0·362–0·815]; p=0·003) and stage III disease (0·531 [0·432–0·652]; p<0·0001). By contrast, chemotherapy had no impact on disease-free survival for patients with a predicted low risk of peritoneal recurrence and high survival. For the remaining patients, the benefit of chemotherapy depended on stage: only those with stage III disease derived benefit from chemotherapy (HR 0·637 [95% CI 0·484–0·838]; p=0·001). Interpretation: The deep learning model could allow accurate prediction of peritoneal recurrence and survival in patients with gastric cancer. Prospective studies are required to test the clinical utility of this model in guiding personalised treatment in combination with clinicopathological criteria. Funding: None. © 2022 The Author(s).

Although some cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 are believed to be associated with severity, there are no early biomarkers that can reliably predict patients who are more likely to have adverse outcomes. Thus, it is crucial to discover predictive markers of serious complications. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analysed samples from 455 participants with COVID-19 who had had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result between April 14, 2020, and Dec 1, 2020 and who had visited one of three Mayo Clinic sites in the USA (Minnesota, Arizona, or Florida) in the same period. These participants were assigned to three subgroups depending on disease severity as defined by the WHO ordinal scale of clinical improvement (outpatient, severe, or critical). Our control cohort comprised of 182 anonymised age-matched and sex-matched plasma samples that were available from the Mayo Clinic Biorepository and banked before the COVID-19 pandemic. We did a deep profiling of circulatory cytokines and other proteins, lipids, and metabolites from both cohorts. Most patient samples were collected before, or around the time of, hospital admission, representing ideal samples for predictive biomarker discovery. We used proximity extension assays to quantify cytokines and circulatory proteins and tandem mass spectrometry to measure lipids and metabolites. Biomarker discovery was done by applying an AutoGluon-tabular classifier to a multiomics dataset, producing a stacked ensemble of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. Global proteomics and glycoproteomics on a subset of patient samples with matched pre-COVID-19 plasma samples was also done. Findings: We quantified 1463 cytokines and circulatory proteins, along with 902 lipids and 1018 metabolites. By developing a machine-learning-based prediction model, a set of 102 biomarkers, which predicted severe and clinical COVID-19 outcomes better than the traditional set of cytokines, were discovered. These predictive biomarkers included several novel cytokines and other proteins, lipids, and metabolites. For example, altered amounts of C-type lectin domain family 6 member A (CLEC6A), ether phosphatidylethanolamine (P-18:1/18:1), and 2-hydroxydecanoate, as reported here, have not previously been associated with severity in COVID-19. Patient samples with matched pre-COVID-19 plasma samples showed similar trends in muti-omics signatures along with differences in glycoproteomics profile. Interpretation: A multiomic molecular signature in the plasma of patients with COVID-19 before being admitted to hospital can be exploited to predict a more severe course of disease. Machine learning approaches can be applied to highly complex and multidimensional profiling data to reveal novel signatures of clinical use. The absence of validation in an independent cohort remains a major limitation of the study. Funding: Eric and Wendy Schmidt. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting effectiveness of telemedicine interventions for the management of patients with cardiovascular conditions. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library from database inception to Jan 18, 2021. We included randomised controlled trials and observational or cohort studies that evaluated the effects of a telemedicine intervention on cardiovascular outcomes for people either at risk (primary prevention) of cardiovascular disease or with established (secondary prevention) cardiovascular disease, and, for the meta-analysis, we included studies that evaluated the effects of a telemedicine intervention on cardiovascular outcomes and risk factors. We excluded studies if there was no clear telemedicine intervention described or if cardiovascular or risk factor outcomes were not clearly reported in relation to the intervention. Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted data from trials and observational and cohort studies using a standardised template. Our primary outcome was cardiovascular-related mortality. We evaluated study quality using Cochrane risk-of-bias and Newcastle-Ottawa scales. The systematic review and the meta-analysis protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021221010) and the Malaysian National Medical Research Register (NMRR-20–2471–57236). Findings: 72 studies, including 127 869 participants, met eligibility criteria, with 34 studies included in meta-analysis (n=13 269 with 6620 [50%] receiving telemedicine). Combined remote monitoring and consultation for patients with heart failure was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular-related mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0·83 [95% CI 0·70 to 0·99]; p=0·036) and hospitalisation for a cardiovascular cause (0·71 [0·58 to 0·87]; p=0·0002), mostly in studies with short-term follow-up. There was no effect of telemedicine on all-cause hospitalisation (1·02 [0·94 to 1·10]; p=0·71) or mortality (0·90 [0·77 to 1·06]; p=0·23) in these groups, and no benefits were observed with remote consultation in isolation. Small reductions were observed for systolic blood pressure (mean difference –3·59 [95% CI –5·35 to –1·83] mm Hg; p<0·0001) by remote monitoring and consultation in secondary prevention populations. Small reductions were also observed in body-mass index (mean difference –0·38 [–0·66 to –0·11] kg/m2; p=0·0064) by remote consultation in primary prevention settings. Interpretation: Telemedicine including both remote disease monitoring and consultation might reduce short-term cardiovascular-related hospitalisation and mortality risk among patients with heart failure. Future research should evaluate the sustained effects of telemedicine interventions. Funding: The British Heart Foundation. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, research in such interventions delivered online is scarce. We evaluated the effectiveness of a digital multicomponent intervention—COPe-support—in improving carers' mental wellbeing and caregiving-related outcomes. Methods: In this two-arm, individually randomised, superiority trial, people aged 18 years or older who provided at least weekly support in any format for a relative or close friend affected by psychosis across England were randomly assigned (1:1) to either COPe-support or a passive online information resource using an independent online system. Participants were recruited through 30 mental health UK National Health Service trusts. The study team were masked to allocation and assessment of outcomes as all data collection took place online. Participants had access to either condition for 40 weeks and were advised to spend at least half an hour per week over the initial 20 weeks to go through materials at their own pace and to allow time to integrate knowledge and skills learned into practice. It was not feasible to mask participants or the online facilitator to intervention allocation. COPe-support provided psychoeducation on psychosis-related caregiving strategies and forums with professionals and other carers, and the control intervention comprised a passive online information resource. The primary outcome at 20 weeks was mental wellbeing measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS; minimally clinically important difference [MCID] 3). This trial is registered with ISRCTN, 89563420. Findings: Between March 1, 2018, and Feb 14, 2020, 407 participants were randomly assigned, with 204 allocated to COPe-support and 203 allocated to control. The participants (mean age 53·1 years, SD 13·2) were mostly female (330 [81%] of 407 participants) and White (359 [88%] of 407 participants). 346 (85%) of 407 participants provided primary endpoint data, 174 (85%) of 204 participants in the COPe-support group and 172 (85%) of 203 participants in the control group. The mean WEMWBS score at 20 weeks was 44·5 (SD 8·31) for the COPe-support group and 43·3 (9·19) for the control group. We found no evidence of a difference in wellbeing between the two groups (adjusted mean difference 0·37, 95% CI –1·14 to 1·88; p=0·63). In the COPe-support group, 106 (52%) of 204 participants met the complier definition of a minimum of two logins in separate weeks. The complier average causal effect analysis increased the difference in WEMWBS scores (adjusted difference 0·83, 95% CI –1·45 to 3·11; p=0·47), but this was lower than the MCID. There were no adverse events. Interpretation: Our findings did not support the use of COPe-support over a passive online information resource. However, further research to optimise digital interventions adjunctive to face-to-face support for carers remains important. Funding: National Institute for Health Research. © 2022 The Author(s).

We aimed to evaluate the adoption of corticosteroids in the treatment of COVID-19 in the UK after the RECOVERY trial publication on June 16, 2020, and to identify discrepancies in care. Methods: We did an audit of clinical implementation of corticosteroids in a prospective, observational, cohort study in 237 UK acute care hospitals between March 16, 2020, and April 14, 2021, restricted to patients aged 18 years or older with proven or high likelihood of COVID-19, who received supplementary oxygen. The primary outcome was administration of dexamethasone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, or methylprednisolone. This study is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN66726260. Findings: Between June 17, 2020, and April 14, 2021, 47 795 (75·2%) of 63 525 of patients on supplementary oxygen received corticosteroids, higher among patients requiring critical care than in those who received ward care (11 185 [86·6%] of 12 909 vs 36 415 [72·4%] of 50 278). Patients 50 years or older were significantly less likely to receive corticosteroids than those younger than 50 years (adjusted odds ratio 0·79 [95% CI 0·70–0·89], p=0·0001, for 70–79 years; 0·52 [0·46–0·58], p<0·0001, for >80 years), independent of patient demographics and illness severity. 84 (54·2%) of 155 pregnant women received corticosteroids. Rates of corticosteroid administration increased from 27·5% in the week before June 16, 2020, to 75–80% in January, 2021. Interpretation: Implementation of corticosteroids into clinical practice in the UK for patients with COVID-19 has been successful, but not universal. Patients older than 70 years, independent of illness severity, chronic neurological disease, and dementia, were less likely to receive corticosteroids than those who were younger, as were pregnant women. This could reflect appropriate clinical decision making, but the possibility of inequitable access to life-saving care should be considered.

We aimed to simulate these real-world scenarios and evaluate the effects of image source institution, diagnoses outside of the training set, and other image artifacts on classification accuracy, with the goal of informing clinicians and regulatory agencies about safety and real-world accuracy. Methods: We designed a large dermoscopic image classification challenge to quantify the performance of machine learning algorithms for the task of skin cancer classification from dermoscopic images, and how this performance is affected by shifts in statistical distributions of data, disease categories not represented in training datasets, and imaging or lesion artifacts. Factors that might be beneficial to performance, such as clinical metadata and external training data collected by challenge participants, were also evaluated. 25 331 training images collected from two datasets (in Vienna [HAM10000] and Barcelona [BCN20000]) between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2018, across eight skin diseases, were provided to challenge participants to design appropriate algorithms. The trained algorithms were then tested for balanced accuracy against the HAM10000 and BCN20000 test datasets and data from countries not included in the training dataset (Turkey, New Zealand, Sweden, and Argentina). Test datasets contained images of all diagnostic categories available in training plus other diagnoses not included in training data (not trained category). We compared the performance of the algorithms against that of 18 dermatologists in a simulated setting that reflected intended clinical use. Findings: 64 teams submitted 129 state-of-the-art algorithm predictions on a test set of 8238 images. The best performing algorithm achieved 58·8% balanced accuracy on the BCN20000 data, which was designed to better reflect realistic clinical scenarios, compared with 82·0% balanced accuracy on HAM10000, which was used in a previously published benchmark. Shifted statistical distributions and disease categories not included in training data contributed to decreases in accuracy. Image artifacts, including hair, pen markings, ulceration, and imaging source institution, decreased accuracy in a complex manner that varied based on the underlying diagnosis. When comparing algorithms to expert dermatologists (2460 ratings on 1269 images), algorithms performed better than experts in most categories, except for actinic keratoses (similar accuracy on average) and images from categories not included in training data (26% correct for experts vs 6% correct for algorithms, p<0·0001). For the top 25 submitted algorithms, 47·1% of the images from categories not included in training data were misclassified as malignant diagnoses, which would lead to a substantial number of unnecessary biopsies if current state-of-the-art AI technologies were clinically deployed. Interpretation: We have identified specific deficiencies and safety issues in AI diagnostic systems for skin cancer that should be addressed in future diagnostic evaluation protocols to improve safety and reliability in clinical practice.

We aimed to assess the associations between health conditions diagnosed in primary care and the risk of incident Alzheimer's disease over time, up to 15 years before a first Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Methods: In this agnostic study of French and British health records, data from 20 214 patients with Alzheimer's disease in the UK and 19 458 patients with Alzheimer's disease in France were extracted from The Health Improvement Network database. We considered data recorded from Jan 1, 1996, to March 31, 2020 in the UK and from Jan 4, 1998, to Feb 20, 2019, in France. For each Alzheimer's disease case, a control was randomly assigned after matching for sex and age at last visit. We agnostically tested the associations between 123 different diagnoses of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, extracted from health records, and Alzheimer's disease, by running a conditional logistic regression to account for matching of cases and controls. We focused on three time periods before diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, to separate risk factors from early symptoms and comorbidities. Findings: Unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for the association between Alzheimer's disease and various health conditions were estimated, and p values were corrected for multiple comparisons. In both the British and French studies, ten health conditions were significantly positively associated with increased Alzheimer's disease risk, in a window of exposure from 2–10 years before Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, comprising major depressive disorder (UK OR 1·34, 95% CI 1·23–1·46; France OR 1·73, 1·57–1·91), anxiety (UK OR 1·36, 1·25–1·47; France OR 1·50, 1·36–1·65), reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorders (UK OR 1·40, 1·24–1·59; France OR 1·83, 1·55–2·15), hearing loss (UK OR 1·19, 1·11–1·28; France OR 1·51, 1·21–1·89), constipation (UK OR 1·31, 1·22–1·41; France OR 1·59, 1·44–1·75), spondylosis (UK OR 1·26, 1·14–1·39; France OR 1·62, 1·44–1·81), abnormal weight loss (UK OR 1·47, 1·33–1·63; France OR 1·88, 1·56–2·26), malaise and fatigue (UK OR 1·23, 1·14–1·32; France OR 1·59, 1·46–1·73), memory loss (UK OR 7·63, 6·65–8·76; France OR 4·41, 3·07–6·34), and syncope and collapse (UK OR 1·23, 1·10–1·37; France OR 1·57, 1·26–1·96). Depression was the first comorbid condition associated with Alzheimer's disease, appearing at least 9 years before the first clinical diagnosis, followed by anxiety, constipation, and abnormal weight loss. Interpretation: These results from two independent primary care databases provide new evidence on the temporality of risk factors and early signs of Alzheimer's disease that are observable at the general practitioner level. These results could guide the implementation of new primary and secondary prevention policies. Funding: Agence Nationale de la Recherche. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Our objective was to evaluate the safety and efficiency of the Diabeloop DBL4K (Diabeloop, Grenoble, France) hybrid closed-loop system in prepubescent children. Methods: We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority, two-session crossover study in the paediatric endocrinology departments of three university hospitals in France and Belgium. Eligible participants were aged 6–12 years with type 1 diabetes for at least 1 year, glycated haemoglobin A1C 9% (75 mmol/mol) or less, and insulin pump treatment for at least 3 months. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to a closed-loop device or sensor-augmented pump (open loop) therapy. Randomisation was by a permuted block randomisation scheme, using an interactive web-based response system, and was stratified on centre (block size 6). The assessed closed-loop device, the Diabeloop for Kids DBL4K hybrid closed-loop system, is an automated blood glucose regulation system composed of a handset, insulin pump, and continuous glucose monitor. The open-loop system is defined as a sensor-augmented pump therapy composed of the usual insulin pump used by the patient and a continuous glucose monitor. A 72-h in-patient period was followed by a 6-week home phase. After a 1-week washout period, the participants crossed over to the other device. The primary outcome, assessed in the intention-to-treat population, was the mean proportion of time spent in hypoglycaemia (3·9 mmol/L [<70 mg/dL]) during the hospital phase, with a non-inferiority margin of –2·5% (absolute value). Safety was assessed in the intention-to-treat population on a per-protocol basis. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03671915. Findings: Between May 6 and Dec 23, 2019, we included 21 participants (closed loop then open loop, n=10; open loop then closed loop, n=11). The proportion of time spent in hypoglycaemia was significantly lower with the closed-loop system than the open-loop system in both groups (2·04% [95% CI 0·44 to 3·64] vs 7·06% [5·46 to 8·66]; non-inferiority one-sided p<0·0001). No severe ketoacidosis, nor severe hyoglycaemic events or fatal adverse events occurred. All 25 adverse events (18 with the closed-loop system, seven with the open-loop system) were related to the treatment. Interpretation: The closed-loop Diabeloop system decreased hypoglycaemic episodes and provided good metabolic control in prepubescent children with type 1 diabetes, under real-life conditions. This finding supports the safe use of closed-loop technology in this paediatric population. Funding: Diabeloop.

We sought to develop and validate a deep learning system for CCTA-derived measures of plaque volume and stenosis severity. Methods: This international, multicentre study included nine cohorts of patients undergoing CCTA at 11 sites, who were assigned into training and test sets. Data were retrospectively collected on patients with a wide range of clinical presentations of coronary artery disease who underwent CCTA between Nov 18, 2010, and Jan 25, 2019. A novel deep learning convolutional neural network was trained to segment coronary plaque in 921 patients (5045 lesions). The deep learning network was then applied to an independent test set, which included an external validation cohort of 175 patients (1081 lesions) and 50 patients (84 lesions) assessed by intravascular ultrasound within 1 month of CCTA. We evaluated the prognostic value of deep learning-based plaque measurements for fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction (our primary outcome) in 1611 patients from the prospective SCOT-HEART trial, assessed as dichotomous variables using multivariable Cox regression analysis, with adjustment for the ASSIGN clinical risk score. Findings: In the overall test set, there was excellent or good agreement, respectively, between deep learning and expert reader measurements of total plaque volume (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 0·964) and percent diameter stenosis (ICC 0·879; both p<0·0001). When compared with intravascular ultrasound, there was excellent agreement for deep learning total plaque volume (ICC 0·949) and minimal luminal area (ICC 0·904). The mean per-patient deep learning plaque analysis time was 5·65 s (SD 1·87) versus 25·66 min (6·79) taken by experts. Over a median follow-up of 4·7 years (IQR 4·0–5·7), myocardial infarction occurred in 41 (2·5%) of 1611 patients from the SCOT-HEART trial. A deep learning-based total plaque volume of 238·5 mm3 or higher was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR] 5·36, 95% CI 1·70–16·86; p=0·0042) after adjustment for the presence of deep learning-based obstructive stenosis (HR 2·49, 1·07–5·50; p=0·0089) and the ASSIGN clinical risk score (HR 1·01, 0·99–1·04; p=0·35). Interpretation: Our novel, externally validated deep learning system provides rapid measurements of plaque volume and stenosis severity from CCTA that agree closely with expert readers and intravascular ultrasound, and could have prognostic value for future myocardial infarction.

However, manual interpretation of echocardiograms can be time consuming and subject to human error. Therefore, we developed a fully automated deep learning workflow to classify, segment, and annotate two-dimensional (2D) videos and Doppler modalities in echocardiograms. Methods: We developed the workflow using a training dataset of 1145 echocardiograms and an internal test set of 406 echocardiograms from the prospective heart failure research platform (Asian Network for Translational Research and Cardiovascular Trials; ATTRaCT) in Asia, with previous manual tracings by expert sonographers. We validated the workflow against manual measurements in a curated dataset from Canada (Alberta Heart Failure Etiology and Analysis Research Team; HEART; n=1029 echocardiograms), a real-world dataset from Taiwan (n=31 241), the US-based EchoNet-Dynamic dataset (n=10 030), and in an independent prospective assessment of the Asian (ATTRaCT) and Canadian (Alberta HEART) datasets (n=142) with repeated independent measurements by two expert sonographers. Findings: In the ATTRaCT test set, the automated workflow classified 2D videos and Doppler modalities with accuracies (number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions) ranging from 0·91 to 0·99. Segmentations of the left ventricle and left atrium were accurate, with a mean Dice similarity coefficient greater than 93% for all. In the external datasets (n=1029 to 10 030 echocardiograms used as input), automated measurements showed good agreement with locally measured values, with a mean absolute error range of 9–25 mL for left ventricular volumes, 6–10% for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and 1·8–2·2 for the ratio of the mitral inflow E wave to the tissue Doppler e' wave (E/e' ratio); and reliably classified systolic dysfunction (LVEF <40%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] range 0·90–0·92) and diastolic dysfunction (E/e' ratio ≥13, AUC range 0·91–0·91), with narrow 95% CIs for AUC values. Independent prospective evaluation confirmed less variance of automated compared with human expert measurements, with all individual equivalence coefficients being less than 0 for all measurements. Interpretation: Deep learning algorithms can automatically annotate 2D videos and Doppler modalities with similar accuracy to manual measurements by expert sonographers. Use of an automated workflow might accelerate access, improve quality, and reduce costs in diagnosing and managing heart failure globally.

However, most studies remain confined to in silico validation in small internal cohorts, without external validation or data on real-world clinical utility. We developed a strategy for the clinical validation of deep learning models for segmenting primary non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours and involved lymph nodes in CT images, which is a time-intensive step in radiation treatment planning, with large variability among experts. Methods: In this observational study, CT images and segmentations were collected from eight internal and external sources from the USA, the Netherlands, Canada, and China, with patients from the Maastro and Harvard-RT1 datasets used for model discovery (segmented by a single expert). Validation consisted of interobserver and intraobserver benchmarking, primary validation, functional validation, and end-user testing on the following datasets: multi-delineation, Harvard-RT1, Harvard-RT2, RTOG-0617, NSCLC-radiogenomics, Lung-PET-CT-Dx, RIDER, and thorax phantom. Primary validation consisted of stepwise testing on increasingly external datasets using measures of overlap including volumetric dice (VD) and surface dice (SD). Functional validation explored dosimetric effect, model failure modes, test-retest stability, and accuracy. End-user testing with eight experts assessed automated segmentations in a simulated clinical setting. Findings: We included 2208 patients imaged between 2001 and 2015, with 787 patients used for model discovery and 1421 for model validation, including 28 patients for end-user testing. Models showed an improvement over the interobserver benchmark (multi-delineation dataset; VD 0·91 [IQR 0·83–0·92], p=0·0062; SD 0·86 [0·71–0·91], p=0·0005), and were within the intraobserver benchmark. For primary validation, AI performance on internal Harvard-RT1 data (segmented by the same expert who segmented the discovery data) was VD 0·83 (IQR 0·76–0·88) and SD 0·79 (0·68–0·88), within the interobserver benchmark. Performance on internal Harvard-RT2 data segmented by other experts was VD 0·70 (0·56–0·80) and SD 0·50 (0·34–0·71). Performance on RTOG-0617 clinical trial data was VD 0·71 (0·60–0·81) and SD 0·47 (0·35–0·59), with similar results on diagnostic radiology datasets NSCLC-radiogenomics and Lung-PET-CT-Dx. Despite these geometric overlap results, models yielded target volumes with equivalent radiation dose coverage to those of experts. We also found non-significant differences between de novo expert and AI-assisted segmentations. AI assistance led to a 65% reduction in segmentation time (5·4 min; p<0·0001) and a 32% reduction in interobserver variability (SD; p=0·013). Interpretation: We present a clinical validation strategy for AI models. We found that in silico geometric segmentation metrics might not correlate with clinical utility of the models. Experts' segmentation style and preference might affect model performance. Funding: US National Institutes of Health and EU European Research Council. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This systematic review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (umbrella review) aimed to examine the effectiveness of activity trackers for improving physical activity and related physiological and psychosocial outcomes in clinical and non-clinical populations. Seven databases (Embase, MEDLINE, Ovid Emcare, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) were searched from database inception to April 8, 2021. Systematic reviews of primary studies using activity trackers as interventions and reporting physical activity, physiological, or psychosocial outcomes were eligible for inclusion. In total, 39 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were identified, reporting results from 163 992 participants spanning all age groups, from both healthy and clinical populations. Taken together, the meta-analyses suggested activity trackers improved physical activity (standardised mean difference [SMD] 0·3–0·6), body composition (SMD 0·7–2·0), and fitness (SMD 0·3), equating to approximately 1800 extra steps per day, 40 min per day more walking, and reductions of approximately 1 kg in bodyweight. Effects for other physiological (blood pressure, cholesterol, and glycosylated haemoglobin) and psychosocial (quality of life and pain) outcomes were typically small and often non-significant. Activity trackers appear to be effective at increasing physical activity in a variety of age groups and clinical and non-clinical populations. The benefit is clinically important and is sustained over time. Based on the studies evaluated, there is sufficient evidence to recommend the use of activity trackers. © 2022 The Author(s).

Genetic information allows for the stratification of genetic predispositions and lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. However, towards clinical application, the added value over clinical predictors later in life is crucial. Currently, this genotype–phenotype relationship and implications for overall cardiovascular risk are unclear. Methods: In this study, we developed and validated a neural network-based risk model (NeuralCVD) integrating polygenic and clinical predictors in 395 713 cardiovascular disease-free participants from the UK Biobank cohort. The primary outcome was the first record of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE) within 10 years. We compared the NeuralCVD model with both established clinical scores (SCORE, ASCVD, and QRISK3 recalibrated to the UK Biobank cohort) and a linear Cox-Model, assessing risk discrimination, net reclassification, and calibration over 22 spatially distinct recruitment centres. Findings: The NeuralCVD score was well calibrated and improved on the best clinical baseline, QRISK3 (ΔConcordance index [C-index] 0·01, 95% CI 0·009–0·011; net reclassification improvement (NRI) 0·0488, 95% CI 0·0442–0·0534) and a Cox model (ΔC-index 0·003, 95% CI 0·002–0·004; NRI 0·0469, 95% CI 0·0429–0·0511) in risk discrimination and net reclassification. After adding polygenic scores we found further improvements on population level (ΔC-index 0·006, 95% CI 0·005–0·007; NRI 0·0116, 95% CI 0·0066–0·0159). Additionally, we identified an interaction of genetic information with the pre-existing clinical phenotype, not captured by conventional models. Additional high polygenic risk increased overall risk most in individuals with low to intermediate clinical risk, and age younger than 50 years. Interpretation: Our results demonstrated that the NeuralCVD score can estimate cardiovascular risk trajectories for primary prevention. NeuralCVD learns the transition of predictive information from genotype to phenotype and identifies individuals with high genetic predisposition before developing a severe clinical phenotype. This finding could improve the reprioritisation of otherwise low-risk individuals with a high genetic cardiovascular predisposition for preventive interventions.

Deep learning is making advances in image-recognition tasks; therefore, we aimed to develop a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model that automates evaluation of ultrasound images and to facilitate a more accurate diagnosis of ovarian cancer than existing methods. Methods: In this retrospective, multicentre, diagnostic study, we collected pelvic ultrasound images from ten hospitals across China between September 2003, and May 2019. We included consecutive adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with adnexal lesions in ultrasonography and healthy controls and excluded duplicated cases and patients without adnexa or pathological diagnosis. For DCNN model development, patients were assigned to the training dataset (34 488 images of 3755 patients with ovarian cancer, 541 442 images of 101 777 controls). For model validation, patients were assigned to the internal validation dataset (3031 images of 266 patients with ovarian cancer, 5385 images of 602 with benign adnexal lesions), external validation datasets 1 (486 images of 67 with ovarian cancer, 933 images of 268 with benign adnexal lesions), and 2 (1253 images of 166 with ovarian cancer, 5257 images of 723 benign adnexal lesions). Using these datasets, we assessed the diagnostic value of DCNN, compared DCNN with 35 radiologists, and explored whether DCNN could augment the diagnostic accuracy of six radiologists. Pathological diagnosis was the reference standard. Findings: For DCNN to detect ovarian cancer, AUC was 0·911 (95% CI 0·886–0·936) in the internal dataset, 0·870 (95% CI 0·822–0·918) in external validation dataset 1, and 0·831 (95% CI 0·793–0·869) in external validation dataset 2. The DCNN model was more accurate than radiologists at detecting ovarian cancer in the internal dataset (88·8% vs 85·7%) and external validation dataset 1 (86·9% vs 81·1%). Accuracy and sensitivity of diagnosis increased more after DCNN-assisted diagnosis than assessment by radiologists alone (87·6% [85·0–90·2] vs 78·3% [72·1–84·5], p<0·0001; 82·7% [78·5–86·9] vs 70·4% [59·1–81·7], p<0·0001). The average accuracy of DCNN-assisted evaluations for six radiologists reached 0·876 and were significantly augmented when they were DCNN-assisted (p<0·05). Interpretation: The performance of DCNN-enabled ultrasound exceeded the average diagnostic level of radiologists matched the level of expert ultrasound image readers, and augmented radiologists’ accuracy. However, these observations warrant further investigations in prospective studies or randomised clinical trials.

Deep-learning systems have the potential to enhance diabetic retinopathy screenings in these settings, yet prospective studies assessing their usability and performance are scarce. Methods: We did a prospective interventional cohort study to evaluate the real-world performance and feasibility of deploying a deep-learning system into the health-care system of Thailand. Patients with diabetes and listed on the national diabetes registry, aged 18 years or older, able to have their fundus photograph taken for at least one eye, and due for screening as per the Thai Ministry of Public Health guidelines were eligible for inclusion. Eligible patients were screened with the deep-learning system at nine primary care sites under Thailand's national diabetic retinopathy screening programme. Patients with a previous diagnosis of diabetic macular oedema, severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or proliferative diabetic retinopathy; previous laser treatment of the retina or retinal surgery; other non-diabetic retinopathy eye disease requiring referral to an ophthalmologist; or inability to have fundus photograph taken of both eyes for any reason were excluded. Deep-learning system-based interpretations of patient fundus images and referral recommendations were provided in real time. As a safety mechanism, regional retina specialists over-read each image. Performance of the deep-learning system (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV], and negative predictive value [NPV]) were measured against an adjudicated reference standard, provided by fellowship-trained retina specialists. This study is registered with the Thai national clinical trials registry, TCRT20190902002. Findings: Between Dec 12, 2018, and March 29, 2020, 7940 patients were screened for inclusion. 7651 (96·3%) patients were eligible for study analysis, and 2412 (31·5%) patients were referred for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular oedema, ungradable images, or low visual acuity. For vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, the deep-learning system had an accuracy of 94·7% (95% CI 93·0–96·2), sensitivity of 91·4% (87·1–95·0), and specificity of 95·4% (94·1–96·7). The retina specialist over-readers had an accuracy of 93·5 (91·7–95·0; p=0·17), a sensitivity of 84·8% (79·4–90·0; p=0·024), and specificity of 95·5% (94·1–96·7; p=0·98). The PPV for the deep-learning system was 79·2 (95% CI 73·8–84·3) compared with 75·6 (69·8–81·1) for the over-readers. The NPV for the deep-learning system was 95·5 (92·8–97·9) compared with 92·4 (89·3–95·5) for the over-readers. Interpretation: A deep-learning system can deliver real-time diabetic retinopathy detection capability similar to retina specialists in community-based screening settings. Socioenvironmental factors and workflows must be taken into consideration when implementing a deep-learning system within a large-scale screening programme in LMICs.

Evidence-based treatments exist, but accessible treatment alternatives are needed. We aimed to compare internet-based psychodynamic therapy (IPDT) with an established evidence-based treatment (internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy [ICBT]) for the treatment of adolescents with depression. Methods: In this randomised, clinical trial, we tested whether IPDT was non-inferior to ICBT in the treatment of adolescent MDD. Eligible participants were 15–19 years old, presenting with a primary diagnosis of MDD according to DSM-5. Participants were recruited nationwide in Sweden through advertisements on social media, as well as contacts with junior and senior high schools, youth associations, social workers, and health-care providers. Adolescents who scored 9 or higher on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology for Adolescents (QIDS-A17-SR) in an initial online screening were contacted by telephone for a diagnostic assessment using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Participants were randomly assigned to ICBT or IPDT. Both interventions comprised eight self-help modules delivered over 10 weeks on a secure online platform. The primary outcome was change in depression severity measured weekly by the QIDS-A17-SR. Primary analyses were based on an intention-to-treat sample including all participants randomly assigned. A non-inferiority margin of Cohen's d=0·30 was predefined. The study is registered at ISRCTN, ISRCTN12552584. Findings: Between Aug 19, 2019, and Oct 7, 2020, 996 young people completed screening; 516 (52%) were contacted for a diagnostic interview. 272 participants were eligible and randomly assigned to ICBT (n=136) or IPDT (n=136). In the ICBT group, 51 (38%) of 136 participants were classified as remitted, and 54 (40%) of 136 participants were classified as remitted in the IPDT group. Within-group effects were large (ICBT: within-group d=1·75, 95% CI 1·49 to 2·01; IPDT: within-group d=1·93, 1·67 to 2·20; both p<0·0001). No statistically significant treatment difference was found in the intention-to-treat analysis. Non-inferiority for IPDT was shown for the estimated change in depression during treatment (d=–0·18, 90% CI –0·49 to 0·13; p=0·34). All secondary outcomes showed non-significant between-group differences. Interpretation: IPDT was non-inferior to ICBT in terms of change in depression for the treatment of adolescents with MDD.

Importantly, not all patients with an EGFR mutation have good prognosis with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), indicating the necessity of stratifying for EGFR-mutant genotype. In this study, we proposed a fully automated artificial intelligence system (FAIS) that mines whole-lung information from CT images to predict EGFR genotype and prognosis with EGFR-TKI treatment. Methods: We included 18 232 patients with lung cancer with CT imaging and EGFR gene sequencing from nine cohorts in China and the USA, including a prospective cohort in an Asian population (n=891) and The Cancer Imaging Archive cohort in a White population. These cohorts were divided into thick CT group and thin CT group. The FAIS was built for predicting EGFR genotype and progression-free survival of patients receiving EGFR-TKIs, and it was evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) and Kaplan-Meier analysis. We further built two tumour-based deep learning models as comparison with the FAIS, and we explored the value of combining FAIS and clinical factors (the FAIS-C model). Additionally, we included 891 patients with 56-panel next-generation sequencing and 87 patients with RNA sequencing data to explore the biological mechanisms of FAIS. Findings: FAIS achieved AUCs ranging from 0·748 to 0·813 in the six retrospective and prospective testing cohorts, outperforming the commonly used tumour-based deep learning model. Genotype predicted by the FAIS-C model was significantly associated with prognosis to EGFR-TKIs treatment (log-rank p<0·05), an important complement to gene sequencing. Moreover, we found 29 prognostic deep learning features in FAIS that were able to identify patients with an EGFR mutation at high risk of TKI resistance. These features showed strong associations with multiple genotypes (p<0·05, t test or Wilcoxon test) and gene pathways linked to drug resistance and cancer progression mechanisms. Interpretation: FAIS provides a non-invasive method to detect EGFR genotype and identify patients with an EGFR mutation at high risk of TKI resistance. The superior performance of FAIS over tumour-based deep learning methods suggests that genotype and prognostic information could be obtained from the whole lung instead of only tumour tissues.

Artificial intelligence might offer improved diagnostic accuracy for these fractures, but typical approaches to testing of artificial intelligence models can underestimate the risks of artificial intelligence-based diagnostic systems. Methods: We present a preclinical evaluation of a deep learning model intended to detect proximal femoral fractures in frontal x-ray films in emergency department patients, trained on films from the Royal Adelaide Hospital (Adelaide, SA, Australia). This evaluation included a reader study comparing the performance of the model against five radiologists (three musculoskeletal specialists and two general radiologists) on a dataset of 200 fracture cases and 200 non-fractures (also from the Royal Adelaide Hospital), an external validation study using a dataset obtained from Stanford University Medical Center, CA, USA, and an algorithmic audit to detect any unusual or unexpected model behaviour. Findings: In the reader study, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the performance of the deep learning model was 0·994 (95% CI 0·988–0·999) compared with an AUC of 0·969 (0·960–0·978) for the five radiologists. This strong model performance was maintained on external validation, with an AUC of 0·980 (0·931–1·000). However, the preclinical evaluation identified barriers to safe deployment, including a substantial shift in the model operating point on external validation and an increased error rate on cases with abnormal bones (eg, Paget's disease). Interpretation: The model outperformed the radiologists tested and maintained performance on external validation, but showed several unexpected limitations during further testing. Thorough preclinical evaluation of artificial intelligence models, including algorithmic auditing, can reveal unexpected and potentially harmful behaviour even in high-performance artificial intelligence systems, which can inform future clinical testing and deployment decisions.

Algorithmic assessments with high certainty are done automatically, whereas assessments with lower certainty are referred to the radiologist. This two-part AI system can triage normal mammography exams and provide post-hoc cancer detection to maintain a high degree of sensitivity. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of this AI system on sensitivity and specificity when used either as a standalone system or within a decision-referral approach, compared with the original radiologist decision. Methods: We used a retrospective dataset consisting of 1 193 197 full-field, digital mammography studies carried out between Jan 1, 2007, and Dec 31, 2020, from eight screening sites participating in the German national breast-cancer screening programme. We derived an internal-test dataset from six screening sites (1670 screen-detected cancers and 19 997 normal mammography exams), and an external-test dataset of breast cancer screening exams (2793 screen-detected cancers and 80 058 normal exams) from two additional screening sites to evaluate the performance of an AI algorithm on sensitivity and specificity when used either as a standalone system or within a decision-referral approach, compared with the original individual radiologist decision at the point-of-screen reading ahead of the consensus conference. Different configurations of the AI algorithm were evaluated. To account for the enrichment of the datasets caused by oversampling cancer cases, weights were applied to reflect the actual distribution of study types in the screening programme. Triaging performance was evaluated as the rate of exams correctly identified as normal. Sensitivity across clinically relevant subgroups, screening sites, and device manufacturers was compared between standalone AI, the radiologist, and decision referral. We present receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC (AUROC) to evaluate AI-system performance over its entire operating range. Comparison with radiologists and subgroup analysis was based on sensitivity and specificity at clinically relevant configurations. Findings: The exemplary configuration of the AI system in standalone mode achieved a sensitivity of 84·2% (95% CI 82·4–85·8) and a specificity of 89·5% (89·0–89·9) on internal-test data, and a sensitivity of 84·6% (83·3–85·9) and a specificity of 91·3% (91·1–91·5) on external-test data, but was less accurate than the average unaided radiologist. By contrast, the simulated decision-referral approach significantly improved upon radiologist sensitivity by 2·6 percentage points and specificity by 1·0 percentage points, corresponding to a triaging performance at 63·0% on the external dataset; the AUROC was 0·982 (95% CI 0·978–0·986) on the subset of studies assessed by AI, surpassing radiologist performance. The decision-referral approach also yielded significant increases in sensitivity for a number of clinically relevant subgroups, including subgroups of small lesion sizes and invasive carcinomas. Sensitivity of the decision-referral approach was consistent across the eight included screening sites and three device manufacturers. Interpretation: The decision-referral approach leverages the strengths of both the radiologist and AI, demonstrating improvements in sensitivity and specificity surpassing that of the individual radiologist and of the standalone AI system. This approach has the potential to improve the screening accuracy of radiologists, is adaptive to the requirements of screening, and could allow for the reduction of workload ahead of the consensus conference, without discarding the generalised knowledge of radiologists.

However, the total number of datasets and their respective content is currently unclear. This systematic review aimed to identify and evaluate all publicly available skin image datasets used for skin cancer diagnosis by exploring their characteristics, data access requirements, and associated image metadata. A combined MEDLINE, Google, and Google Dataset search identified 21 open access datasets containing 106 950 skin lesion images, 17 open access atlases, eight regulated access datasets, and three regulated access atlases. Images and accompanying data from open access datasets were evaluated by two independent reviewers. Among the 14 datasets that reported country of origin, most (11 [79%]) originated from Europe, North America, and Oceania exclusively. Most datasets (19 [91%]) contained dermoscopic images or macroscopic photographs only. Clinical information was available regarding age for 81 662 images (76·4%), sex for 82 848 (77·5%), and body site for 79 561 (74·4%). Subject ethnicity data were available for 1415 images (1·3%), and Fitzpatrick skin type data for 2236 (2·1%). There was limited and variable reporting of characteristics and metadata among datasets, with substantial under-representation of darker skin types. This is the first systematic review to characterise publicly available skin image datasets, highlighting limited applicability to real-life clinical settings and restricted population representation, precluding generalisability. Quality standards for characteristics and metadata reporting for skin image datasets are needed. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nursing staff's clinical assessment might improve the prediction of outcome and allow more efficient use of resources. We aimed to investigate whether the combination of clinical assessment and EWS would reduce the number of routine measurements without increasing mortality. Methods: We did a cluster-randomised, crossover, non-inferiority study at eight hospitals in Denmark. Patients aged 18 years or older, admitted for more than 24 h were included. Admissions to paediatric or obstetric wards were excluded. The participating hospitals were randomly assigned 1:1 to start as either intervention or control with subsequent crossover. Primary outcomes were 30-day all-cause mortality (non-inferiority margin=0·5%) and average number of EWS per day per patient. The intervention was implementation of the Individual EWS (I-EWS), in which nursing staff can adjust the calculated score on the basis of their clinical assessment of the patient. I-EWS was compared with the National Early Warning Score (NEWS). The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03690128 and is complete. Findings: Unique admissions longer than 24 h were included from Oct 15, 2018 to Sept 30, 2019. Of 90 964 patients assessed, n=46 470 were assigned to the I-EWS group and n=44 494 to the NEWS group. Mortality within 30 days was 4·6% for the I-EWS group, and 4·3% for the NEWS group (adjusted odds ratio 1·05 [95% CI 0·99–1·12], p=0·12). In subgroup analyses I-EWS showed increased 30-day mortality for hospitals that did I-EWS in fall–winter, which was probably due to seasonality, and within patients admitted in a surgical specialty. Overall risk difference was 0·22% (95% CI −0·04 to 0·48) meaning that the non-inferiority criteria were met. The average number of scorings per patient per day was reduced from 3·14 to 3·10 (ie, a relative reduction of 0·64% [95% CI −0·16 to −1·11], p=0·0084) in the I-EWS group. Interpretation: Including clinical assessment in I-EWS was feasible and overall non-inferior to the widely implemented NEWS in terms of all-cause mortality at 30 days, and the number of routine measurements was minimally reduced. However I-EWS should be used with caution in surgical patients.

The Palestinian public health system is implementing a digital maternal and child health eRegistry with clinical decision support. We aimed to compare the quality of antenatal care between clinics using the eRegistry and those using paper-based records. Methods: The eRegQual cluster-randomised controlled trial was done in primary health-care clinics offering routine antenatal care in the West Bank, Palestine. The intervention was the eRegistry with clinical decision support for antenatal care, implemented in District Health Information Systems 2 (DHIS2) Tracker software. 133 clinics forming 120 clusters were included and randomised; clusters were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the control (paper-based documentation) or intervention (eRegistry with clinical decision support) groups. The primary process outcomes were appropriate screening and management of anaemia, hypertension, and diabetes during pregnancy and foetal growth monitoring. The primary health outcome at delivery was a composite of moderate or severe anaemia; severe hypertension; large-for-gestational-age baby; malpresentation and small-for-gestational-age baby undetected before delivery. Data were analysed with mixed-effects logistic regression, accounting for clustering within clinics and pregnancies as appropriate. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN18008445). Findings: Between Jan 15 and Sept 15, 2017, 3219 pregnant women received care in the intervention clinics (n=60 clusters) and 3148 pregnant women received care in the control primary health-care clinics (n=59 clusters). Compared with the control group, the intervention led to higher guideline adherence for screening and management of anaemia (1535 [28·9%] of 5320 vs 2297 [44·3%] of 5182; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·88 [95% CI 1·52–2·32]), hypertension (7555 [94·7%] of 7982 vs 7314 [96·6%] of 7569; adjusted OR 1·62 [95% CI 1·29–2·05]), and gestational diabetes (1726 (39·7%) of 4348 vs 2189 (50·7%) of 4321; adjusted OR 1·45 [95% CI 1·14–1·83]) at eligible antenatal contacts. Only 599 (9·4%) of 6367 women attended the full antenatal care schedule, and better care provision did not translate to fewer adverse health outcomes in the intervention clusters (700 cases; 21·7%) compared to the control clusters (688 cases; 21·9%; adjusted OR 0·99; 95% CI 0·87–1·12). Interpretation: Clinical decision support for antenatal care in the eRegistry was superior for most process outcomes but had no effect on the adverse health outcomes. The improvements in process outcomes strengthen the evidence for the WHO guideline for digital client tracking with clinical decision support in lower-middle-income settings. Digital health interventions to address gaps in attendance might help achieve effective coverage of antenatal care. Funding: European Research Council and Research Council of Norway.

In this study, we evaluated the risk of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on birth outcomes and how this is modulated by the pregnancy trimester in which the infection occurs. We also developed models to predict gestational age at delivery for people following a SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Methods: We did a retrospective cohort study of the impact of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on birth outcomes. We used clinical data from Providence St Joseph Health electronic health records for pregnant people who delivered in the USA at the Providence, Swedish, or Kadlec sites in Alaska, California, Montana, Oregon, or Washington. The SARS-CoV-2 positive cohort included people who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based test during pregnancy, subdivided by trimester of infection. No one in this cohort had been vaccinated for COVID-19 at time of infection. The SARS-CoV-2 negative cohort were people with at least one negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based test and no positive tests during pregnancy. Cohorts were matched on common covariates impacting birth outcomes, and univariate and multivariate analysis were done to investigate risk factors and predict outcomes. The primary outcome was gestational age at delivery with annotation of preterm birth classification. We trained multiple supervised learning models on 24 features of the SARS-CoV-2 positive cohort to evaluate performance and feature importance for each model and discuss the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on gestational age at delivery. Findings: Between March 5, 2020, and July 4, 2021, 73 666 pregnant people delivered, 18 335 of whom had at least one SARS-CoV-2 test during pregnancy before Feb 14, 2021. We observed 882 people infected with SARS-CoV-2 during their pregnancy (first trimester n=85; second trimester n=226; and third trimester n=571) and 19 769 people who have never tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and received at least one negative SARS-CoV-2 test during their pregnancy. SARS-CoV-2 infection indicated an increased risk of preterm delivery (p<0·05) and stillbirth (p<0·05), accounted for primarily by first and second trimester SARS-CoV-2 infections. Gestational age at SARS-CoV-2 infection was correlated with gestational age at delivery (p<0·01) and had the greatest impact on predicting gestational age at delivery. The people in this study had mild or moderate SARS-CoV-2 infections and acute COVID-19 severity was not correlated with gestational age at delivery (p=0·31). Interpretation: These results suggest that pregnant people would benefit from increased monitoring and enhanced prenatal care after first or second trimester SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of acute COVID-19 severity.

Various classification systems based on empirical observations have been proposed, but it is unclear to what extent they reflect ALS population substructures. We aimed to use machine-learning techniques to identify the number and nature of ALS subtypes to obtain a better understanding of this heterogeneity, enhance our understanding of the disease, and improve clinical care. Methods: In this retrospective study, we applied unsupervised Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection [UMAP]) modelling, semi-supervised (neural network UMAP) modelling, and supervised (ensemble learning based on LightGBM) modelling to a population-based discovery cohort of patients who were diagnosed with ALS while living in the Piedmont and Valle d'Aosta regions of Italy, for whom detailed clinical data, such as age at symptom onset, were available. We excluded patients with missing Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) feature values from the unsupervised and semi-supervised steps. We replicated our findings in an independent population-based cohort of patients who were diagnosed with ALS while living in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy. Findings: Between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2015, 2858 patients were entered in the discovery cohort. After excluding 497 (17%) patients with missing ALSFRS-R feature values, data for 42 clinical features across 2361 (83%) patients were available for the unsupervised and semi-supervised analysis. We found that semi-supervised machine learning produced the optimum clustering of the patients with ALS. These clusters roughly corresponded to the six clinical subtypes defined by the Chiò classification system (ie, bulbar, respiratory, flail arm, classical, pyramidal, and flail leg ALS). Between Jan 1, 2009, and March 1, 2018, 1097 patients were entered in the replication cohort. After excluding 108 (10%) patients with missing ALSFRS-R feature values, data for 42 clinical features across 989 patients were available for the unsupervised and semi-supervised analysis. All 1097 patients were included in the supervised analysis. The same clusters were identified in the replication cohort. By contrast, other ALS classification schemes, such as the El Escorial categories, Milano-Torino clinical staging, and King's clinical stages, did not adequately label the clusters. Supervised learning identified 11 clinical parameters that predicted ALS clinical subtypes with high accuracy (area under the curve 0·982 [95% CI 0·980–0·983]). Interpretation: Our data-driven study provides insight into the ALS population substructure and confirms that the Chiò classification system successfully identifies ALS subtypes. Additional validation is required to determine the accuracy and clinical use of these algorithms in assigning clinical subtypes. Nevertheless, our algorithms offer a broad insight into the clinical heterogeneity of ALS and help to determine the actual subtypes of disease that exist within this fatal neurodegenerative syndrome. The systematic identification of ALS subtypes will improve clinical care and clinical trial design.

Long COVID is characterised by evolving, heterogeneous symptoms, making it challenging to derive an unambiguous definition. Studies of electronic health records are a crucial element of the US National Institutes of Health's RECOVER Initiative, which is addressing the urgent need to understand long COVID, identify treatments, and accurately identify who has it—the latter is the aim of this study. Methods: Using the National COVID Cohort Collaborative's (N3C) electronic health record repository, we developed XGBoost machine learning models to identify potential patients with long COVID. We defined our base population (n=1 793 604) as any non-deceased adult patient (age ≥18 years) with either an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification COVID-19 diagnosis code (U07.1) from an inpatient or emergency visit, or a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test, and for whom at least 90 days have passed since COVID-19 index date. We examined demographics, health-care utilisation, diagnoses, and medications for 97 995 adults with COVID-19. We used data on these features and 597 patients from a long COVID clinic to train three machine learning models to identify potential long COVID among all patients with COVID-19, patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and patients who had COVID-19 but were not hospitalised. Feature importance was determined via Shapley values. We further validated the models on data from a fourth site. Findings: Our models identified, with high accuracy, patients who potentially have long COVID, achieving areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0·92 (all patients), 0·90 (hospitalised), and 0·85 (non-hospitalised). Important features, as defined by Shapley values, include rate of health-care utilisation, patient age, dyspnoea, and other diagnosis and medication information available within the electronic health record. Interpretation: Patients identified by our models as potentially having long COVID can be interpreted as patients warranting care at a specialty clinic for long COVID, which is an essential proxy for long COVID diagnosis as its definition continues to evolve. We also achieve the urgent goal of identifying potential long COVID in patients for clinical trials. As more data sources are identified, our models can be retrained and tuned based on the needs of individual studies.

Subtle changes in physiological parameters (such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and skin temperature), discernible by wearable devices, could act as early digital biomarkers of infections. Our primary objective was to assess the performance of statistical and algorithmic models using data from wearable devices to detect deviations compatible with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (known as CENTRAL), International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov on July 27, 2021 for publications, preprints, and study protocols describing the use of wearable devices to identify a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of 3196 records identified and screened, 12 articles and 12 study protocols were analysed. Most included articles had a moderate risk of bias, as per the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational and Cross-Sectional Studies. The accuracy of algorithmic models to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection varied greatly (area under the curve 0·52–0·92). An algorithm's ability to detect presymptomatic infection varied greatly (from 20% to 88% of cases), from 14 days to 1 day before symptom onset. Increased heart rate was most frequently associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with increased skin temperature and respiratory rate. All 12 protocols described prospective studies that had yet to be completed or to publish their results, including two randomised controlled trials. The evidence surrounding wearable devices in the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still in an early stage, with a limited overall number of studies identified. However, these studies show promise for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Large prospective, and preferably controlled, studies recruiting and retaining larger and more diverse populations are needed to provide further evidence. © 2022 The Author(s).

We present a novel deep-learning-based system, requiring no annotator but weak annotation from a diagnosis report, for accurate and generalisable performance in detecting multiple head disorders from CT scans, including ischaemia, haemorrhage, tumours, and skull fractures. Methods: Our system was developed on 104 597 head CT scans from the Chinese PLA General Hospital, with associated textual diagnosis reports. Without expert annotation, we used keyword matching on the reports to automatically generate disorder labels for each scan. The labels were inaccurate because of the unreliable annotator-free strategy and inexact because of scan-level annotation. We proposed RoLo, a novel weakly supervised learning algorithm, with a noise-tolerant mechanism and a multi-instance learning strategy to address these issues. RoLo was tested on retrospective (2357 scans from the Chinese PLA General Hospital), prospective (650 scans from the Chinese PLA General Hospital), cross-centre (1525 scans from the Brain Hospital of Hunan Province), cross-equipment (1484 scans from the Chinese PLA General Hospital), and cross-nation (CQ500 public dataset from India) test datasets. Four radiologists were tested on the prospective test dataset before and after viewing system recommendations to assess whether the system could improve diagnostic performance. Findings: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detecting the four disorder types was 0·976 (95% CI 0·976–0·976) for retrospective, 0·975 (0·974–0·976) for prospective, 0·965 (0·964–0·966) for cross-centre, and 0·971 (0·971–0·972) for cross-equipment test datasets, and 0·964 (0·964–0·966) for CQ500 (with only haemorrhage and fracture). The system achieved similar performance to four radiologists and helped to improve sensitivity and specificity by 0·109 (95% CI 0·086–0·131) and 0·022 (0·017–0·026), respectively. Interpretation: Without expert annotated data, our system achieved accurate and generalisable performance for head disorder detection. The system improved the diagnostic performance of radiologists. Because of its accuracy and generalisability, our computer-aided diganostic system could be used in clinical practice to improve the accuracy and efficiency of radiologists in different hospitals.

We aimed to show that telemedical monitoring with implantable cardiac monitors in these patients can improve early detection of subclinical but prognostically relevant arrhythmic events. Methods: We did a prospective investigator-initiated, randomised, multicentre, open-label, diagnostic trial at 33 centres in Germany and Austria. Survivors of acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular ejection fraction of 36–50% had biosignal analysis for assessment of cardiac autonomic function. Patients with abnormal periodic repolarisation dynamics (≥5·75 deg2) or abnormal deceleration capacity (≤2·5 ms) were randomly assigned (1:1) to telemedical monitoring with implantable cardiac monitors or conventional follow-up. Primary endpoint was time to detection of serious arrhythmic events defined by atrial fibrillation 6 min or longer, atrioventricular block class IIb or higher and fast non-sustained (>187 beats per min; ≥40 beats) or sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02594488. Findings: Between May 12, 2016, and July 20, 2020, 1305 individuals were screened and 400 patients at high risk were randomly assigned (median age 64 years [IQR 57–73]); left ventricular ejection fraction 45% [40–48]) to telemedical monitoring with implantable cardiac monitors (implantable cardiac monitor group; n=201) or conventional follow-up (control group; n=199). During median follow-up of 21 months, serious arrhythmic events were detected in 60 (30%) patients of the implantable cardiac monitor group and 12 (6%) patients of the control group (hazard ratio 6·33 [IQR 3·40–11·78]; p<0·001). An improved detection rate by implantable cardiac monitors was observed for all types of serious arrhythmic events: atrial fibrillation 6 min or longer (47 [23%] patients vs 11 [6%] patients; p<0·001), atrioventricular block class IIb or higher (14 [7%] vs 0; p<0·001) and ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (nine [4%] patients vs two [1%] patients; p=0·054). Interpretation: In patients at high risk after myocardial infarction and cardiac autonomic dysfunction but only moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, telemedical monitoring with implantable cardiac monitors was highly effective in early detection of subclinical, prognostically relevant serious arrhythmic events.

We aimed to analyse the utility of deep learning to preclassify histology of kidney allograft biopsies into three main broad categories (ie, normal, rejection, and other diseases) as a potential biopsy triage system focusing on transplant rejection. Methods: We performed a retrospective, multicentre, proof-of-concept study using 5844 digital whole slide images of kidney allograft biopsies from 1948 patients. Kidney allograft biopsy samples were identified by a database search in the Departments of Pathology of the Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands (1130 patients) and the University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands (717 patients). 101 consecutive kidney transplant biopsies were identified in the archive of the Institute of Pathology, RWTH Aachen University Hospital, Aachen, Germany. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained to classify allograft biopsies as normal, rejection, or other diseases. Three times cross-validation (1847 patients) and deployment on an external real-world cohort (101 patients) were used for validation. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used as the main performance metric (the primary endpoint to assess CNN performance). Findings: Serial CNNs, first classifying kidney allograft biopsies as normal (AUROC 0·87 [ten times bootstrapped CI 0·85–0·88]) and disease (0·87 [0·86–0·88]), followed by a second CNN classifying biopsies classified as disease into rejection (0·75 [0·73–0·76]) and other diseases (0·75 [0·72–0·77]), showed similar AUROC in cross-validation and deployment on independent real-world data (first CNN normal AUROC 0·83 [0·80–0·85], disease 0·83 [0·73–0·91]; second CNN rejection 0·61 [0·51–0·70], other diseases 0·61 [0·50–0·74]). A single CNN classifying biopsies as normal, rejection, or other diseases showed similar performance in cross-validation (normal AUROC 0·80 [0·73–0·84], rejection 0·76 [0·66–0·80], other diseases 0·50 [0·36–0·57]) and generalised well for normal and rejection classes in the real-world data. Visualisation techniques highlighted rejection-relevant areas of biopsies in the tubulointerstitium. Interpretation: This study showed that deep learning-based classification of transplant biopsies could support pathological diagnostics of kidney allograft rejection.

We compared safety and efficacy of the Cambridge hybrid closed-loop algorithm with usual care over 6 months in this population. Methods: In a multicentre, multinational, parallel randomised controlled trial, participants aged 6–18 years using insulin pump therapy were recruited at seven UK and five US paediatric diabetes centres. Key inclusion criteria were diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least 12 months, insulin pump therapy for at least 3 months, and screening HbA1c levels between 53 and 86 mmol/mol (7·0–10·0%). Using block randomisation and central randomisation software, we randomly assigned participants to either closed-loop insulin delivery (closed-loop group) or to usual care with insulin pump therapy (control group) for 6 months. Randomisation was stratified at each centre by local baseline HbA1c. The Cambridge closed-loop algorithm running on a smartphone was used with either (1) a modified Medtronic 640G pump, Medtronic Guardian 3 sensor, and Medtronic prototype phone enclosure (FlorenceM configuration), or (2) a Sooil Dana RS pump and Dexcom G6 sensor (CamAPS FX configuration). The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c at 6 months combining data from both configurations. The primary analysis was done in all randomised patients (intention to treat). Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02925299. Findings: Of 147 people initially screened, 133 participants (mean age 13·0 years [SD 2·8]; 57% female, 43% male) were randomly assigned to either the closed-loop group (n=65) or the control group (n=68). Mean baseline HbA1c was 8·2% (SD 0·7) in the closed-loop group and 8·3% (0·7) in the control group. At 6 months, HbA1c was lower in the closed-loop group than in the control group (between-group difference −3·5 mmol/mol (95% CI −6·5 to −0·5 [–0·32 percentage points, −0·59 to −0·04]; p=0·023). Closed-loop usage was low with FlorenceM due to failing phone enclosures (median 40% [IQR 26–53]), but consistently high with CamAPS FX (93% [88–96]), impacting efficacy. A total of 155 adverse events occurred after randomisation (67 in the closed-loop group, 88 in the control group), including seven severe hypoglycaemia events (four in the closed-loop group, three in the control group), two diabetic ketoacidosis events (both in the closed-loop group), and two non-treatment-related serious adverse events. There were 23 reportable hyperglycaemia events (11 in the closed-loop group, 12 in the control group), which did not meet criteria for diabetic ketoacidosis. Interpretation: The Cambridge hybrid closed-loop algorithm had an acceptable safety profile, and improved glycaemic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. To ensure optimal efficacy of the closed-loop system, usage needs to be consistently high, as demonstrated with CamAPS FX.

We aimed to establish the accuracy of an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm in predicting 1-year mortality and admission to hospital for heart failure after myocardial infarction. Methods: In this nationwide population-based study, we used data for all patients admitted to hospital for myocardial infarction and discharged alive from a coronary care unit in Sweden (n=139 288) between Jan 1, 2008, and April 1, 2017, from the Swedish Web system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART) nationwide registry; these patients were randomly divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets. We developed an ANN using 21 variables (including age, sex, medical history, previous medications, in-hospital characteristics, and discharge medications) associated with the outcomes of interest with a back-propagation algorithm in the training dataset and tested it in the testing dataset. The ANN algorithm was then validated in patients with incident myocardial infarction enrolled in the Western Denmark Heart Registry (external validation cohort) between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2016. The predictive ability of the model was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and Youden's index was established as a means of identifying an empirical dichotomous cutoff, allowing further evaluation of model performance. Findings: 139 288 patients who were admitted to hospital for myocardial infarction in the SWEDEHEART registry were randomly divided into a training dataset of 111 558 (80%) patients and a testing dataset of 27 730 (20%) patients. 30 971 patients with myocardial infarction who were enrolled in the Western Denmark Heart Registry were included in the external validation cohort. A first event, either all-cause mortality or admission to hospital for heart failure 1 year after myocardial infarction, occurred in 32 308 (23·2%) patients in the testing and training cohorts only. For 1-year all-cause mortality, the ANN had an AUROC of 0·85 (95% CI 0·84–0·85) in the testing dataset and 0·84 (0·83–0·84) in the external validation cohort. The AUROC for admission to hospital for heart failure within 1 year was 0·82 (0·81–0·82) in the testing dataset and 0·78 (0·77–0·79) in the external validation dataset. With an empirical cutoff the ANN algorithm correctly classified 73·6% of patients with regard to all-cause mortality and 61·5% of patients with regard to admission to hospital for heart failure in the external validation cohort, ruling out adverse outcomes with 97·1–98·7% probability in the external validation cohort. Interpretation: Identifying patients at a high risk of developing heart failure or death after myocardial infarction could result in tailored therapies and monitoring by the allocation of resources to those at greatest risk.

In this study, we aimed to examine the clinical and genetic associations of adult weight trajectories using electronic health records (EHRs) in the BioMe Biobank. Methods: We constructed four weight trajectories based on a-priori definitions of weight changes (5% or 10%) using annual weight in EHRs (stable weight, weight gain, weight loss, and weight cycle); the final weight dataset included 21 487 participants with 162 783 annual weight measures. To confirm accurate assignment of weight trajectories, we manually reviewed weight trajectory plots for 100 random individuals. We then did a hypothesis-free phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to identify diseases associated with each weight trajectory. Next, we estimated the single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability (hSNP2) of weight trajectories using GCTA-GREML, and we did a hypothesis-driven analysis of anorexia nervosa and depression polygenic risk scores (PRS) on these weight trajectories, given both diseases are associated with weight changes. We extended our analyses to the UK Biobank to replicate findings from a patient population to a generally healthy population. Findings: We found high concordance between manually assigned weight trajectories and those assigned by the algorithm (accuracy ≥98%). Stable weight was consistently associated with lower disease risks among those passing Bonferroni-corrected p value in our PheWAS (p≤4·4 × 10–5). Additionally, we identified an association between depression and weight cycle (odds ratio [OR] 1·42, 95% CI 1·31–1·55, p≤7·7 × 10–16). The adult weight trajectories were heritable (using 5% weight change as the cutoff: hSNP2 of 2·1%, 95% CI 0·9–3·3, for stable weight; 4·1%, 1·4–6·8, for weight gain; 5·5%, 2·8–8·2, for weight loss; and 4·7%, 2·3–7·1%, for weight cycle). Anorexia nervosa PRS was positively associated with weight loss trajectory among individuals without eating disorder diagnoses (OR1SD 1·16, 95% CI 1·07–1·26, per 1 SD higher PRS, p=0·011), and the association was not attenuated by obesity PRS. No association was found between depression PRS and weight trajectories after permutation tests. All main findings were replicated in the UK Biobank (p<0·05). Interpretation: Our findings suggest the importance of considering weight from a longitudinal aspect for its association with health and highlight a crucial role of weight management during disease development and progression.

We aimed to develop clinically relevant indicators of ACEs for linked EHRs of mothers and children using a multistage prediction model of child maltreatment and maternal intimate partner violence (IPV). Methods: In this multistage development and validation study, we developed a representative population-based birth cohort of mothers and children in England, followed from up to 2 years before birth to up to 5 years after birth across the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD (primary care), Hospital Episode Statistics (secondary care), and the Office for National Statistics mortality register. We included livebirths in England between July 1, 2004, and June 30, 2016, to mothers aged 16–55 years, who had registered with a general practitioner (GP) that met CPRD quality standards before 21 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome (reference standard) was any child maltreatment or maternal IPV in either the mother's or child's record from 2 years before birth (maternal IPV only) to 5 years after birth. We used seven prediction models, combined with expert ratings, to systematically develop indicators. We validated the final indicators by integrating results from machine learning models, survival analyses, and clustering analyses in the validation cohort. Findings: We included data collected between July 1, 2002, and June 27, 2018. Of 376 006 eligible births, we included 211 393 mother–child pairs (422 786 patients) from 400 practices, of whom 126 837 mother–child pairs (60·0%; 240 practices) were randomly assigned to a derivation cohort and 84 556 pairs (40·0%; 160 practices) to a validation cohort. We included 63 indicators in six ACE domains: maternal mental health problems, maternal substance misuse, adverse family environments, child maltreatment, maternal IPV, and high-risk presentations of child maltreatment. Excluding the seven indicators in the reference standard, 56 indicators showed high discriminative validity for the reference standard of any child maltreatment or maternal IPV between 2 years before and 5 years after birth (validation cohort, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0·85 [95% CI 0·84–0·86]). During the 2 years before birth and 5 years after birth, the overall period prevalence of maternal IPV and child maltreatment (reference standard) was 2·3% (2876 of 126 837 pairs) in the derivation cohort and 2·3% (1916 of 84 556 pairs) in the validation cohort. During the 2 years before and after birth, the period prevalence was 39·1% (95% CI 38·7–39·5; 34 773 pairs) for any of the 63 ACE indicators, 22·2% (21·8–22·5%; 20 122 pairs) for maternal mental health problems, 15·7% (15·4–16·0%; 14 549 pairs) for adverse family environments, 8·1% (7·8–8·3%; 6808 pairs) for high-risk presentations of child maltreatment, 6·9% (6·7–7·2%; 7856 pairs) for maternal substance misuse, and 3·0% (2·9–3·2%; 2540 pairs) for any child maltreatment (2·4% [2·3–5·6%; 2051 pairs]) and maternal IPV (1·0% [0·8–1·0%; 875 pairs]). 62·6% (21 785 of 34 773 pairs) of ACEs were recorded in primary care only, and 72·3% (25 140 cases) were recorded in the maternal record only. Interpretation: We developed clinically relevant indicators for identifying ACEs using the EHRs of mothers and children presenting to general practices and hospital admissions. Over 70% of ACEs were identified via maternal records and were recorded in primary care by GPs within 2 years of birth, reinforcing the importance of reviewing parental and carer records to inform clinical responses to children. ACE indicators can contribute to longitudinal surveillance informing public health policy and resource allocation. Further evaluation is required to determine how ACE indicators can be used in clinical practice. Funding: None. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To identify and characterise disease trajectories, we aimed to define and validate ten COVID-19 phenotypes from nationwide linked electronic health records (EHR) using an extensible framework. Methods: In this cohort study, we used eight linked National Health Service (NHS) datasets for people in England alive on Jan 23, 2020. Data on COVID-19 testing, vaccination, primary and secondary care records, and death registrations were collected until Nov 30, 2021. We defined ten COVID-19 phenotypes reflecting clinically relevant stages of disease severity and encompassing five categories: positive SARS-CoV-2 test, primary care diagnosis, hospital admission, ventilation modality (four phenotypes), and death (three phenotypes). We constructed patient trajectories illustrating transition frequency and duration between phenotypes. Analyses were stratified by pandemic waves and vaccination status. Findings: Among 57 032 174 individuals included in the cohort, 13 990 423 COVID-19 events were identified in 7 244 925 individuals, equating to an infection rate of 12·7% during the study period. Of 7 244 925 individuals, 460 737 (6·4%) were admitted to hospital and 158 020 (2·2%) died. Of 460 737 individuals who were admitted to hospital, 48 847 (10·6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 69 090 (15·0%) received non-invasive ventilation, and 25 928 (5·6%) received invasive ventilation. Among 384 135 patients who were admitted to hospital but did not require ventilation, mortality was higher in wave 1 (23 485 [30·4%] of 77 202 patients) than wave 2 (44 220 [23·1%] of 191 528 patients), but remained unchanged for patients admitted to the ICU. Mortality was highest among patients who received ventilatory support outside of the ICU in wave 1 (2569 [50·7%] of 5063 patients). 15 486 (9·8%) of 158 020 COVID-19-related deaths occurred within 28 days of the first COVID-19 event without a COVID-19 diagnoses on the death certificate. 10 884 (6·9%) of 158 020 deaths were identified exclusively from mortality data with no previous COVID-19 phenotype recorded. We observed longer patient trajectories in wave 2 than wave 1. Interpretation: Our analyses illustrate the wide spectrum of disease trajectories as shown by differences in incidence, survival, and clinical pathways. We have provided a modular analytical framework that can be used to monitor the impact of the pandemic and generate evidence of clinical and policy relevance using multiple EHR sources.

However, specific qualities of artificial intelligence systems, such as the tendency to learn spurious correlates in training data, poor generalisability to new deployment settings, and a paucity of reliable explainability mechanisms, mean they can yield unpredictable errors that might be entirely missed without proactive investigation. We propose a medical algorithmic audit framework that guides the auditor through a process of considering potential algorithmic errors in the context of a clinical task, mapping the components that might contribute to the occurrence of errors, and anticipating their potential consequences. We suggest several approaches for testing algorithmic errors, including exploratory error analysis, subgroup testing, and adversarial testing, and provide examples from our own work and previous studies. The medical algorithmic audit is a tool that can be used to better understand the weaknesses of an artificial intelligence system and put in place mechanisms to mitigate their impact. We propose that safety monitoring and medical algorithmic auditing should be a joint responsibility between users and developers, and encourage the use of feedback mechanisms between these groups to promote learning and maintain safe deployment of artificial intelligence systems. © 2022 The Author(s).

The prognosis and disease burden are highly dependent on the cancer type and disease stage at diagnosis. We systematically reviewed studies on artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms that aim to facilitate the early diagnosis of skin cancers, focusing on their application in primary and community care settings. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science (from Jan 1, 2000, to Aug 9, 2021) for all studies providing evidence on applying AI/ML algorithms to the early diagnosis of skin cancer, including all study designs and languages. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy of the algorithms for skin cancers. The secondary outcomes included an overview of AI/ML methods, evaluation approaches, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability to patients and clinicians. We identified 14 224 studies. Only two studies used data from clinical settings with a low prevalence of skin cancers. We reported data from all 272 studies that could be relevant in primary care. The primary outcomes showed reasonable mean diagnostic accuracy for melanoma (89·5% [range 59·7–100%]), squamous cell carcinoma (85·3% [71·0–97·8%]), and basal cell carcinoma (87·6% [70·0–99·7%]). The secondary outcomes showed a heterogeneity of AI/ML methods and study designs, with high amounts of incomplete reporting (eg, patient demographics and methods of data collection). Few studies used data on populations with a low prevalence of skin cancers to train and test their algorithms; therefore, the widespread adoption into community and primary care practice cannot currently be recommended until efficacy in these populations is shown. We did not identify any health economic, patient, or clinician acceptability data for any of the included studies. We propose a methodological checklist for use in the development of new AI/ML algorithms to detect skin cancer, to facilitate their design, evaluation, and implementation. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, the typical turnaround time for laboratory PCR remains 12–24 h and lateral flow devices (LFDs) have limited sensitivity. Previously, we have shown that artificial intelligence-driven triage (CURIAL-1.0) can provide rapid COVID-19 screening using clinical data routinely available within 1 h of arrival to hospital. Here, we aimed to improve the time from arrival to the emergency department to the availability of a result, do external and prospective validation, and deploy a novel laboratory-free screening tool in a UK emergency department. Methods: We optimised our previous model, removing less informative predictors to improve generalisability and speed, developing the CURIAL-Lab model with vital signs and readily available blood tests (full blood count [FBC]; urea, creatinine, and electrolytes; liver function tests; and C-reactive protein) and the CURIAL-Rapide model with vital signs and FBC alone. Models were validated externally for emergency admissions to University Hospitals Birmingham, Bedfordshire Hospitals, and Portsmouth Hospitals University National Health Service (NHS) trusts, and prospectively at Oxford University Hospitals, by comparison with PCR testing. Next, we compared model performance directly against LFDs and evaluated a combined pathway that triaged patients who had either a positive CURIAL model result or a positive LFD to a COVID-19-suspected clinical area. Lastly, we deployed CURIAL-Rapide alongside an approved point-of-care FBC analyser to provide laboratory-free COVID-19 screening at the John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford, UK). Our primary improvement outcome was time-to-result, and our performance measures were sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Findings: 72 223 patients met eligibility criteria across the four validating hospital groups, in a total validation period spanning Dec 1, 2019, to March 31, 2021. CURIAL-Lab and CURIAL-Rapide performed consistently across trusts (AUROC range 0·858–0·881, 95% CI 0·838–0·912, for CURIAL-Lab and 0·836–0·854, 0·814–0·889, for CURIAL-Rapide), achieving highest sensitivity at Portsmouth Hospitals (84·1%, Wilson's 95% CI 82·5–85·7, for CURIAL-Lab and 83·5%, 81·8–85·1, for CURIAL-Rapide) at specificities of 71·3% (70·9–71·8) for CURIAL-Lab and 63·6% (63·1–64·1) for CURIAL-Rapide. When combined with LFDs, model predictions improved triage sensitivity from 56·9% (51·7–62·0) for LFDs alone to 85·6% with CURIAL-Lab (81·6–88·9; AUROC 0·925) and 88·2% with CURIAL-Rapide (84·4–91·1; AUROC 0·919), thereby reducing missed COVID-19 cases by 65% with CURIAL-Lab and 72% with CURIAL-Rapide. For the prospective deployment of CURIAL-Rapide, 520 patients were enrolled for point-of-care FBC analysis between Feb 18 and May 10, 2021, of whom 436 received confirmatory PCR testing and ten (2·3%) tested positive. Median time from arrival to a CURIAL-Rapide result was 45 min (IQR 32–64), 16 min (26·3%) sooner than with LFDs (61 min, 37–99; log-rank p<0·0001), and 6 h 52 min (90·2%) sooner than with PCR (7 h 37 min, 6 h 5 min to 15 h 39 min; p<0·0001). Classification performance was high, with sensitivity of 87·5% (95% CI 52·9–97·8), specificity of 85·4% (81·3–88·7), and negative predictive value of 99·7% (98·2–99·9). CURIAL-Rapide correctly excluded infection for 31 (58·5%) of 53 patients who were triaged by a physician to a COVID-19-suspected area but went on to test negative by PCR. Interpretation: Our findings show the generalisability, performance, and real-world operational benefits of artificial intelligence-driven screening for COVID-19 over standard-of-care in emergency departments. CURIAL-Rapide provided rapid, laboratory-free screening when used with near-patient FBC analysis, and was able to reduce the number of patients who tested negative for COVID-19 but were triaged to COVID-19-suspected areas.

Following a qualitative phase to identify signs, symptoms, and risk factors, we aimed to develop and validate two COVID-19-specific risk prediction scores. Remote COVID-19 Assessment in Primary Care-General Practice score (RECAP-GP; without peripheral oxygen saturation [SpO2]) and RECAP-oxygen saturation score (RECAP-O2; with SpO2). Methods: RECAP was a prospective cohort study that used multivariable logistic regression. Data on signs and symptoms (predictors) of disease were collected from community-based patients with suspected COVID-19 via primary care electronic health records and linked with secondary data on hospital admission (outcome) within 28 days of symptom onset. Data sources for RECAP-GP were Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre (RCGP-RSC) primary care practices (development set), northwest London primary care practices (validation set), and the NHS COVID-19 Clinical Assessment Service (CCAS; validation set). The data source for RECAP-O2 was the Doctaly Assist platform (development set and validation set in subsequent sample). The two probabilistic risk prediction models were built by backwards elimination using the development sets and validated by application to the validation datasets. Estimated sample size per model, including the development and validation sets was 2880 people. Findings: Data were available from 8311 individuals. Observations, such as SpO2, were mostly missing in the northwest London, RCGP-RSC, and CCAS data; however, SpO2 was available for 1364 (70·0%) of 1948 patients who used Doctaly. In the final predictive models, RECAP-GP (n=1863) included sex (male and female), age (years), degree of breathlessness (three point scale), temperature symptoms (two point scale), and presence of hypertension (yes or no); the area under the curve was 0·80 (95% CI 0·76–0·85) and on validation the negative predictive value of a low risk designation was 99% (95% CI 98·1–99·2; 1435 of 1453). RECAP-O2 included age (years), degree of breathlessness (two point scale), fatigue (two point scale), and SpO2 at rest (as a percentage); the area under the curve was 0·84 (0·78–0·90) and on validation the negative predictive value of low risk designation was 99% (95% CI 98·9–99·7; 1176 of 1183). Interpretation: Both RECAP models are valid tools to assess COVID-19 patients in the community. RECAP-GP can be used initially, without need for observations, to identify patients who require monitoring. If the patient is monitored and SpO2 is available, RECAP-O2 is useful to assess the need for treatment escalation.

In this systematic review, we aim to assess the effectiveness and safety of pulse oximetry in remote patient monitoring (RPM) of patients at home with COVID-19. We searched five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, medRxiv, and bioRxiv) from database inception to April 15, 2021, and included feasibility studies, clinical trials, and observational studies, including preprints. We found 561 studies, of which 13 were included in our narrative synthesis. These 13 studies were all observational cohorts and involved a total of 2908 participants. A meta-analysis was not feasible owing to the heterogeneity of the outcomes reported in the included studies. Our systematic review substantiates the safety and potential of pulse oximetry for monitoring patients at home with COVID-19, identifying the risk of deterioration and the need for advanced care. The use of pulse oximetry can potentially save hospital resources for patients who might benefit the most from care escalation; however, we could not identify explicit evidence for the effect of RPM with pulse oximetry on health outcomes compared with other monitoring models such as virtual wards, regular monitoring consultations, and online or paper diaries to monitor changes in symptoms and vital signs. Based on our findings, we make 11 recommendations across the three Donabedian model domains and highlight three specific measurements for setting up an RPM system with pulse oximetry. © 2022 The Author(s).

Current non-invasive tests to detect advanced liver fibrosis have limited performance, with many indeterminate classifications. We aimed to identify patients with advanced liver fibrosis of all-causes using machine learning algorithms (MLAs). Methods: In this retrospective study of routinely collected laboratory, clinical, and demographic data, we trained six MLAs (support vector machine, random forest classifier, gradient boosting classifier, logistic regression, artificial neural network, and an ensemble of all these algorithms) to detect advanced fibrosis using 1703 liver biopsies from patients seen at the Toronto Liver Clinic (TLC) between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 20, 2014. Performance was validated using five datasets derived from patient data provided by the TLC (n=104 patients with a biopsy sample taken between March 24, 2014, and Dec 31, 2017) and McGill University Health Centre (MUHC; n=404). Patients with decompensated cirrhosis were excluded. Performance was benchmarked against aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS), transient elastography, and an independent panel of five hepatology experts (MB, GS, HK, KP, and RSK). MLA performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the percentage of determinate classifications. Findings: The best MLA was an ensemble algorithm of support vector machine, random forest classifier, gradient boosting classifier, logistic regression, and neural network algorithms, which achieved 100% determinate classifications (95% CI 100·0–100·0), an AUROC score of 0·870 (95% CI 0·797–0·931) on the TLC validation set (fibrosis stages F0 and F1 vs F4), and an AUROC of 0·716 (95% CI 0·664–0·766) on the MUHC validation set (fibrosis stages F0, F1, and F2 vs F3 and F4). The ensemble MLA outperformed all routinely used biomarkers and achieved comparable performance to hepatologists as measured by AUROC and percentage of indeterminate classifications in both the TLC validation dataset (APRI AUROC score 0·719 [95% CI 0·611–0·820], 83·7% determinate [95% CI 76·0–90·4]; FIB-4 AUROC score 0·825 [95% CI 0·730–0·912], 72·1% determinate [95% CI 63·5–80·8]) and the MUHC validation dataset (APRI AUROC score 0·618 [95% CI 0·548–0·691], 75·5% determinate [95% CI 71·5–79·2]; FIB-4 AUROC score 0·717 (95% CI 0·652–0·776), 75·5% determinate [95% CI 0·713–0·797]), and achieving only slightly lower AUROC than transient elastography (0·773 [95% CI 0·699–0·834] vs 0·826 [95% CI 0·758–0·889]). Interpretation: We have shown that an ensemble MLA outperforms non-imaging-based methods in detecting advanced fibrosis across different causes of liver disease. Our MLA was superior to APRI, FIB-4, and NFS with no indeterminate classifications, while achieving performance comparable to an independent panel of experts. MLAs using routinely collected data could identify patients at high-risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis among patients with chronic liver disease, allowing intervention before onset of decompensation.

We aimed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of AI to recognise a patient's racial identity from medical images. Methods: Using private (Emory CXR, Emory Chest CT, Emory Cervical Spine, and Emory Mammogram) and public (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, National Lung Cancer Screening Trial, RSNA Pulmonary Embolism CT, and Digital Hand Atlas) datasets, we evaluated, first, performance quantification of deep learning models in detecting race from medical images, including the ability of these models to generalise to external environments and across multiple imaging modalities. Second, we assessed possible confounding of anatomic and phenotypic population features by assessing the ability of these hypothesised confounders to detect race in isolation using regression models, and by re-evaluating the deep learning models by testing them on datasets stratified by these hypothesised confounding variables. Last, by exploring the effect of image corruptions on model performance, we investigated the underlying mechanism by which AI models can recognise race. Findings: In our study, we show that standard AI deep learning models can be trained to predict race from medical images with high performance across multiple imaging modalities, which was sustained under external validation conditions (x-ray imaging [area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) range 0·91–0·99], CT chest imaging [0·87–0·96], and mammography [0·81]). We also showed that this detection is not due to proxies or imaging-related surrogate covariates for race (eg, performance of possible confounders: body-mass index [AUC 0·55], disease distribution [0·61], and breast density [0·61]). Finally, we provide evidence to show that the ability of AI deep learning models persisted over all anatomical regions and frequency spectrums of the images, suggesting the efforts to control this behaviour when it is undesirable will be challenging and demand further study. Interpretation: The results from our study emphasise that the ability of AI deep learning models to predict self-reported race is itself not the issue of importance. However, our finding that AI can accurately predict self-reported race, even from corrupted, cropped, and noised medical images, often when clinical experts cannot, creates an enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging.

However, there are many barriers to implementing AI, including patient acceptance and understanding of AI. Patients’ attitudes toward AI are not well understood. We systematically reviewed the literature on patient and general public attitudes toward clinical AI (either hypothetical or realised), including quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods original research articles. We searched biomedical and computational databases from Jan 1, 2000, to Sept 28, 2020, and screened 2590 articles, 23 of which met our inclusion criteria. Studies were heterogeneous regarding the study population, study design, and the field and type of AI under study. Six (26%) studies assessed currently available or soon-to-be available AI tools, whereas 17 (74%) assessed hypothetical or broadly defined AI. The quality of the methods of these studies was mixed, with a frequent issue of selection bias. Overall, patients and the general public conveyed positive attitudes toward AI but had many reservations and preferred human supervision. We summarise our findings in six themes: AI concept, AI acceptability, AI relationship with humans, AI development and implementation, AI strengths and benefits, and AI weaknesses and risks. We suggest guidance for future studies, with the goal of supporting the safe, equitable, and patient-centred implementation of clinical AI. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness in increasing service utilisation of the Peek Community Eye Health (Peek CEH) system, a smartphone-based referral system comprising decision support algorithms (Peek Community Screening app), SMS reminders, and real-time reporting. Methods: In this cluster-randomised controlled trial of eye health in Kenya, community unit clusters were defined as one health centre and its catchment population. Clusters were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive Peek CEH and referral (intervention group) or standard care via periodic health centre-based outreach clinics and onward referral (control group). Individuals in the intervention group were assessed at home by screeners and those referred were asked to present for triage assessment in a central location. They received regular SMS reminders. In both groups, community sensitisation was done followed by a triage clinic at the cluster health centre 4 weeks after sensitisation. During triage, individuals in both groups were assessed and treated and, if necessary, referred to a specific hospital. Individuals in the intervention group received further SMS reminders. The primary outcome was the mean attendance rate (the number of people per 10 000 population) at triage of those with confirmed eye conditions, as assessed at 4 weeks after sensitisation in the intention-to-treat population. We estimated the intervention effect using a Student's t-test on cluster-level rates. This trial is registered with Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, number 201807329096632. Findings: Between Nov 26, 2018, and June 7, 2019, of the 85 community units in Trans Nzoia County, Kenya, 49 were excluded. We randomly allocated 18 community units each to the intervention group (68 348 individuals) and the control group (60 243 individuals). 9387 individuals from the intervention group and 3070 from the control group attended triage assessment. The mean attendance rate at triage by individuals with eye problems was 1429 (92% CI 1228–1629) in the intervention group and 522 (418–625) in the control group (rate difference 906 per 10 000 [95% CI 689–1124; p<0·0001]). Interpretation: The Peek CEH system increased primary care attendance by people with eye problems compared with standard approaches, indicating the potential of this mobile health package to increase service uptake and guide appropriate task sharing.

We assessed the association between location-specific community mobility and the reproduction number (R) of SARS-CoV-2 across UK local authorities. Methods: In this modelling study, we linked data on community mobility from Google with data on R from 330 UK local authorities, for the period June 1, 2020, to Feb 13, 2021. Six mobility metrics are available in the Google community mobility dataset: visits to retail and recreation places, visits to grocery and pharmacy stores, visits to transit stations, visits to parks, visits to workplaces, and length of stay in residential places. For each local authority, we modelled the weekly change in R (the R ratio) per a rescaled weekly percentage change in each location-specific mobility metric relative to a pre-pandemic baseline period (Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020), with results synthesised across local authorities using a random-effects meta-analysis. Findings: On a weekly basis, increased visits to retail and recreation places were associated with a substantial increase in R (R ratio 1·053 [99·2% CI 1·041–1·065] per 15% weekly increase compared with baseline visits) as were increased visits to workplaces (R ratio 1·060 [1·046–1·074] per 10% increase compared with baseline visits). By comparison, increased visits to grocery and pharmacy stores were associated with a small but still statistically significant increase in R (R ratio 1·011 [1·005–1·017] per 5% weekly increase compared with baseline visits). Increased visits to parks were associated with a decreased R (R ratio 0·972 [0·965–0·980]), as were longer stays at residential areas (R ratio 0·952 [0·928–0·976]). Increased visits to transit stations were not associated with R nationally, but were associated with a substantial increase in R in cities. An increasing trend was observed for the first 6 weeks of 2021 in the effect of visits to retail and recreation places and workplaces on R. Interpretation: Increased visits to retail and recreation places, workplaces, and transit stations in cities are important drivers of increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission; the increasing trend in the effects of these drivers in the first 6 weeks of 2021 was possibly associated with the emerging alpha (B.1.1.7) variant. These findings provide important evidence for the management of current and future mobility restrictions. Funding: Wellcome Trust and Data-Driven Innovation initiative. © 2021 The Author(s).

We developed a deep-learning AI model (ThyNet) to differentiate between malignant tumours and benign thyroid nodules and aimed to investigate how ThyNet could help radiologists improve diagnostic performance and avoid unnecessary fine needle aspiration. Methods: ThyNet was developed and trained on 18 049 images of 8339 patients (training set) from two hospitals (the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, and Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China) and tested on 4305 images of 2775 patients (total test set) from seven hospitals (the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China; the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; the Guangzhou Army General Hospital, Guangzhou, China; the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; and the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China) in three stages. All nodules in the training and total test set were pathologically confirmed. The diagnostic performance of ThyNet was first compared with 12 radiologists (test set A); a ThyNet-assisted strategy, in which ThyNet assisted diagnoses made by radiologists, was developed to improve diagnostic performance of radiologists using images (test set B); the ThyNet assisted strategy was then tested in a real-world clinical setting (using images and videos; test set C). In a simulated scenario, the number of unnecessary fine needle aspirations avoided by ThyNet-assisted strategy was calculated. Findings: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for accurate diagnosis of ThyNet (0·922 [95% CI 0·910–0·934]) was significantly higher than that of the radiologists (0·839 [0·834–0·844]; p<0·0001). Furthermore, ThyNet-assisted strategy improved the pooled AUROC of the radiologists from 0·837 (0·832–0·842) when diagnosing without ThyNet to 0·875 (0·871–0·880; p<0·0001) with ThyNet for reviewing images, and from 0·862 (0·851–0·872) to 0·873 (0·863–0·883; p<0·0001) in the clinical test, which used images and videos. In the simulated scenario, the number of fine needle aspirations decreased from 61·9% to 35·2% using the ThyNet-assisted strategy, while missed malignancy decreased from 18·9% to 17·0%. Interpretation: The ThyNet-assisted strategy can significantly improve the diagnostic performance of radiologists and help reduce unnecessary fine needle aspirations for thyroid nodules.

We therefore aimed to describe and compare key wearable signals (ie, heart rate, step count, and home blood pressure measurements) across age, sex, race, ethnicity, and clinical phenotypes. Methods: In the Michigan Predictive Activity & Clinical Trajectories in Health (MIPACT) prospective observational study, we enrolled participants from Michigan Medicine, Ann Abor, MI, USA, and followed them up for at least 90 days. Patients were included if they were aged 18 years or older, were fluent in English, owned an iPhone 6 or newer model with a supported iOS version, and had regular access to the internet throughout the study period. All participants were provided with an Apple Watch Series 3 or 4, an Omron Evolv Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor, and the MyDataHelps study smartphone application. Participants were asked to wear their watch for 12 h per day or longer and to do daily or weekly tasks, including home blood pressure measurements and breathing tasks. Heart rate, blood pressure, step counts, and distance walked were collected. The study was divided into two phases: an intensive 45-day collection phase (phase 1); and a 3-year longitudinal monitoring phase (phase 2). Here we report the first 90 days of data for all participants, which includes all of phase 1 and the first 45 days of phase 2. Participants’ electronic health records were used to establish clinical diagnoses for analysis. Findings: We enrolled 6765 eligible participants between Aug 14, 2018, and Dec 19, 2019, of whom 6454 participants from Michigan Medicine completed the phase 1 study protocol and were included in this analysis (3482 [54%] women and 2972 [46%] men; 3657 [57%] participants were White, with 1094 [17%] Asian and 1090 [17%] Black participants). On days when participants wore their smart watches, median daily watch wear time was 15·5 h (IQR 14–17). Participants contributed a total of 1 107 320 blood pressure and 202 198 347 heart rate measurements over 90 days, with 172 (SD 50) blood pressure and 31 329 (SD 24 620) heart rate measurements per participant. Mean systolic blood pressure was 122 mm Hg (SD 10) and mean diastolic blood pressure was 77 mm Hg (SD 8), with 167 312 (15%) measurements having a systolic blood pressure higher than 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mm Hg. Mean resting heart rate was 64 beats per min (SD 8). Blood pressure and resting heart rate varied by sex, age, race, and ethnicity, with higher blood pressures in males and lower heart rate in participants aged 65 years or older (p<0·0001). Participants took 7511 steps per day (SD 2805) and walked 6009 metres per day (SD 2608), varying across demographic and clinical subgroups. Interpretation: These data could inform clinical trial design, interpretation of wearable data in clinical practice, and health-care interventions.

We aimed to create a national dataset of patient-level data in Scotland to identify temporal trends and COVID-19 risk factors, and to develop a novel statistical prediction model to forecast COVID-19-related deaths and hospitalisations during the second wave. Methods: We established a surveillance platform to monitor COVID-19 temporal trends using person-level primary care data (including age, sex, socioeconomic status, urban or rural residence, care home residence, and clinical risk factors) linked to data on SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests, hospitalisations, and deaths for all individuals resident in Scotland who were registered with a general practice on Feb 23, 2020. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association between clinical risk groups and time to hospitalisation and death. A survival prediction model derived from data from March 1 to June 23, 2020, was created to forecast hospital admissions and deaths from October to December, 2020. We fitted a generalised additive spline model to daily SARS-CoV-2 cases over the previous 10 weeks and used this to create a 28-day forecast of the number of daily cases. The age and risk group pattern of cases in the previous 3 weeks was then used to select a stratified sample of individuals from our cohort who had not previously tested positive, with future cases in each group sampled from a multinomial distribution. We then used their patient characteristics (including age, sex, comorbidities, and socioeconomic status) to predict their probability of hospitalisation or death. Findings: Our cohort included 5 384 819 people, representing 98·6% of the entire estimated population residing in Scotland during 2020. Hospitalisation and death among those testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1 and June 23, 2020, were associated with several patient characteristics, including male sex (hospitalisation hazard ratio [HR] 1·47, 95% CI 1·38–1·57; death HR 1·62, 1·49–1·76) and various comorbidities, with the highest hospitalisation HR found for transplantation (4·53, 1·87–10·98) and the highest death HR for myoneural disease (2·33, 1·46–3·71). For those testing positive, there were decreasing temporal trends in hospitalisation and death rates. The proportion of positive tests among older age groups (>40 years) and those with at-risk comorbidities increased during October, 2020. On Nov 10, 2020, the projected number of hospitalisations for Dec 8, 2020 (28 days later) was 90 per day (95% prediction interval 55–125) and the projected number of deaths was 21 per day (12–29). Interpretation: The estimated incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on positive tests recorded in this unique data resource has provided forecasts of hospitalisation and death rates for the whole of Scotland. These findings were used by the Scottish Government to inform their response to reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality.

However, differential diagnosis between bacterial and viral causes is challenging and misdiagnosis can result in antimicrobial overuse and hinder prompt treatment. We aimed to build and validate a diagnostic model to discriminate bacterial from viral infection in acute febrile illness by evaluating the expression of potential classifier host genes. Methods: In this multicentre discovery and validation study, we included patients aged 14–85 years with acute febrile illness (fever for ≤14 days, axillary temperature of ≥38°C, and confirmed bacterial infection, viral infection, or non-infectious inflammatory disease), and healthy control participants (no significant medical history and no fever within the past 90 days) from four hospitals in Shandong province, China. Patients from the first hospital were divided into the screening, discovery, and internal validation groups, and patients from the three other hospitals comprised the external validation group. We measured expression of candidate genes in peripheral blood by RT-PCR, and patients for whom a successful RT-PCT result was recorded were included in the next-step analysis. For patients from the first hospital, those enrolled during the early phase of the study were assigned to the screening group, which was used to identify the optimal transcripts (IFI44L and PI3) for discrimination between bacterial and viral infections by screening four candidate genes (FAM89A, IFI44L, PI3, and ITGB2) by RT-PCR. The remaining patients were then randomly assigned (1:1) to discovery and internal validation groups by time of admission and blood drawing via the equidistant random sampling method. A logistic regression model integrating the mRNA levels of IFI44L and PI3 was built by use of the discovery group, and the diagnostic performance of the model was evaluated in the internal and external validation groups using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Findings: Between March 1, 2018, and Aug 31, 2019, we assessed 1658 individuals for inclusion in the study. After exclusion of ineligible participants, 458 participants were enrolled (178 patients with acute febrile illness caused by bacterial infection, 212 with acute febrile illness caused by viral infection, 38 with non-infectious inflammatory diseases, and 30 healthy controls). The 390 patients with bacterial or viral infections were assigned to one of four groups: screening (n=64, 33 with bacterial infections and 31 with viral infections), discovery (n=124, 55 with bacterial infections and 69 with viral infections), internal validation (n=124, 55 with bacterial infections and 69 with viral infections), and external validation (n=78, 35 with bacterial infections and 43 with viral infections). Of the four candidate host genes (FAM89A, IFI44L, PI3, and ITGB2), IFI44L and PI3 showed the most discriminative expression pattern and were used to build the logistic regression model. We established the optimal cutoff of the bacterial infection likelihood score to be 0·547598. With the diagnostic result from the gold standard tests (culture and PCR) as the reference, the two-transcript classifier model had an AUC of 0·969 (95% CI 0·937–1·000), sensitivity of 0·891 (0·782–0·949), and specificity of 0·971 (0·900–0·992) to discriminate bacterial and viral infections in the internal validation group. The model showed similar results in the external validation group (AUC 0·986, 95% CI 0·968–1·000; sensitivity 0·857, 0·706–0·937; and specificity 0·954, 0·845–0·987). Interpretation: IFI44L and PI3 transcripts, measured by RT-PCR, are robust classifiers to discriminate bacterial from viral infection in acute febrile illness. This two-transcript biomarker has the potential to be transformed into a commercial panel and applied universally. Funding: None. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to examine the longitudinal associations between population mobility and COVID-19 incidence at the subcity level across a large number of Latin American cities. Methods: In this longitudinal ecological study, we compiled aggregated mobile phone location data, daily confirmed COVID-19 cases, and features of urban and social environments to analyse population mobility and COVID-19 incidence at the subcity level among cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, and Mexico, from March 2 to Aug 29, 2020. Spatially aggregated mobile phone data were provided by the UN Development Programme in Latin America and the Caribbean and Grandata; confirmed COVID-19 cases were from national government reports and population and socioeconomic factors were from the latest national census in each country. We used mixed-effects negative binomial regression for a time-series analysis, to examine longitudinal associations between weekly mobility changes from baseline (prepandemic week of March 2–9, 2020) and subsequent COVID-19 incidence (lagged by 1–6 weeks) at the subcity level, adjusting for urban environmental and socioeconomic factors (time-invariant educational attainment, residential overcrowding, population density [all at the subcity level], and country). Findings: We included 1031 subcity areas, representing 314 Latin American cities, in Argentina (107 subcity areas), Brazil (416), Colombia (82), Guatemala (20), and Mexico (406). In the main adjusted model, we observed an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 2·35 (95% CI 2·12–2·60) for COVID-19 incidence per log unit increase in the mobility ratio (vs baseline) during the previous week. Thus, 10% lower weekly mobility was associated with 8·6% (95% CI 7·6–9·6) lower incidence of COVID-19 in the following week. This association gradually weakened as the lag between mobility and COVID-19 incidence increased and was not different from null at a 6-week lag. Interpretation: Reduced population movement within a subcity area is associated with a subsequent decrease in COVID-19 incidence among residents of that subcity area. Policies that reduce population mobility at the subcity level might be an effective COVID-19 mitigation strategy, although they should be combined with strategies that mitigate any adverse social and economic consequences of reduced mobility for the most vulnerable groups.

The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of invasive disease due to these pathogens during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this prospective analysis of surveillance data, laboratories in 26 countries and territories across six continents submitted data on cases of invasive disease due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis from Jan 1, 2018, to May, 31, 2020, as part of the Invasive Respiratory Infection Surveillance (IRIS) Initiative. Numbers of weekly cases in 2020 were compared with corresponding data for 2018 and 2019. Data for invasive disease due to Streptococcus agalactiae, a non-respiratory pathogen, were collected from nine laboratories for comparison. The stringency of COVID-19 containment measures was quantified using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Changes in population movements were assessed using Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. Interrupted time-series modelling quantified changes in the incidence of invasive disease due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis in 2020 relative to when containment measures were imposed. Findings: 27 laboratories from 26 countries and territories submitted data to the IRIS Initiative for S pneumoniae (62 837 total cases), 24 laboratories from 24 countries submitted data for H influenzae (7796 total cases), and 21 laboratories from 21 countries submitted data for N meningitidis (5877 total cases). All countries and territories had experienced a significant and sustained reduction in invasive diseases due to S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis in early 2020 (Jan 1 to May 31, 2020), coinciding with the introduction of COVID-19 containment measures in each country. By contrast, no significant changes in the incidence of invasive S agalactiae infections were observed. Similar trends were observed across most countries and territories despite differing stringency in COVID-19 control policies. The incidence of reported S pneumoniae infections decreased by 68% at 4 weeks (incidence rate ratio 0·32 [95% CI 0·27–0·37]) and 82% at 8 weeks (0·18 [0·14–0·23]) following the week in which significant changes in population movements were recorded. Interpretation: The introduction of COVID-19 containment policies and public information campaigns likely reduced transmission of S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and N meningitidis, leading to a significant reduction in life-threatening invasive diseases in many countries worldwide.

One of these emerging digital technologies, blockchain, has unique characteristics (eg, immutability, decentralisation, and transparency) that can be useful in multiple domains (eg, management of electronic medical records and access rights, and mobile health). We conducted a systematic review of COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related applications of blockchain in health care. We identified relevant reports published in MEDLINE, SpringerLink, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore, ScienceDirect, arXiv, and Google Scholar up to July 29, 2021. Articles that included both clinical and technical designs, with or without prototype development, were included. A total of 85 375 articles were evaluated, with 415 full length reports (37 related to COVID-19 and 378 not related to COVID-19) eventually included in the final analysis. The main COVID-19-related applications reported were pandemic control and surveillance, immunity or vaccine passport monitoring, and contact tracing. The top three non-COVID-19-related applications were management of electronic medical records, internet of things (eg, remote monitoring or mobile health), and supply chain monitoring. Most reports detailed technical performance of the blockchain prototype platforms (277 [66·7%] of 415), whereas nine (2·2%) studies showed real-world clinical application and adoption. The remaining studies (129 [31·1%] of 415) were themselves of a technical design only. The most common platforms used were Ethereum and Hyperledger. Blockchain technology has numerous potential COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related applications in health care. However, much of the current research remains at the technical stage, with few providing actual clinical applications, highlighting the need to translate foundational blockchain technology into clinical use. © 2021 The Author(s).

We, therefore, aimed to develop and evaluate a machine learning-based screening technology using facial photographs to evaluate a child's risk of presenting with a genetic syndrome for use at the point of care. Methods: In this retrospective study, we developed a facial deep phenotyping technology based on deep neural networks and facial statistical shape models to screen children for genetic syndromes. We trained the machine learning models on facial photographs from children (aged <21 years) with a clinical or molecular diagnosis of a genetic syndrome and controls without a genetic syndrome matched for age, sex, and race or ethnicity. Images were obtained from three publicly available databases (the Atlas of Human Malformations in Diverse Populations of the National Human Genome Research Institute, Face2Gene, and the dataset available from Ferry and colleagues) and the archives of the Children's National Hospital (Washington, DC, USA), in addition to photographs taken on a standard smartphone at the Children's National Hospital. We designed a deep learning architecture structured into three neural networks, which performed image standardisation (Network A), facial morphology detection (Network B), and genetic syndrome risk estimation, accounting for phenotypic variations due to age, sex, and race or ethnicity (Network C). Data were divided randomly into 40 groups for cross validation, and the performance of the model was evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in both the total population and stratified by race or ethnicity, age, and sex. Findings: Our dataset included 2800 facial photographs of children (1318 [47%] female and 1482 [53%] male; 1576 [56%] White, 432 [15%] African, 430 [15%] Hispanic, and 362 [13%] Asian). 1400 children with 128 genetic conditions were included (the most prevalent being Williams-Beuren syndrome [19%], Cornelia de Lange syndrome [17%], Down syndrome [16%], 22q11.2 deletion [13%], and Noonan syndrome [12%] syndrome) in addition to 1400 photographs of matched controls. In the total population, our deep learning-based model had an accuracy of 88% (95% CI 87–89) for the detection of a genetic syndrome, with 90% sensitivity (95% CI 88–92) and 86% specificity (95% CI 84–88). Accuracy was greater in White (90%, 89–91) and Hispanic populations (91%, 88–94) than in African (84%, 81–87) and Asian populations (82%, 78–86). Accuracy was also similar in male (89%, 87–91) and female children (87%, 85–89), and similar in children younger than 2 years (86%, 84–88) and children aged 2 years or older (eg, 89% [87–91] for those aged 2 years to <5 years). Interpretation: This genetic screening technology could support early risk stratification at the point of care in global populations, which has the potential accelerate diagnosis and reduce mortality and morbidity through preventive care.

We aimed to assess the efficacy of a novel faster-acting insulin aspart (Fiasp) plus pramlintide fully closed-loop system that does not require meal input. Methods: In this open-label, randomised controlled, crossover, non-inferiority trial we compared the Fiasp (Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark) plus pramlintide closed-loop system with no meal input (fully artificial pancreas) and the Fiasp-alone closed-loop system with precise carbohydrate counting (hybrid artificial pancreas). Adults (≥18 years) who had a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least 12 months, had glycated haemoglobin 12% or lower, and had been on insulin pump therapy for at least 6 months were enrolled at McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada. The Fiasp plus pramlintide fully closed-loop system delivered pramlintide in a basal-bolus manner with a fixed ratio of 10 μg:U relative to insulin. A research staff member counted the carbohydrate content of meals to input in the hybrid closed-loop system. Participants completed the two full-day crossover interventions in a random order allocated by a computer-generated code implementing a blocked randomisation (block size of four). The primary outcome was the percentage of time spent within the glucose target range (3·9–10·0 mmol/L), with a 6% non-inferiority margin, assessed in all participants who completed both interventions. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03800875. Findings: Between Feb 8, 2019, and Sept 19, 2020, we enrolled 28 adults, of whom 24 completed both interventions and were included in analyses. The percentage of time spent in the target range was 74·3% (IQR 61·5–82·8) with the fully closed-loop system versus 78·1% (66·3–87·5) with the hybrid Fiasp-alone closed-loop system (paired difference 2·6%, 95% CI −2·4 to 12·2; non-inferiority p=0·28). Eight (33%) participants had at least one hypoglycaemia event (<3·3 mmol/L) with the fully closed-loop system compared with 14 (58%) participants with the hybrid closed-loop system (2200–2200 h). Non-mild nausea was reported by three (13%) participants and non-mild bloating by one (4%) participant with the fully closed-loop system compared with zero participants with the hybrid closed-loop system. Interpretation: The Fiasp plus pramlintide fully closed-loop system was not non-inferior to the Fiasp-alone hybrid closed-loop system for the overall percentage of time in the glucose target range. However, participants still spent a high percentage of time within the target range with the fully-closed loop system. Outpatient studies comparing the fully closed-loop hybrid systems with patient-estimated, rather than precise, carbohydrate counting are warranted. Funding: Diabetes Canada. © 2021 The Author(s).

We aimed to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence system using chest x-rays and clinical data to predict disease severity and progression in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We did a retrospective study in multiple hospitals in the University of Pennsylvania Health System in Philadelphia, PA, USA, and Brown University affiliated hospitals in Providence, RI, USA. Patients who presented to a hospital in the University of Pennsylvania Health System via the emergency department, with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and with an available chest x-ray from their initial presentation or admission, were retrospectively identified and randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets (7:1:2). Using the chest x-rays as input to an EfficientNet deep neural network and clinical data, models were trained to predict the binary outcome of disease severity (ie, critical or non-critical). The deep-learning features extracted from the model and clinical data were used to build time-to-event models to predict the risk of disease progression. The models were externally tested on patients who presented to an independent multicentre institution, Brown University affiliated hospitals, and compared with severity scores provided by radiologists. Findings: 1834 patients who presented via the University of Pennsylvania Health System between March 9 and July 20, 2020, were identified and assigned to the model training (n=1285), validation (n=183), or testing (n=366) sets. 475 patients who presented via the Brown University affiliated hospitals between March 1 and July 18, 2020, were identified for external testing of the models. When chest x-rays were added to clinical data for severity prediction, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) increased from 0·821 (95% CI 0·796–0·828) to 0·846 (0·815–0·852; p<0·0001) on internal testing and 0·731 (0·712–0·738) to 0·792 (0·780–0 ·803; p<0·0001) on external testing. When deep-learning features were added to clinical data for progression prediction, the concordance index (C-index) increased from 0·769 (0·755–0·786) to 0·805 (0·800–0·820; p<0·0001) on internal testing and 0·707 (0·695–0·729) to 0·752 (0·739–0·764; p<0·0001) on external testing. The image and clinical data combined model had significantly better prognostic performance than combined severity scores and clinical data on internal testing (C-index 0·805 vs 0·781; p=0·0002) and external testing (C-index 0·752 vs 0·715; p<0·0001). Interpretation: In patients with COVID-19, artificial intelligence based on chest x-rays had better prognostic performance than clinical data or radiologist-derived severity scores. Using artificial intelligence, chest x-rays can augment clinical data in predicting the risk of progression to critical illness in patients with COVID-19.

It has been argued that explainable AI will engender trust with the health-care workforce, provide transparency into the AI decision making process, and potentially mitigate various kinds of bias. In this Viewpoint, we argue that this argument represents a false hope for explainable AI and that current explainability methods are unlikely to achieve these goals for patient-level decision support. We provide an overview of current explainability techniques and highlight how various failure cases can cause problems for decision making for individual patients. In the absence of suitable explainability methods, we advocate for rigorous internal and external validation of AI models as a more direct means of achieving the goals often associated with explainability, and we caution against having explainability be a requirement for clinically deployed models. © 2021 The Author(s).

A deep learning-based bowel preparation assessment system based on the Boston bowel preparation scale (BBPS) has been previously established to calculate the automatic BBPS (e-BBPS) score (ranging 0–20). The aims of this study were to investigate whether there was a statistically inverse relationship between the e-BBPS score and the ADR, and to determine the threshold of e-BBPS score for adequate bowel preparation in colonoscopy screening. Methods: In this prospective, observational study, we trained and internally validated the e-BBPS system using retrospective colonoscopy images and videos from the Endoscopy Center of Wuhan University, annotated by endoscopists. We externally validated the system using colonoscopy images and videos from the First People's Hospital of Yichang and the Third Hospital of Wuhan. To prospectively validate the system, we recruited consecutive patients at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University aged between 18 and 75 years undergoing colonoscopy. The exclusion criteria included: contraindication to colonoscopy, family polyposis syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, history of surgery for colorectal or colorectal cancer, known or suspected bowel obstruction or perforation, patients who were pregnant or lactating, inability to receive caecal intubation, and lumen obstruction. We did colonoscopy procedures and collected withdrawal videos, which were reviewed and the e-BBPS system was applied to all colon segments. The primary outcome of this study was ADR, defined as the proportion of patients with one or more conventional adenomas detected during colonoscopy. We calculated the ADR of each e-BBPS score and did a correlation analysis using Spearman analysis. Findings: From May 11 to Aug 10, 2020, 616 patients underwent screening colonoscopies, which evaluated. There was a significant inverse correlation between the e-BBPS score and ADR (Spearman's rank −0·976, p<0·010). The ADR for the e-BBPS scores 1–8 was 28·57%, 28·68%, 26·79%, 19·19%, 17·57%, 17·07%, 14·81%, and 0%, respectively. According to the 25% ADR standard for screening colonoscopy, an e-BBPS score of 3 was set as a threshold to guarantee an ADR of more than 25%, and so high-quality endoscopy. Patients with scores of more than 3 had a significantly lower ADR than those with a score of 3 or less (ADR 15·93% vs 28·03%, p<0·001, 95% CI 0·28–0·66, odds ratio 0·43). Interpretation: The e-BBPS system has potential to provide a more objective and refined threshold for the quantification of adequate bowel preparation.

Physiological monitoring is foundational to the care of these vulnerable patients to assess neonatal cardiopulmonary status, guide medical intervention, and determine readiness for safe discharge. However, most existing physiological monitoring systems require multiple electrodes and sensors, which are linked to wires tethered to wall-mounted display units, to adhere to the skin. For neonates, these systems can cause skin injury, prevent kangaroo mother care, and complicate basic clinical care. Novel, wireless, and biointegrated sensors provide opportunities to enhance monitoring capabilities, reduce iatrogenic injuries, and promote family-centric care. Early validation data have shown performance equivalent to (and sometimes exceeding) standard-of-care monitoring systems in premature neonates cared for in high-income countries. The reusable nature of these sensors and compatibility with low-cost mobile phones have the future potential to enable substantially lower monitoring costs compared with existing systems. Deployment at scale, in low-income countries, holds the promise of substantial improvements in neonatal outcomes. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We therefore aimed to develop a novel deep learning pipeline to predict the status of key molecular pathways and mutations from whole-slide images of haematoxylin and eosin-stained colorectal cancer slides as an alternative to current tests. Methods: In this retrospective study, we used 502 diagnostic slides of primary colorectal tumours from 499 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas colon and rectal cancer (TCGA-CRC-DX) cohort and developed a weakly supervised deep learning framework involving three separate convolutional neural network models. Whole-slide images were divided into equally sized tiles and model 1 (ResNet18) extracted tumour tiles from non-tumour tiles. These tumour tiles were inputted into model 2 (adapted ResNet34), trained by iterative draw and rank sampling to calculate a prediction score for each tile that represented the likelihood of a tile belonging to the molecular labels of high mutation density (vs low mutation density), microsatellite instability (vs microsatellite stability), chromosomal instability (vs genomic stability), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-high (vs CIMP-low), BRAFmut (vs BRAFWT), TP53mut (vs TP53WT), and KRASWT (vs KRASmut). These scores were used to identify the top-ranked titles from each slide, and model 3 (HoVer-Net) segmented and classified the different types of cell nuclei in these tiles. We calculated the area under the convex hull of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) as a model performance measure and compared our results with those of previously published methods. Findings: Our iterative draw and rank sampling method yielded mean AUROCs for the prediction of hypermutation (0·81 [SD 0·03] vs 0·71), microsatellite instability (0·86 [0·04] vs 0·74), chromosomal instability (0·83 [0·02] vs 0·73), BRAFmut (0·79 [0·01] vs 0·66), and TP53mut (0·73 [0·02] vs 0·64) in the TCGA-CRC-DX cohort that were higher than those from previously published methods, and an AUROC for KRASmut that was similar to previously reported methods (0·60 [SD 0·04] vs 0·60). Mean AUROC for predicting CIMP-high status was 0·79 (SD 0·05). We found high proportions of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and necrotic tumour cells to be associated with microsatellite instability, and high proportions of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and a low proportion of necrotic tumour cells to be associated with hypermutation. Interpretation: After large-scale validation, our proposed algorithm for predicting clinically important mutations and molecular pathways, such as microsatellite instability, in colorectal cancer could be used to stratify patients for targeted therapies with potentially lower costs and quicker turnaround times than sequencing-based or immunohistochemistry-based approaches.

We aimed to investigate whether cardiovascular risk is associated with increased risk of acute respiratory infection and acute cardiovascular events after acute respiratory infection using 10 years of linked electronic health record (EHR) data in England. Methods: In this retrospective, population-based cohort study we used EHRs from primary care providers registered on the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD and Aurum databases in England. Eligible individuals were aged 40–64 years, did not have established cardiovascular disease or a chronic health condition that would make them eligible for influenza vaccination, were registered at a general practice contributing to the CPRD, and had linked Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care data in England from Sept 1, 2008, to Aug 31, 2018. We classified cardiovascular risk on the basis of diagnosed hypertension and overall predicted cardiovascular risk, estimated by use of the QRISK2 risk-prediction tool (comparing a score of ≥10% [increased risk] with a score of <10% [low risk]). Using multivariable Poisson regression models, we calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for systemic acute respiratory infection. Among individuals who had an acute respiratory infection, we used multivariable Cox regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of acute cardiovascular events within 1 year of infection. Findings: We identified 6 075 321 individuals aged 40–64 years with data in the CPRD and linked data in the Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care database between Sept 1, 2008, and Aug 31, 2018. Of these individuals, 4 212 930 (including 526 480 [12·5%] with hypertension and 607 087 [14·4%] with a QRISK2 score of ≥10%) were included in the assessment of the incidence of acute respiratory infection. After adjusting for confounders (age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, body-mass index, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and consultation frequency in the hypertension analysis; and alcohol consumption and consultation frequency in the QRISK2 analysis), the incidence of acute respiratory infection was higher in individuals with hypertension than those without (IRR 1·04 [95% CI 1·03–1·05]) and higher in those with a QRISK2 score of 10% or higher than in those with a QRISK2 score of less than 10% (1·39 [1·37–1·40]). Of the 442 408 individuals who had an acute respiratory infection, 4196 (0·9%) had an acute cardiovascular event within 1 year of infection. After adjustment (for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, body-mass index, alcohol consumption, and smoking status in the hypertension analysis; and for alcohol consumption in the QRISK2 analysis), hypertension (HR 1·98 [95% CI 1·83–2·15]) and a QRISK2 score of 10% or higher (3·65 [3·42–3·89]) were associated with a substantially increased risk of acute cardiovascular events after acute respiratory infection. Interpretation: People with increased cardiovascular risk but without diagnosed cardiovascular disease, measured by diagnosed hypertension or overall predicted cardiovascular risk, could benefit from influenza and pneumococcal vaccine prioritisation to reduce their risk of both acute respiratory infection and cardiovascular complications following an acute respiratory infection.

The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an opportunity to assess how well equipped the UK is to leverage health information technology and apply the principles of a national learning health and care system in response to a major public health shock. With the experience acquired during the pandemic, each country within the UK should now re-evaluate their digital health and care strategies. After leaving the EU, UK countries now need to decide to what extent they wish to engage with European efforts to promote interoperability between electronic health records. Major priorities for strengthening health information technology in the UK include achieving the optimal balance between top-down and bottom-up implementation, improving usability and interoperability, developing capacity for handling, processing, and analysing data, addressing privacy and security concerns, and encouraging digital inclusivity. Current and future opportunities include integrating electronic health records across health and care providers, investing in health data science research, generating real-world data, developing artificial intelligence and robotics, and facilitating public–private partnerships. Many ethical challenges and unintended consequences of implementation of health information technology exist. To address these, there is a need to develop regulatory frameworks for the development, management, and procurement of artificial intelligence and health information technology systems, create public–private partnerships, and ethically and safely apply artificial intelligence in the National Health Service. © 2021 The Author(s).

Methods: Analyses considered the effects of low-to-moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids, LABA, and LAMA compared with LABA and LAMA alone, outcome incidences, and preference weights assigned to averted moderate-to-severe exacerbations (benefit) and severe pneumonia, candidiasis, and dysphonia (harm). Using exponential models, we estimated the preference weight-adjusted 2-year net clinical benefit (ie, benefits outweighing harms) indices. Exacerbation risk thresholds for triggering inhaled corticosteroids, LABA, and LAMA were established when the probability of a 2-year net clinical benefit reached 60%. We estimated the proportion of patients benefiting from added inhaled corticosteroids using an externally validated prediction model for acute exacerbations in primary care. Findings: Adding low-to-moderate dose inhaled corticosteroids to LABA and LAMA provided a net clinical benefit in patients with a 2-year baseline exacerbation risk of 54–83%. Low-dose inhaled corticosteroids showed a net clinical benefit if the baseline risk was 40–91%, but not at higher doses. The benefit was modified by blood eosinophil count (BEC) and age. Although no net benefit was associated with a BEC of less than 150 cells per μL, patients with a BEC of 150 cells per μL or more had a net benefit from low-dose inhaled corticosteroids with a 2-year exacerbation risk of 32–95% in those aged 40–79 years and 41–93% in those older than 80 years. A moderate dose of inhaled corticosteroids showed a net benefit in patients younger than 80 years with a BEC of 150 cells per μL or more at 52–86% 2-year exacerbation risk. Depending on the subgroups, the proportion of patients with a net benefit from added inhaled corticosteroids ranged from 0 to 68%. Interpretation: The net clinical benefit of adding different inhaled corticosteroid doses to LABA and LAMA varies greatly with exacerbation risk, BEC, and age. Personalised treatment decisions based on these factors and predicted exacerbation risks might reduce overtreatment and undertreatment with inhaled corticosteroids.

We therefore aimed to develop and validate deep learning-based classifiers to detect microsatellite instability and EBV status from routine histology slides. Methods: In this retrospective, multicentre study, we collected tissue samples from ten cohorts of patients with gastric cancer from seven countries (South Korea, Switzerland, Japan, Italy, Germany, the UK and the USA). We trained a deep learning-based classifier to detect microsatellite instability and EBV positivity from digitised, haematoxylin and eosin stained resection slides without annotating tumour containing regions. The performance of the classifier was assessed by within-cohort cross-validation in all ten cohorts and by external validation, for which we split the cohorts into a five-cohort training dataset and a five-cohort test dataset. We measured the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for detection of microsatellite instability and EBV status. Microsatellite instability and EBV status were determined to be detectable if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the AUROC was above 0·5. Findings: Across the ten cohorts, our analysis included 2823 patients with known microsatellite instability status and 2685 patients with known EBV status. In the within-cohort cross-validation, the deep learning-based classifier could detect microsatellite instability status in nine of ten cohorts, with AUROCs ranging from 0·597 (95% CI 0·522–0·737) to 0·836 (0·795–0·880) and EBV status in five of eight cohorts, with AUROCs ranging from 0·819 (0·752–0·841) to 0·897 (0·513–0·966). Training a classifier on the pooled training dataset and testing it on the five remaining cohorts resulted in high classification performance with AUROCs ranging from 0·723 (95% CI 0·676–0·794) to 0·863 (0·747–0·969) for detection of microsatellite instability and from 0·672 (0·403–0·989) to 0·859 (0·823–0·919) for detection of EBV status. Interpretation: Classifiers became increasingly robust when trained on pooled cohorts. After prospective validation, this deep learning-based tissue classification system could be used as an inexpensive predictive biomarker for immunotherapy in gastric cancer.

Our study aimed to train a clinically applicable DLS for fundus diseases using data derived from the real world, and externally test the model using fundus photographs collected prospectively from the settings in which the model would most likely be adopted. Methods: In this national real-world evidence study, we trained a DLS, the Comprehensive AI Retinal Expert (CARE) system, to identify the 14 most common retinal abnormalities using 207 228 colour fundus photographs derived from 16 clinical settings with different disease distributions. CARE was internally validated using 21 867 photographs and externally tested using 18 136 photographs prospectively collected from 35 real-world settings across China where CARE might be adopted, including eight tertiary hospitals, six community hospitals, and 21 physical examination centres. The performance of CARE was further compared with that of 16 ophthalmologists and tested using datasets with non-Chinese ethnicities and previously unused camera types. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04213430, and is currently closed. Findings: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the internal validation set was 0·955 (SD 0·046). AUC values in the external test set were 0·965 (0·035) in tertiary hospitals, 0·983 (0·031) in community hospitals, and 0·953 (0·042) in physical examination centres. The performance of CARE was similar to that of ophthalmologists. Large variations in sensitivity were observed among the ophthalmologists in different regions and with varying experience. The system retained strong identification performance when tested using the non-Chinese dataset (AUC 0·960, 95% CI 0·957–0·964 in referable diabetic retinopathy). Interpretation: Our DLS (CARE) showed satisfactory performance for screening multiple retinal abnormalities in real-world settings using prospectively collected fundus photographs, and so could allow the system to be implemented and adopted for clinical care.

We consider opportunities for predictive analytics and routinely collected administrative data to evaluate how overdose could be reduced among people with opioid use disorder. Specifically, we summarise global trends in opioid use and overdoses; describe the use of big data in research into opioid overdose; consider the potential for predictive modelling, including machine learning, for prevention and monitoring of opioid overdoses; and outline the challenges and risks relating to the use of big data and machine learning in reducing harms that are related to opioid use. Future research for improving the coverage and provision of existing interventions, treatments, and resources for opioid use disorder requires collaboration of multiple agencies. Predictive modelling could transport the concept of stratified medicine to public health through novel methods, such as predictive modelling and emulated trials for evaluating diagnoses and prognoses of opioid use disorder, predicting treatment response, and providing targeted treatment recommendations. © 2021 The Author(s).

We aimed to develop a dynamic artificial intelligence approach to enhance risk stratification for kidney transplant recipients by generating continuously refined predictions of survival using updates of clinical data. Methods: In this observational study, we used data from adult recipients of kidney transplants from 18 academic transplant centres in Europe, the USA, and South America, and a cohort of patients from six randomised controlled trials. The development cohort comprised patients from four centres in France, with all other patients included in external validation cohorts. To build deeply phenotyped cohorts of transplant recipients, the following data were collected in the development cohort: clinical, histological, immunological variables, and repeated measurements of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria (measured using the proteinuria to creatininuria ratio). To develop a dynamic prediction system based on these clinical assessments and repeated measurements, we used a Bayesian joint models—an artificial intelligence approach. The prediction performances of the model were assessed via discrimination, through calculation of the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC), and calibration. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04258891. Findings: 13 608 patients were included (3774 in the development cohort and 9834 in the external validation cohorts) and contributed 89 328 patient-years of data, and 416 510 eGFR and proteinuria measurements. Bayesian joint models showed that recipient immunological profile, allograft interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, allograft inflammation, and repeated measurements of eGFR and proteinuria were independent risk factors for allograft survival. The final model showed accurate calibration and very high discrimination in the development cohort (overall dynamic AUC 0·857 [95% CI 0·847–0·866]) with a persistent improvement in AUCs for each new repeated measurement (from 0·780 [0·768–0·794] to 0·926 [0·917–0·932]; p<0·0001). The predictive performance was confirmed in the external validation cohorts from Europe (overall AUC 0·845 [0·837–0·854]), the USA (overall AUC 0·820 [0·808–0·831]), South America (overall AUC 0·868 [0·856–0·880]), and the cohort of patients from randomised controlled trials (overall AUC 0·857 [0·840–0·875]). Interpretation: Because of its dynamic design, this model can be continuously updated and holds value as a bedside tool that could refine the prognostic judgements of clinicians in everyday practice, hence enhancing precision medicine in the transplant setting.

During this time, testing criteria broadened and health-care policies matured. We aimed to test whether there were consistent associations of symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 test status across three surveillance platforms in three countries (two platforms per country), during periods of testing and policy changes. Methods: For this observational study, we used data of observations from three volunteer COVID-19 digital surveillance platforms (Carnegie Mellon University and University of Maryland Facebook COVID-19 Symptom Survey, ZOE COVID Symptom Study app, and the Corona Israel study) targeting communities in three countries (Israel, the UK, and the USA; two platforms per country). The study population included adult respondents (age 18–100 years at baseline) who were not health-care workers. We did logistic regression of self-reported symptoms on self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test status (positive or negative), adjusted for age and sex, in each of the study cohorts. We compared odds ratios (ORs) across platforms and countries, and we did meta-analyses assuming a random effects model. We also evaluated testing policy changes, COVID-19 incidence, and time scales of duration of symptoms and symptom-to-test time. Findings: Between April 1 and July 31, 2020, 514 459 tests from over 10 million respondents were recorded in the six surveillance platform datasets. Anosmia–ageusia was the strongest, most consistent symptom associated with a positive COVID-19 test (robust aggregated rank one, meta-analysed random effects OR 16·96, 95% CI 13·13–21·92). Fever (rank two, 6·45, 4·25–9·81), shortness of breath (rank three, 4·69, 3·14–7·01), and cough (rank four, 4·29, 3·13–5·88) were also highly associated with test positivity. The association of symptoms with test status varied by duration of illness, timing of the test, and broader test criteria, as well as over time, by country, and by platform. Interpretation: The strong association of anosmia–ageusia with self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 test was consistently observed, supporting its validity as a reliable COVID-19 signal, regardless of the participatory surveillance platform, country, phase of illness, or testing policy. These findings show that associations between COVID-19 symptoms and test positivity ranked similarly in a wide range of scenarios. Anosmia, fever, and respiratory symptoms consistently had the strongest effect estimates and were the most appropriate empirical signals for symptom-based public health surveillance in areas with insufficient testing or benchmarking capacity. Collaborative syndromic surveillance could enhance real-time epidemiological investigations and public health utility globally.

The novel method of x-ray dark-field chest imaging might fill this gap but has not yet been studied in living humans. Enabling the assessment of microstructural changes in lung parenchyma, this technique presents a more sensitive alternative to conventional chest x-rays, and yet requires only a fraction of the dose applied in CT. We studied the application of this technique to assess pulmonary emphysema in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: In this diagnostic accuracy study, we designed and built a novel dark-field chest x-ray system (Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany)—which is also capable of simultaneously acquiring a conventional thorax radiograph (7 s, 0·035 mSv effective dose). Patients who had undergone a medically indicated chest CT were recruited from the department of Radiology and Pneumology of our site (Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany). Patients with pulmonary pathologies, or conditions other than COPD, that might influence lung parenchyma were excluded. For patients with different disease stages of pulmonary emphysema, x-ray dark-field images and CT images were acquired and visually assessed by five readers. Pulmonary function tests (spirometry and body plethysmography) were performed for every patient and for a subgroup of patients the measurement of diffusion capacity was performed. Individual patient datasets were statistically evaluated using correlation testing, rank-based analysis of variance, and pair-wise post-hoc comparison. Findings: Between October, 2018 and December, 2019 we enrolled 77 patients. Compared with CT-based parameters (quantitative emphysema ρ=–0·27, p=0·089 and visual emphysema ρ=–0·45, p=0·0028), the dark-field signal (ρ=0·62, p<0·0001) yields a stronger correlation with lung diffusion capacity in the evaluated cohort. Emphysema assessment based on dark-field chest x-ray features yields consistent conclusions with findings from visual CT image interpretation and shows improved diagnostic performance than conventional clinical tests characterising emphysema. Pair-wise comparison of corresponding test parameters between adjacent visual emphysema severity groups (CT-based, reference standard) showed higher effect sizes. The mean effect size over the group comparisons (absent–trace, trace–mild, mild–moderate, and moderate–confluent or advanced destructive visual emphysema grades) for the COPD assessment test score is 0·21, for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/functional vital capacity is 0·25, for FEV1% of predicted is 0·23, for residual volume % of predicted is 0·24, for CT emphysema index is 0·35, for dark-field signal homogeneity within lungs is 0·38, for dark-field signal texture within lungs is 0·38, and for dark-field-based emphysema severity is 0·42. Interpretation: X-ray dark-field chest imaging allows the diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema in patients with COPD because this technique provides relevant information representing the structural condition of lung parenchyma. This technique might offer a low radiation dose alternative to CT in COPD and potentially other lung disorders.

Geographic atrophy has no proven treatment or method for easy detection. Rapid, reliable, and objective detection and quantification of geographic atrophy from optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal scans is necessary for disease monitoring, prognostic research, and to serve as clinical endpoints for therapy development. To this end, we aimed to develop and validate a fully automated method to detect and quantify geographic atrophy from OCT. Methods: We did a deep-learning model development and external validation study on OCT retinal scans at Moorfields Eye Hospital Reading Centre and Clinical AI Hub (London, UK). A modified U-Net architecture was used to develop four distinct deep-learning models for segmentation of geographic atrophy and its constituent retinal features from OCT scans acquired with Heidelberg Spectralis. A manually segmented clinical dataset for model development comprised 5049 B-scans from 984 OCT volumes selected randomly from 399 eyes of 200 patients with geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration, enrolled in a prospective, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of geographic atrophy (FILLY study). Performance was externally validated on an independently recruited dataset from patients receiving routine care at Moorfields Eye Hospital (London, UK). The primary outcome was segmentation and classification agreement between deep-learning model geographic atrophy prediction and consensus of two independent expert graders on the external validation dataset. Findings: The external validation cohort included 884 B-scans from 192 OCT volumes taken from 192 eyes of 110 patients as part of real-life clinical care at Moorfields Eye Hospital between Jan 1, 2016, and Dec, 31, 2019 (mean age 78·3 years [SD 11·1], 58 [53%] women). The resultant geographic atrophy deep-learning model produced predictions similar to consensus human specialist grading on the external validation dataset (median Dice similarity coefficient [DSC] 0·96 [IQR 0·10]; intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 0·93) and outperformed agreement between human graders (DSC 0·80 [0·28]; ICC 0·79). Similarly, the three independent feature-specific deep-learning models could accurately segment each of the three constituent features of geographic atrophy: retinal pigment epithelium loss (median DSC 0·95 [IQR 0·15]), overlying photoreceptor degeneration (0·96 [0·12]), and hypertransmission (0·97 [0·07]) in the external validation dataset versus consensus grading. Interpretation: We present a fully developed and validated deep-learning composite model for segmentation of geographic atrophy and its subtypes that achieves performance at a similar level to manual specialist assessment. Fully automated analysis of retinal OCT from routine clinical practice could provide a promising horizon for diagnosis and prognosis in both research and real-life patient care, following further clinical validation Funding: Apellis Pharmaceuticals. © 2021 The Author(s).

Various AI algorithms are available commercially, yet there is little impartial evidence on how their performance compares with each other and with radiologists. We aimed to evaluate five commercial AI algorithms for triaging tuberculosis using a large dataset that had not previously been used to train any AI algorithms. Methods: Individuals aged 15 years or older presenting or referred to three tuberculosis screening centres in Dhaka, Bangladesh, between May 15, 2014, and Oct 4, 2016, were recruited consecutively. Every participant was verbally screened for symptoms and received a digital posterior-anterior chest x-ray and an Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) test. All chest x-rays were read independently by a group of three registered radiologists and five commercial AI algorithms: CAD4TB (version 7), InferRead DR (version 2), Lunit INSIGHT CXR (version 4.9.0), JF CXR-1 (version 2), and qXR (version 3). We compared the performance of the AI algorithms with each other, with the radiologists, and with the WHO's Target Product Profile (TPP) of triage tests (≥90% sensitivity and ≥70% specificity). We used a new evaluation framework that simultaneously evaluates sensitivity, proportion of Xpert tests avoided, and number needed to test to inform implementers’ choice of software and selection of threshold abnormality scores. Findings: Chest x-rays from 23 954 individuals were included in the analysis. All five AI algorithms significantly outperformed the radiologists. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 90·81% (95% CI 90·33–91·29) for qXR, 90·34% (89·81–90·87) for CAD4TB, 88·61% (88·03–89·20) for Lunit INSIGHT CXR, 84·90% (84·27–85·54) for InferRead DR, and 84·89% (84·26–85·53) for JF CXR-1. Only qXR (74·3% specificity [95% CI 73·3–74·9]) and CAD4TB (72·9% specificity [72·3–73·5]) met the TPP at 90% sensitivity. All five AI algorithms reduced the number of Xpert tests required by 50% while maintaining a sensitivity above 90%. All AI algorithms performed worse among older age groups (>60 years) and people with a history of tuberculosis. Interpretation: AI algorithms can be highly accurate and useful triage tools for tuberculosis detection in high-burden regions, and outperform human readers.

We aimed to review the literature on the association between digital smart device use and myopia. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE and Embase, and manually searched reference lists for primary research articles investigating smart device (ie, smartphones and tablets) exposure and myopia in children and young adults (aged 3 months to 33 years) from database inception to June 2 (MEDLINE) and June 3 (Embase), 2020. We included studies that investigated myopia-related outcomes of prevalent or incident myopia, myopia progression rate, axial length, or spherical equivalent. Studies were excluded if they were reviews or case reports, did not investigate myopia-related outcomes, or did not investigate risk factors for myopia. Bias was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists for analytical cross-sectional and cohort studies. We categorised studies as follows: category one studies investigated smart device use independently; category two studies investigated smart device use in combination with computer use; and category three studies investigated smart device use with other near-vision tasks that were not screen-based. We extracted unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs), β coefficients, prevalence ratios, Spearman's correlation coefficients, and p values for associations between screen time and incident or prevalent myopia. We did a meta-analysis of the association between screen time and prevalent or incident myopia for category one articles alone and for category one and two articles combined. Random-effects models were used when study heterogeneity was high (I2>50%) and fixed-effects models were used when heterogeneity was low (I2≤50%). Findings: 3325 articles were identified, of which 33 were included in the systematic review and 11 were included in the meta-analysis. Four (40%) of ten category one articles, eight (80%) of ten category two articles, and all 13 category three articles used objective measures to identify myopia (refraction), whereas the remaining studies used questionnaires to identify myopia. Screen exposure was measured by use of questionnaires in all studies, with one also measuring device-recorded network data consumption. Associations between screen exposure and prevalent or incident myopia, an increased myopic spherical equivalent, and longer axial length were reported in five (50%) category one and six (60%) category two articles. Smart device screen time alone (OR 1·26 [95% CI 1·00–1·60]; I2=77%) or in combination with computer use (1·77 [1·28–2·45]; I2=87%) was significantly associated with myopia. The most common sources of risk of bias were that all 33 studies did not include reliable measures of screen time, seven (21%) did not objectively measure myopia, and nine (27%) did not identify or adjust for confounders in the analysis. The high heterogeneity between studies included in the meta-analysis resulted from variability in sample size (range 155–19 934 participants), the mean age of participants (3–16 years), the standard error of the estimated odds of prevalent or incident myopia (0·02–2·21), and the use of continuous (six [55%] of 11) versus categorical (five [46%]) screen time variables Interpretation: Smart device exposure might be associated with an increased risk of myopia. Research with objective measures of screen time and myopia-related outcomes that investigates smart device exposure as an independent risk factor is required. Funding: None. © 2021 The Author(s).

Although previous studies have combined Prostate Imaging–Reporting & Data System (PI-RADS)-based MRI findings with routinely available clinical variables and with deep learning-based imaging predictors, respectively, for prostate cancer risk stratification, none have combined all three. We aimed to construct an integrated nomogram (referred to as ClaD) combining deep learning-based imaging predictions, PI-RADS scoring, and clinical variables to identify clinically significant prostate cancer on biparametric MRI. Methods: In this retrospective multicentre study, we included patients with prostate cancer, with histopathology or biopsy reports and a screening or diagnostic MRI scan in the axial view, from four cohorts in the USA (from University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Cleveland Clinic, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center) and from the PROSTATEx Challenge dataset in the Netherlands. We constructed an integrated nomogram combining deep learning, PI-RADS score, and clinical variables (prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, and lesion volume) using multivariable logistic regression to identify clinically significant prostate cancer on biparametric MRI. We used data from the first three cohorts to train the nomogram and data from the remaining two cohorts for independent validation. We compared the performance of our ClaD integrated nomogram with that of integrated nomograms combining clinical variables with either the deep learning-based imaging predictor (referred to as DIN) or PI-RADS score (referred to as PIN) using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). We also compared the ability of the nomograms to predict biochemical recurrence on a subset of patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy. We report cross-validation AUCs as means for the training set and used AUCs with 95% CIs to assess the performance on the test set. The difference in AUCs between the models were tested for statistical significance using DeLong's test. We used log-rank tests and Kaplan-Meier curves to analyse survival. Findings: We investigated 592 patients (823 lesions) with prostate cancer who underwent 3T multiparametric MRI at five hospitals in the USA between Jan 8, 2009, and June 3, 2017. The training data set consisted of 368 patients from three sites (the PROSTATEx Challenge cohort [n=204], University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center [n=126], and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai [n=38]), and the independent validation data set consisted of 224 patients from two sites (Cleveland Clinic [n=151] and Long Island Jewish Medical Center [n=73]). The ClaD clinical nomogram yielded an AUC of 0·81 (95% CI 0·76–0·85) for identification of clinically significant prostate cancer in the validation data set, significantly improving performance over the DIN (0·74 [95% CI 0·69–0·80], p=0·0005) and PIN (0·76 [0·71–0·81], p<0·0001) nomograms. In the subset of patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy (n=81), the ClaD clinical nomogram resulted in a significant separation in Kaplan-Meier survival curves between patients with and without biochemical recurrence (HR 5·92 [2·34–15·00], p=0·044), whereas the DIN (1·22 [0·54–2·79], p=0·65) and PIN nomograms did not (1·30 [0·62–2·71], p=0·51). Interpretation: Risk stratification of patients with prostate cancer using the integrated ClaD nomogram could help to identify patients with prostate cancer who are at low risk, very low risk, and favourable intermediate risk, who might be candidates for active surveillance, and could also help to identify patients with lethal prostate cancer who might benefit from adjuvant therapy.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the PainChek Infant, a point-of-care mobile application that uses automated facial evaluation and analysis in the assessment of procedural pain in infants. Methods: Video recordings of 40 infants were randomly chosen from a purposely assembled digital library of 410 children undergoing immunisation as part of their standard care in Prishtina, Kosovo, between April 4, 2017, and July 11, 2018. For each infant recording, four 10 s video segments were extracted, corresponding to baseline, vaccine preparation, during vaccination, and recovery. Four trained assessors did pain assessments on the video segments of 30 infants, using PainChek Infant standard, PainChek Infant adaptive, the Neonatal Facial Coding System-Revised (NFCS-R) single, the NFCS-R multiple, and the Observer administered Visual Analogue Scale (ObsVAS), on two separate occasions. PainChek Infant's performance was compared to NFCS-R and ObsVAS using correlation in changes in pain scores, intra-rater and inter-rater reliability, and internal consistency. Findings: 4303 pain assessments were completed in two separate testing sessions, on Aug 31, and Oct 19, 2020. The study involved videos of 40 infants aged 2·2–6·9 months (median age 3·4 months [IQR 2·3–4·5]). All pain assessment tools showed significant changes in the recorded pain scores across the four video segments (p≤0·0006). All tools were found to be responsive to procedure-induced pain, with the degree of change in pain scores not influenced by pre-vaccination pain levels. PainChek Infant pain scores showed good correlation with NFCS-R and ObsVAS scores (r=0·82–0·88; p<0·0001). PainChek Infant also showed good to excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC=0·81–0·97, p<0·001) and high levels of internal consistency (α=0·82–0·97). Interpretation: PainChek Infant's use of automated facial expression analysis could offer a valid and reliable means of assessing and monitoring procedural pain in infants. Its clinical utility in clinical practice requires further research. Funding: PainChek. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Histological evaluation of tumour stroma is limited by access to tissue, spatial heterogeneity, and temporal evolution. We aimed to develop a radiological signature for non-invasive assessment of tumour stroma and treatment outcomes. Methods: In this multicentre, retrospective study, we analysed CT images and outcome data of 2209 patients with resected gastric cancer from five independent cohorts recruited from two centres (Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University [Guangzhou, China] and Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center [Guangzhou, China]). Patients with histologically confirmed gastric cancer, at least 15 lymph nodes harvested, preoperative abdominal CT available, and complete clinicopathological and follow-up data were eligible for inclusion. Tumour tissue was collected for patients in the training cohort (321 patients), internal validation cohort one (246 patients), and external validation cohort one (128 patients). Four stroma classes were defined according to the protein expression of α-smooth muscle actin and periostin assessed by immunohistochemistry. The primary objective was to predict the histologically based stroma classes by using preoperative CT images. We trained a deep convolutional neural network model using the training cohort and tested the model in the internal and external validation cohort one. We evaluated the model's association with prognosis in the training cohort, two internal, and two external validation cohorts and compared outcomes of patients who received or did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Findings: The deep-learning model achieved a high diagnostic accuracy for assessing tumour stroma in both internal validation cohort one (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0·96–0·98]) and external validation cohort one (AUC 0·89–0·94). The stromal imaging signature was significantly associated with disease-free survival and overall survival in all cohorts (p<0·0001). The predicted stroma classes remained an independent prognostic factor adjusting for clinicopathological variables including tumour size, stage, differentiation, and Lauren histology. In patients with stage II or III disease in predicted stroma classes one and two subgroups, patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy had improved survival compared with those who did not (in those with stage II disease hazard ratio [HR] 0·48 [95% CI 0·29–0·77], p=0·0021; and in those with stage III disease HR 0·70 [0·57–0·85], p=0·00042). However, in the other two subgroups adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with survival and might even be detrimental in the predicted stroma class 4 subgroup (HR 1·48 [1·08–2·03], p=0·013). Interpretation: The deep-learning model could allow for accurate and non-invasive evaluation of tumour stroma from CT images in gastric cancer. The radiographical model predicted chemotherapy outcomes and could be used in combination with clinicopathological criteria to refine prognosis and inform treatment decisions of patients with gastric cancer.

These are diagnoses that typically require specialist assessment or measurement with multiple unconnected pieces of equipment. Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches might be effective for risk stratification and to identify individuals at highest risk of visual loss. However, unresolved challenges for AI medical studies remain, including paucity of transparency, auditability, and traceability. Methods: In this retrospective multicohort study, we developed and tested retinal photograph-based deep learning algorithms for detection of myopic macular degeneration and high myopia, using a total of 226 686 retinal images. First we trained and internally validated the algorithms on datasets from Singapore, and then externally tested them on datasets from China, Taiwan, India, Russia, and the UK. We also compared the performance of the deep learning algorithms against six human experts in the grading of a randomly selected dataset of 400 images from the external datasets. As proof of concept, we used a blockchain-based AI platform to demonstrate the real-world application of secure data transfer, model transfer, and model testing across three sites in Singapore and China. Findings: The deep learning algorithms showed robust diagnostic performance with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves [AUC] of 0·969 (95% CI 0·959–0·977) or higher for myopic macular degeneration and 0·913 (0·906–0·920) or higher for high myopia across the external testing datasets with available data. In the randomly selected dataset, the deep learning algorithms outperformed all six expert graders in detection of each condition (AUC of 0·978 [0·957–0·994] for myopic macular degeneration and 0·973 [0·941–0·995] for high myopia). We also successfully used blockchain technology for data transfer, model transfer, and model testing between sites and across two countries. Interpretation: Deep learning algorithms can be effective tools for risk stratification and screening of myopic macular degeneration and high myopia among the large global population with myopia. The blockchain platform developed here could potentially serve as a trusted platform for performance testing of future AI models in medicine. Funding: None. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, population mobility differs across locations, which could reduce the effectiveness of pandemic control measures. Here we assess the extent to which socioeconomic factors are associated with reductions in population mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic, at both the city level in China and at the country level worldwide. Methods: In this retrospective, observational study, we obtained anonymised daily mobile phone location data for 358 Chinese cities from Baidu, and for 121 countries from Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. We assessed the intra-city movement intensity, inflow intensity, and outflow intensity of each Chinese city between Jan 25 (when the national emergency response was implemented) and Feb 18, 2020 (when population mobility was lowest) and compared these data to the corresponding lunar calendar period from the previous year (Feb 5 to March 1, 2019). Chinese cities were classified into four socioeconomic index (SEI) groups (high SEI, high–middle SEI, middle SEI, and low SEI) and the association between socioeconomic factors and changes in population mobility were assessed using univariate and multivariable linear regression. At the country level, we compared six types of mobility (residential, transit stations, workplaces, retail and recreation, parks, and groceries and pharmacies) 35 days after the implementation of the national emergency response in each country and compared these to data from the same day of the week in the baseline period (Jan 3 to Feb 6, 2020). We assessed associations between changes in the six types of mobility and the country's sociodemographic index using univariate and multivariable linear regression. Findings: The reduction in intra-city movement intensity in China was stronger in cities with a higher SEI than in those with a lower SEI (r=–0·47, p<0·0001). However, reductions in inter-city movement flow (both inflow and outflow intensity) were not associated with SEI and were only associated with government control measures. In the country-level analysis, countries with higher sociodemographic and Universal Health Coverage indexes had greater reductions in population mobility (ie, in transit stations, workplaces, and retail and recreation) following national emergency declarations than those with lower sociodemographic and Universal Health Coverage indexes. A higher sociodemographic index showed a greater reduction in mobility in transit stations (r=–0·27, p=0·0028), workplaces (r=–0·34, p=0·0002), and areas retail and recreation (rxs=–0·30, p=0·0012) than those with a lower sociodemographic index. Interpretation: Although COVID-19 outbreaks are more frequently reported in larger cities, our analysis shows that future policies should prioritise the reduction of risks in areas with a low socioeconomic level—eg, by providing financial assistance and improving public health messaging. However, our study design only allows us to assess associations, and a long-term study is needed to decipher causality.

However, the scale of the problem is unquantified, impeding development of effective mitigations. We aimed to ascertain what has happened to general practice contacts for acute physical and mental health outcomes during the pandemic. Methods: Using de-identified electronic health records from the Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) Aurum (covering 13% of the UK population), between 2017 and 2020, we calculated weekly primary care contacts for selected acute physical and mental health conditions: anxiety, depression, self-harm (fatal and non-fatal), severe mental illness, eating disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, acute alcohol-related events, asthma exacerbation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, acute cardiovascular events (cerebrovascular accident, heart failure, myocardial infarction, transient ischaemic attacks, unstable angina, and venous thromboembolism), and diabetic emergency. Primary care contacts included remote and face-to-face consultations, diagnoses from hospital discharge letters, and secondary care referrals, and conditions were identified through primary care records for diagnoses, symptoms, and prescribing. Our overall study population included individuals aged 11 years or older who had at least 1 year of registration with practices contributing to CPRD Aurum in the specified period, but denominator populations varied depending on the condition being analysed. We used an interrupted time-series analysis to formally quantify changes in conditions after the introduction of population-wide restrictions (defined as March 29, 2020) compared with the period before their introduction (defined as Jan 1, 2017 to March 7, 2020), with data excluded for an adjustment-to-restrictions period (March 8–28). Findings: The overall population included 9 863 903 individuals on Jan 1, 2017, and increased to 10 226 939 by Jan 1, 2020. Primary care contacts for almost all conditions dropped considerably after the introduction of population-wide restrictions. The largest reductions were observed for contacts for diabetic emergencies (odds ratio 0·35 [95% CI 0·25–0·50]), depression (0·53 [0·52–0·53]), and self-harm (0·56 [0·54–0·58]). In the interrupted time-series analysis, with the exception of acute alcohol-related events (0·98 [0·89–1·10]), there was evidence of a reduction in contacts for all conditions (anxiety 0·67 [0·66–0·67], eating disorders 0·62 [0·59–0·66], obsessive-compulsive disorder [0·69 [0·64–0·74]], self-harm 0·56 [0·54–0·58], severe mental illness 0·80 [0·78–0·83], stroke 0·59 [0·56–0·62], transient ischaemic attack 0·63 [0·58–0·67], heart failure 0·62 [0·60–0·64], myocardial infarction 0·72 [0·68–0·77], unstable angina 0·72 [0·60–0·87], venous thromboembolism 0·94 [0·90–0·99], and asthma exacerbation 0·88 [0·86–0·90]). By July, 2020, except for unstable angina and acute alcohol-related events, contacts for all conditions had not recovered to pre-lockdown levels. Interpretation: There were substantial reductions in primary care contacts for acute physical and mental conditions following the introduction of restrictions, with limited recovery by July, 2020. Further research is needed to ascertain whether these reductions reflect changes in disease frequency or missed opportunities for care. Maintaining health-care access should be a key priority in future public health planning, including further restrictions. The conditions we studied are sufficiently severe that any unmet need will have substantial ramifications for the people with the conditions as well as health-care provision.

In an era of increasing health-care costs and limited financial resources, identifying surgical patients at a high risk of postoperative complications and providing personalised precision medicine-based treatment strategies provides an obvious pathway for reducing patient morbidity and mortality. We aimed to leverage deep learning to create, through training on structured electronic health-care data, a multilabel deep neural network to predict surgical postoperative complications that would outperform available models in surgical risk prediction. Methods: In this retrospective study, we used data on 58 input features, including demographics, laboratory values, and 30-day postoperative complications, from the American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, which collects data from 722 hospitals from around 15 countries. We queried the entire adult (≥18 years) database for patients who had surgery between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2018. We then identified all patients who were treated at a large midwestern US academic medical centre, excluded them from the base dataset, and reserved this independent group for final model testing. We then randomly created a training set and a validation set from the remaining cases. We developed three deep neural network models with increasing numbers of input variables and so increasing levels of complexity. Output variables comprised mortality and 18 different postoperative complications. Overall morbidity was defined as any of 16 postoperative complications. Model performance was evaluated on the test set using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared with previous metrics from the ACS-Surgical Risk Calculator (ACS-SRC). We evaluated resistance to changes in the underlying patient population on a subset of the test set, comprising only patients who had emergency surgery. Results were also compared with the Predictive OpTimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk (POTTER) calculator. Findings: 5 881 881 surgical patients, with 2941 unique Current Procedural Terminology codes, were included in this study, with 4 694 488 in the training set, 1 173 622 in the validation set, and 13 771 in the test set. The mean AUCs for the validation set were 0·864 (SD 0·053) for model 1, 0·871 (0·055) for model 2, and 0·882 (0·053) for model 3. The mean AUCs for the test set were 0·859 (SD 0·063) for model 1, 0·863 (0·064) for model 2, and 0·874 (0·061) for model 3. The mean AUCs of each model outperformed previously published performance metrics from the ACS-SRC, with a direct correlation between increasing model complexity and performance. Additionally, when tested on a subgroup of patients who had emergency surgery, our models outperformed previously published POTTER metrics. Interpretation: We have developed unified prediction models, based on deep neural networks, for predicting surgical postoperative complications. The models were generally superior to previously published surgical risk prediction tools and appeared robust to changes in the underlying patient population.

We aimed to externally validate a risk prediction algorithm (QCovid) to estimate mortality outcomes from COVID-19 in adults in England. Methods: We did a population-based cohort study using the UK Office for National Statistics Public Health Linked Data Asset, a cohort of individuals aged 19–100 years, based on the 2011 census and linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, the General Practice Extraction Service data for pandemic planning and research, and radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy records. The primary outcome was time to COVID-19 death, defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 death as per death certification. Two periods were used: (1) Jan 24 to April 30, 2020, and (2) May 1 to July 28, 2020. We assessed the performance of the QCovid algorithms using measures of discrimination and calibration. Using predicted 90-day risk of COVID-19 death, we calculated r2 values, Brier scores, and measures of discrimination and calibration with corresponding 95% CIs over the two time periods. Findings: We included 34 897 648 adults aged 19–100 years resident in England. 26 985 (0·08%) COVID-19 deaths occurred during the first period and 13 177 (0·04%) during the second. The algorithms had good discrimination and calibration in both periods. In the first period, they explained 77·1% (95% CI 76·9–77·4) of the variation in time to death in men and 76·3% (76·0–76·6) in women. The D statistic was 3·761 (3·732–3·789) for men and 3·671 (3·640–3·702) for women and Harrell's C was 0·935 (0·933–0·937) for men and 0·945 (0·943–0·947) for women. Similar results were obtained for the second time period. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted risks of death, the sensitivity for identifying deaths in the first period was 65·94% for men and 71·67% for women. Interpretation: The QCovid population-based risk algorithm performed well, showing high levels of discrimination for COVID-19 deaths in men and women for both time periods. QCovid has the potential to be dynamically updated as the pandemic evolves and, therefore, has potential use in guiding national policy.

This evaluation currently uses only the most recent risk factor assessment. We aimed to examine whether 5-year changes in SCORE and ASCVD risk scores are associated with future cardiovascular disease risk. Methods: We analysed data from the Whitehall II longitudinal, prospective cohort study for individuals with no history of stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention, definite angina, heart failure, or peripheral artery disease. Participants underwent clinical examinations in 5-year intervals between Aug 7, 1991, and Dec 6, 2016, and were followed up for incident cardiovascular disease until Oct 2, 2019. Levels of, and 5-year changes in, cardiovascular disease risk were assessed using the SCORE and ASCVD risk scores and were analysed as predictors of cardiovascular disease. Harrell's C index, continuous net reclassification improvement, the Akaike information criterion, and calibration analysis were used to assess whether incorporating change in risk scores into a model including only a single risk score assessment improved the predictive performance. We assessed the levels of, and 5-year changes in, SCORE and ASCVD risk scores as predictors of cardiovascular disease and disease-free life-years using Cox proportional hazards and flexible parametric survival models. Findings: 7574 participants (5233 [69·1%] men, 2341 [30·9%] women) aged 40–75 years were included in analyses of risk score change between April 24, 1997, and Oct 2, 2019. During a mean follow-up of 18·7 years (SD 5·5), 1441 (19·0%; 1042 [72·3%] men and 399 [27·7%] women) participants developed cardiovascular disease. Adding 5-year change in risk score to a model that included only a single risk score assessment improved model performance according to Harrell's C index (from 0·685 to 0·690, change 0·004 [95% CI 0·000 to 0·008] for SCORE; from 0·699 to 0·700, change 0·001 [0·000 to 0·003] for ASCVD), the Akaike information criterion (from 17 255 to 17 200, change −57 [95% CI −97 to −13] for SCORE; from 14 739 to 14 729, change −10 [–28 to 7] for ASCVD), and the continuous net reclassification index (0·353 [95% CI 0·234 to 0·447] for SCORE; 0·232 [0·030 to 0·344] for ASCVD). Both favourable and unfavourable changes in SCORE and ASCVD were associated with cardiovascular disease risk and disease-free life-years. The associations were seen in both sexes and all age groups up to the age of 75 years. At the age of 45 years, each 2-unit improvement in risk scores was associated with an additional 1·3 life-years (95% CI 0·4 to 2·2) free of cardiovascular disease for SCORE and an additional 0·9 life-years (95% CI 0·5 to 1·3) for ASCVD. At age 65 years, this same improvement was associated with an additional 0·4 life-years (95% CI 0·0 to 0·7) free of cardiovascular disease for SCORE and 0·3 life-years (95% CI 0·1 to 0·5) for ASCVD. These models were developed into an interactive calculator, which enables estimation of the number of cardiovascular disease-free life-years for an individual as a function of two risk score measurements. Interpretation: Changes in the SCORE and ASCVD risk scores over time inform cardiovascular disease risk prediction beyond a single risk score assessment. Repeat data might allow more accurate cardiovascular risk stratification and strengthen the evidence base for decisions on preventive interventions.

To date, these models have only considered the culmination or peak of symptoms, which is not suitable for the early detection of infection. We aimed to estimate the probability of an individual being infected with SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of early self-reported symptoms to enable timely self-isolation and urgent testing. Methods: In this large-scale, prospective, epidemiological surveillance study, we used prospective, observational, longitudinal, self-reported data from participants in the UK on 19 symptoms over 3 days after symptoms onset and COVID-19 PCR test results extracted from the COVID-19 Symptom Study mobile phone app. We divided the study population into a training set (those who reported symptoms between April 29, 2020, and Oct 15, 2020) and a test set (those who reported symptoms between Oct 16, 2020, and Nov 30, 2020), and used three models to analyse the self-reported symptoms: the UK's National Health Service (NHS) algorithm, logistic regression, and the hierarchical Gaussian process model we designed to account for several important variables (eg, specific COVID-19 symptoms, comorbidities, and clinical information). Model performance to predict COVID-19 positivity was compared in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the test set. For the hierarchical Gaussian process model, we also evaluated the relevance of symptoms in the early detection of COVID-19 in population subgroups stratified according to occupation, sex, age, and body-mass index. Findings: The training set comprised 182 991 participants and the test set comprised 15 049 participants. When trained on 3 days of self-reported symptoms, the hierarchical Gaussian process model had a higher prediction AUC (0·80 [95% CI 0·80–0·81]) than did the logistic regression model (0·74 [0·74–0·75]) and the NHS algorithm (0·67 [0·67–0·67]). AUCs for all models increased with the number of days of self-reported symptoms, but were still high for the hierarchical Gaussian process model at day 1 (0·73 [95% CI 0·73–0·74]) and day 2 (0·79 [0·78–0·79]). At day 3, the hierarchical Gaussian process model also had a significantly higher sensitivity, but a non-statistically lower specificity, than did the two other models. The hierarchical Gaussian process model also identified different sets of relevant features to detect COVID-19 between younger and older subgroups, and between health-care workers and non-health-care workers. When used during different pandemic periods, the model was robust to changes in populations. Interpretation: Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection is feasible with our model. Such early detection is crucial to contain the spread of COVID-19 and efficiently allocate medical resources.

We aimed to develop and validate a dynamic model to predict psychological treatment outcomes, and to compare the model with currently used methods, including expected treatment response models and machine learning models. Methods: In this prediction model development and validation study, we obtained data from two UK studies including patients who had accessed therapy via Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services managed by ten UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts between March, 2012, and June, 2018, to predict treatment outcomes. In study 1, we used data on patient-reported depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9 [PHQ-9]) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 [GAD-7]) symptom measures obtained on a session-by-session basis (Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust dataset; n=2317) to train the Oracle dynamic prediction model using iterative logistic regression analysis. The outcome of interest was reliable and clinically significant improvement in depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptoms. The predictive accuracy of the model was assessed in an external test sample (Cumbria Northumberland Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust dataset; n=2036) using the area under the curve (AUC), positive predictive values (PPVs), and negative predictive values (NPVs). In study 2, we retrained the Oracle algorithm using a multiservice sample (South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, North East London NHS Foundation Trust, Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust; n=42 992) and compared its performance with an expected treatment response model and five machine learning models (Bayesian updating algorithm, elastic net regularisation, extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, and neural networks based on a multilayer perceptron algorithm) in an external test sample (Whittington Health NHS Trust; Barnet Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust; Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust; and Humber NHS Foundation Trust; n=30 026). Findings: The Oracle algorithm trained using iterative logistic regressions generalised well to external test samples, explaining up to 47·3% of variability in treatment outcomes. Prediction accuracy was modest at session one (AUC 0·59 [95% CI 0·55–0·62], PPV 0·63, NPV 0·61), but improved over time, reaching high prediction accuracy (AUC 0·81 [0·77–0·86], PPV 0·79, NPV 0·69) as early as session seven. The performance of the Oracle model was similar to complex (eg, including patient profiling variables) and computationally intensive machine learning models (eg, neural networks based on a multilayer perceptron algorithm, extreme gradient boosting). Furthermore, the predictive accuracy of a more simple dynamic algorithm including only baseline and index-session scores was comparable to more complex algorithms that included additional predictors modelling sample-level and individual-level variability. Overall, the Oracle algorithm significantly outperformed the expected treatment response model (mean AUC 0·80 vs 0·70, p<0·0001]). Interpretation: Dynamic prediction models using sparse and readily available symptom measures are capable of predicting psychotherapy outcomes with high accuracy.

However, studies have shown gadolinium deposition in the brain after repeated GBCA administration with yet unknown clinical significance. We aimed to assess the feasibility and diagnostic value of synthetic post-contrast T1-weighted MRI generated from pre-contrast MRI sequences through deep convolutional neural networks (dCNN) for tumour response assessment in neuro-oncology. Methods: In this multicentre, retrospective cohort study, we used MRI examinations to train and validate a dCNN for synthesising post-contrast T1-weighted sequences from pre-contrast T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. We used MRI scans with availability of these sequences from 775 patients with glioblastoma treated at Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany (775 MRI examinations); 260 patients who participated in the phase 2 CORE trial (1083 MRI examinations, 59 institutions); and 505 patients who participated in the phase 3 CENTRIC trial (3147 MRI examinations, 149 institutions). Separate training runs to rank the importance of individual sequences and (for a subset) diffusion-weighted imaging were conducted. Independent testing was performed on MRI data from the phase 2 and phase 3 EORTC-26101 trial (521 patients, 1924 MRI examinations, 32 institutions). The similarity between synthetic and true contrast enhancement on post-contrast T1-weighted MRI was quantified using the structural similarity index measure (SSIM). Automated tumour segmentation and volumetric tumour response assessment based on synthetic versus true post-contrast T1-weighted sequences was performed in the EORTC-26101 trial and agreement was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots. Findings: The median SSIM score for predicting contrast enhancement on synthetic post-contrast T1-weighted sequences in the EORTC-26101 test set was 0·818 (95% CI 0·817–0·820). Segmentation of the contrast-enhancing tumour from synthetic post-contrast T1-weighted sequences yielded a median tumour volume of 6·31 cm3 (5·60 to 7·14), thereby underestimating the true tumour volume by a median of −0·48 cm3 (−0·37 to −0·76) with the concordance correlation coefficient suggesting a strong linear association between tumour volumes derived from synthetic versus true post-contrast T1-weighted sequences (0·782, 0·751–0·807, p<0·0001). Volumetric tumour response assessment in the EORTC-26101 trial showed a median time to progression of 4·2 months (95% CI 4·1–5·2) with synthetic post-contrast T1-weighted and 4·3 months (4·1–5·5) with true post-contrast T1-weighted sequences (p=0·33). The strength of the association between the time to progression as a surrogate endpoint for predicting the patients' overall survival in the EORTC-26101 cohort was similar when derived from synthetic post-contrast T1-weighted sequences (hazard ratio of 1·749, 95% CI 1·282–2·387, p=0·0004) and model C-index (0·667, 0·622–0·708) versus true post-contrast T1-weighted MRI (1·799, 95% CI 1·314–2·464, p=0·0003) and model C-index (0·673, 95% CI 0·626–0·711). Interpretation: Generating synthetic post-contrast T1-weighted MRI from pre-contrast MRI using dCNN is feasible and quantification of the contrast-enhancing tumour burden from synthetic post-contrast T1-weighted MRI allows assessment of the patient's response to treatment with no significant difference by comparison with true post-contrast T1-weighted sequences with administration of GBCAs. This finding could guide the application of dCNN in radiology to potentially reduce the necessity of GBCA administration. Funding: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. © 2021 The Author(s).

For some individuals with early-stage epithelioid tumours, a good prognosis by current guidelines can progress rapidly; for others with advanced sarcomatoid cancers, a poor prognosis can progress slowly. Therefore, we aimed to develop and validate a machine-learning tool—known as OncoCast-MPM—that could create a model for patient prognosis. Methods: We did a retrospective study looking at malignant pleural mesothelioma tumours using next-generation sequencing from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT). We collected clinical, pathological, and routine next-generation sequencing data from consecutive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY, USA), as well as the MSK-IMPACT data. Together, these data comprised the MSK-IMPACT cohort. Using OncoCast-MPM, an open-source, web-accessible, machine-learning risk-prediction model, we integrated available data to create risk scores that stratified patients into low-risk and high-risk groups. Risk stratification of the MSK-IMPACT cohort was then validated using publicly available malignant pleural mesothelioma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (ie, the TCGA cohort). Findings: Between Feb 15, 2014, and Jan 28, 2019, we collected MSK-IMPACT data from the tumour tissue of 194 patients in the MSK-IMPACT cohort. The median overall survival was higher in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group as determined by OncoCast-MPM (30·8 months [95% CI 22·7–36·2] vs 13·9 months [10·7–18·0]; hazard ratio [HR] 3·0 [95% CI 2·0–4·5]; p<0·0001). No single factor or gene alteration drove risk differentiation. OncoCast-MPM was validated against the TCGA cohort, which consisted of 74 patients. The median overall survival was higher in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group (23·6 months [95% CI 15·1–28·4] vs 13·6 months [9·8–17·9]; HR 2·3 [95% CI 1·3–3·8]; p=0·0019). Although stage-based risk stratification was unable to differentiate survival among risk groups at 3 years in the MSK-IMPACT cohort (31% for early-stage disease vs 30% for advanced-stage disease; p=0·90), the OncoCast-MPM-derived 3-year survival was significantly higher in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group (40% vs 7%; p=0·0052). Interpretation: OncoCast-MPM generated accurate, individual patient-level risk assessment scores. After prospective validation with the TCGA cohort, OncoCast-MPM might offer new opportunities for enhanced risk stratification of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma in clinical trials and drug development.

An important factor in its under-recognition is the variability in chest radiograph interpretation for ARDS. We sought to train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect ARDS findings on chest radiographs. Methods: CNNs were pretrained on 595 506 radiographs from two centres to identify common chest findings (eg, opacity and effusion), and then trained on 8072 radiographs annotated for ARDS by multiple physicians using various transfer learning approaches. The best performing CNN was tested on chest radiographs in an internal and external cohort, including a subset reviewed by six physicians, including a chest radiologist and physicians trained in intensive care medicine. Chest radiograph data were acquired from four US hospitals. Findings: In an internal test set of 1560 chest radiographs from 455 patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, a CNN could detect ARDS with an area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0·92 (95% CI 0·89–0·94). In the subgroup of 413 images reviewed by at least six physicians, its AUROC was 0·93 (95% CI 0·88–0·96), sensitivity 83·0% (95% CI 74·0–91·1), and specificity 88·3% (95% CI 83·1–92·8). Among images with zero of six ARDS annotations (n=155), the median CNN probability was 11%, with six (4%) assigned a probability above 50%. Among images with six of six ARDS annotations (n=27), the median CNN probability was 91%, with two (7%) assigned a probability below 50%. In an external cohort of 958 chest radiographs from 431 patients with sepsis, the AUROC was 0·88 (95% CI 0·85–0·91). When radiographs annotated as equivocal were excluded, the AUROC was 0·93 (0·92–0·95). Interpretation: A CNN can be trained to achieve expert physician-level performance in ARDS detection on chest radiographs. Further research is needed to evaluate the use of these algorithms to support real-time identification of ARDS patients to ensure fidelity with evidence-based care or to support ongoing ARDS research.

We developed and validated a novel cardiovascular risk stratification system based on deep-learning-predicted CAC from retinal photographs. Methods: We used 216 152 retinal photographs from five datasets from South Korea, Singapore, and the UK to train and validate the algorithms. First, using one dataset from a South Korean health-screening centre, we trained a deep-learning algorithm to predict the probability of the presence of CAC (ie, deep-learning retinal CAC score, RetiCAC). We stratified RetiCAC scores into tertiles and used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the ability of RetiCAC to predict cardiovascular events based on external test sets from South Korea, Singapore, and the UK Biobank. We evaluated the incremental values of RetiCAC when added to the Pooled Cohort Equation (PCE) for participants in the UK Biobank. Findings: RetiCAC outperformed all single clinical parameter models in predicting the presence of CAC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0·742, 95% CI 0·732–0·753). Among the 527 participants in the South Korean clinical cohort, 33 (6·3%) had cardiovascular events during the 5-year follow-up. When compared with the current CAC risk stratification (0, >0–100, and >100), the three-strata RetiCAC showed comparable prognostic performance with a concordance index of 0·71. In the Singapore population-based cohort (n=8551), 310 (3·6%) participants had fatal cardiovascular events over 10 years, and the three-strata RetiCAC was significantly associated with increased risk of fatal cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] trend 1·33, 95% CI 1·04–1·71). In the UK Biobank (n=47 679), 337 (0·7%) participants had fatal cardiovascular events over 10 years. When added to the PCE, the three-strata RetiCAC improved cardiovascular risk stratification in the intermediate-risk group (HR trend 1·28, 95% CI 1·07–1·54) and borderline-risk group (1·62, 1·04–2·54), and the continuous net reclassification index was 0·261 (95% CI 0·124–0·364). Interpretation: A deep learning and retinal photograph-derived CAC score is comparable to CT scan-measured CAC in predicting cardiovascular events, and improves on current risk stratification approaches for cardiovascular disease events. These data suggest retinal photograph-based deep learning has the potential to be used as an alternative measure of CAC, especially in low-resource settings.

Increased understanding of both aspects can enable better patient management and improve clinical trial design. Previous approaches to modelling Parkinson's disease progression assumed static progression trajectories within subgroups and have not adequately accounted for complex medication effects. Our objective was to develop a statistical progression model of Parkinson's disease that accounts for intra-individual and inter-individual variability and medication effects. Methods: In this longitudinal data study, data were collected for up to 7-years on 423 patients with early Parkinson's disease and 196 healthy controls from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) longitudinal observational study. A contrastive latent variable model was applied followed by a novel personalised input-output hidden Markov model to define disease states. Clinical significance of the states was assessed using statistical tests on seven key motor or cognitive outcomes (mild cognitive impairment, dementia, dyskinesia, presence of motor fluctuations, functional impairment from motor fluctuations, Hoehn and Yahr score, and death) not used in the learning phase. The results were validated in an independent sample of 610 patients with Parkinson's disease from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP). Findings: PPMI data were download July 25, 2018, medication information was downloaded on Sept 24, 2018, and PDBP data were downloaded between June 15 and June 24, 2020. The model discovered eight disease states, which are primarily differentiated by functional impairment, tremor, bradykinesia, and neuropsychiatric measures. State 8, the terminal state, had the highest prevalence of key clinical outcomes including 18 (95%) of 19 recorded instances of dementia. At study outset 4 (1%) of 333 patients were in state 8 and 138 (41%) of 333 patients reached stage 8 by year 5. However, the ranking of the starting state did not match the ranking of reaching state 8 within 5 years. Overall, patients starting in state 5 had the shortest time to terminal state (median 2·75 [95% CI 1·75–4·25] years). Interpretation: We developed a statistical progression model of early Parkinson's disease that accounts for intra-individual and inter-individual variability and medication effects. Our predictive model discovered non-sequential, overlapping disease progression trajectories, supporting the use of non-deterministic disease progression models, and suggesting static subtype assignment might be ineffective at capturing the full spectrum of Parkinson's disease progression.

Few clinical tools are available to identify patients at risk of these complications, which would flag them for screening tests and potentially life-saving interventions. In this retrospective analysis, we aimed to assess the ability of deep learning algorithms of longitudinal data from two prospective cohorts to predict complications resulting in death after liver transplantation over multiple timeframes, compared with logistic regression models. Methods: In this machine learning analysis, model development was done on a set of 42 146 liver transplant recipients (mean age 48·6 years [SD 17·3]; 17 196 [40·8%] women) from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) in the USA. Transferability of the model was further evaluated by fine-tuning on a dataset from the University Health Network (UHN) in Canada (n=3269; mean age 52·5 years [11·1]; 1079 [33·0%] women). The primary outcome was cause of death, as recorded in the databases, due to cardiovascular causes, infection, graft failure, or cancer, within 1 year and 5 years of each follow-up examination after transplantation. We compared the performance of four deep learning models against logistic regression, assessing performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Findings: In both datasets, deep learning models outperformed logistic regression, with the Transformer model achieving the highest AUROCs in both datasets (p<0·0001). The AUROC for the Transformer model across all outcomes in the SRTR dataset was 0·804 (99% CI 0·795–0·854) for 1-year predictions and 0·733 (0·729–0·769) for 5-year predictions. In the UHN dataset, the AUROC for the top-performing deep learning model was 0·807 (0·795–0·842) for 1-year predictions and 0·722 (0·705–0·764) for 5-year predictions. AUROCs ranged from 0·695 (0·680–0·713) for prediction of death from infection within 5 years to 0·859 (0·847–0·871) for prediction of death by graft failure within 1 year. Interpretation: Deep learning algorithms can incorporate longitudinal information to continuously predict long-term outcomes after liver transplantation, outperforming logistic regression models. Physicians could use these algorithms at routine follow-up visits to identify liver transplant recipients at risk for adverse outcomes and prevent these complications by modifying management based on ranked features.

Deep learning has the potential to improve the accuracy of chest x-ray interpretation. We therefore aimed to assess the accuracy of radiologists with and without the assistance of a deep-learning model. Methods: In this retrospective study, a deep-learning model was trained on 821 681 images (284 649 patients) from five data sets from Australia, Europe, and the USA. 2568 enriched chest x-ray cases from adult patients (≥16 years) who had at least one frontal chest x-ray were included in the test dataset; cases were representative of inpatient, outpatient, and emergency settings. 20 radiologists reviewed cases with and without the assistance of the deep-learning model with a 3-month washout period. We assessed the change in accuracy of chest x-ray interpretation across 127 clinical findings when the deep-learning model was used as a decision support by calculating area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for each radiologist with and without the deep-learning model. We also compared AUCs for the model alone with those of unassisted radiologists. If the lower bound of the adjusted 95% CI of the difference in AUC between the model and the unassisted radiologists was more than −0·05, the model was considered to be non-inferior for that finding. If the lower bound exceeded 0, the model was considered to be superior. Findings: Unassisted radiologists had a macroaveraged AUC of 0·713 (95% CI 0·645–0·785) across the 127 clinical findings, compared with 0·808 (0·763–0·839) when assisted by the model. The deep-learning model statistically significantly improved the classification accuracy of radiologists for 102 (80%) of 127 clinical findings, was statistically non-inferior for 19 (15%) findings, and no findings showed a decrease in accuracy when radiologists used the deep-learning model. Unassisted radiologists had a macroaveraged mean AUC of 0·713 (0·645–0·785) across all findings, compared with 0·957 (0·954–0·959) for the model alone. Model classification alone was significantly more accurate than unassisted radiologists for 117 (94%) of 124 clinical findings predicted by the model and was non-inferior to unassisted radiologists for all other clinical findings. Interpretation: This study shows the potential of a comprehensive deep-learning model to improve chest x-ray interpretation across a large breadth of clinical practice.

The social and economic fallout from COVID-19 has further exacerbated gender inequities, through increased domestic violence against women, soaring unemployment rates in women, and increased unpaid familial care taken up by women—all factors that can worsen women's health. Digital health can bolster gender equity through increased access to health care, empowerment of one's own health data, and reduced burden of unpaid care work. Yet, digital health is rarely designed from a gender equity perspective. In this Viewpoint, we show that because of lower access and exclusion from app design, gender imbalance in digital health leadership, and harmful gender stereotypes, digital health is disadvantaging women—especially women with racial or ethnic minority backgrounds. Tackling digital health's gender inequities is more crucial than ever. We explain our feminist intersectionality framework to tackle digital health's gender inequities and provide recommendations for future research. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Observational studies so far have lacked rigorous ascertainment adjustment and international generalisability. We aimed to determine whether use of ACEIs or ARBs is associated with an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. Methods: In this international, open science, cohort analysis, we used electronic health records from Spain (Information Systems for Research in Primary Care [SIDIAP]) and the USA (Columbia University Irving Medical Center data warehouse [CUIMC] and Department of Veterans Affairs Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership [VA-OMOP]) to identify patients aged 18 years or older with at least one prescription for ACEIs and ARBs (target cohort) or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics (THZs; comparator cohort) between Nov 1, 2019, and Jan 31, 2020. Users were defined separately as receiving either monotherapy with these four drug classes, or monotherapy or combination therapy (combination use) with other antihypertensive medications. We assessed four outcomes: COVID-19 diagnosis; hospital admission with COVID-19; hospital admission with pneumonia; and hospital admission with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, or sepsis. We built large-scale propensity score methods derived through a data-driven approach and negative control experiments across ten pairwise comparisons, with results meta-analysed to generate 1280 study effects. For each study effect, we did negative control outcome experiments using a possible 123 controls identified through a data-rich algorithm. This process used a set of predefined baseline patient characteristics to provide the most accurate prediction of treatment and balance among patient cohorts across characteristics. The study is registered with the EU Post-Authorisation Studies register, EUPAS35296. Findings: Among 1 355 349 antihypertensive users (363 785 ACEI or ARB monotherapy users, 248 915 CCB or THZ monotherapy users, 711 799 ACEI or ARB combination users, and 473 076 CCB or THZ combination users) included in analyses, no association was observed between COVID-19 diagnosis and exposure to ACEI or ARB monotherapy versus CCB or THZ monotherapy (calibrated hazard ratio [HR] 0·98, 95% CI 0·84–1·14) or combination use exposure (1·01, 0·90–1·15). ACEIs alone similarly showed no relative risk difference when compared with CCB or THZ monotherapy (HR 0·91, 95% CI 0·68–1·21; with heterogeneity of >40%) or combination use (0·95, 0·83–1·07). Directly comparing ACEIs with ARBs demonstrated a moderately lower risk with ACEIs, which was significant with combination use (HR 0·88, 95% CI 0·79–0·99) and non-significant for monotherapy (0·85, 0·69–1·05). We observed no significant difference between drug classes for risk of hospital admission with COVID-19, hospital admission with pneumonia, or hospital admission with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, or sepsis across all comparisons. Interpretation: No clinically significant increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or hospital admission-related outcomes associated with ACEI or ARB use was observed, suggesting users should not discontinue or change their treatment to decrease their risk of COVID-19.

We developed an automated machine learning algorithm for MWT measurement and compared precision (reproducibility) with that of 11 international experts, using a dataset of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Methods: 60 adult patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, including those carrying hypertrophic cardiomyopathy gene mutations, were recruited at three institutes in the UK from August, 2018, to September, 2019: Barts Heart Centre, University College London Hospital (The Heart Hospital), and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Participants had two cardiovascular magnetic resonance scans (test and retest) on the same day, ensuring no biological variability, using four cardiac MRI scanner models represented across two manufacturers and two field strengths. End-diastolic short-axis MWT was measured in test and retest by 11 international experts (from nine centres in six countries) and an automated machine learning method, which was trained to segment endocardial and epicardial contours on an independent, multicentre, multidisease dataset of 1923 patients. Machine learning MWT measurement was done with a method based on solving Laplace's equation. To assess test–retest reproducibility, we estimated the absolute test–retest MWT difference (precision), the coefficient of variation (CoV) for duplicate measurements, and the number of patients reclassified between test and retest according to different thresholds (MWT >15 mm and >30 mm). We calculated the sample size required to detect a prespecified MWT change between pairs of scans for machine learning and each expert. Findings: 1440 MWT measurements were analysed, corresponding to two scans from 60 participants by 12 observers (11 experts and machine learning). Experts differed in the MWT they measured, ranging from 14·9 mm (SD 4·2) to 19·0 mm (4·7; p<0·0001 for trend). Machine learning-measured mean MWT was 16·8 mm (4·1). Machine learning precision was superior, with a test–retest difference of 0·7 mm (0·6) compared with experts, who ranged from 1·1 mm (0·9) to 3·7 mm (2·0; p values for machine learning vs expert comparison ranging from <0·0001 to 0·0073) and a significantly lower CoV than for all experts (4·3% [95% CI 3·3–5·1] vs 5·7–12·1% across experts). On average, 38 (64%) patients were designated as having MWT greater than 15 mm by machine learning compared with 27 (45%) to 50 (83%) patients by experts; five (8%) patients were reclassified in test–retest by machine learning compared with four (7%) to 12 (20%) by experts. With a cutoff point of more than 30 mm for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, three experts would have changed recommendations between tests a total of four times, but machine learning was consistent. Using machine learning, a clinical trial to detect a 2 mm MWT change would need 2·3 times (range 1·6–4·6) fewer patients. Interpretation: In this preliminary study, machine learning MWT measurement in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is superior to human experts with potential implications for diagnosis, risk stratification, and clinical trials.

The paper sets out policy options to facilitate a secure and trustworthy development of AI and considers health to be one of its most important areas of application. We illustrate that the European Commission's approach, as applied to medical AI, presents some challenges that can be detrimental if not addressed. In particular, we discuss the issues of European values and European data, the update problem of AI systems, and the challenges of new trade-offs such as privacy, cybersecurity, accuracy, and intellectual property rights. We also outline what we view as the most important next steps in the Commission's iterative process. Although the European Commission has done good work in setting out a European approach for AI, we conclude that this approach will be more difficult to implement in health care. It will require careful balancing of core values, detailed consideration of nuances of health and AI technologies, and a keen eye on the political winds and global competition. © 2020 The Author(s).

The emergence of deep learning technology offers new opportunities to revolutionise this clinical referral pathway. We aimed to assess the performance of a newly developed deep learning algorithm for detection of disease-related visual impairment. Methods: In this proof-of-concept study, using retinal fundus images from 15 175 eyes with complete data related to best-corrected visual acuity or pinhole visual acuity from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases Study, we first developed a single-modality deep learning algorithm based on retinal photographs alone for detection of any disease-related visual impairment (defined as eyes from patients with major eye diseases and best-corrected visual acuity of <20/40), and moderate or worse disease-related visual impairment (eyes with disease and best-corrected visual acuity of <20/60). After development of the algorithm, we tested it internally, using a new set of 3803 eyes from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases Study. We then tested it externally using three population-based studies (the Beijing Eye study [6239 eyes], Central India Eye and Medical study [6526 eyes], and Blue Mountains Eye Study [2002 eyes]), and two clinical studies (the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Sight Threatening Diabetic Retinopathy study [971 eyes] and the Outram Polyclinic Study [1225 eyes]). The algorithm's performance in each dataset was assessed on the basis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Findings: In the internal test dataset, the AUC for detection of any disease-related visual impairment was 94·2% (95% CI 93·0–95·3; sensitivity 90·7% [87·0–93·6]; specificity 86·8% [85·6–87·9]). The AUC for moderate or worse disease-related visual impairment was 93·9% (95% CI 92·2–95·6; sensitivity 94·6% [89·6–97·6]; specificity 81·3% [80·0–82·5]). Across the five external test datasets (16 993 eyes), the algorithm achieved AUCs ranging between 86·6% (83·4–89·7; sensitivity 87·5% [80·7–92·5]; specificity 70·0% [66·7–73·1]) and 93·6% (92·4–94·8; sensitivity 87·8% [84·1–90·9]; specificity 87·1% [86·2–88·0]) for any disease-related visual impairment, and the AUCs for moderate or worse disease-related visual impairment ranged between 85·9% (81·8–90·1; sensitivity 84·7% [73·0–92·8]; specificity 74·4% [71·4–77·2]) and 93·5% (91·7–95·3; sensitivity 90·3% [84·2–94·6]; specificity 84·2% [83·2–85·1]). Interpretation: This proof-of-concept study shows the potential of a single-modality, function-focused tool in identifying visual impairment related to major eye diseases, providing more timely and pinpointed referral of patients with disease-related visual impairment from the community to tertiary eye hospitals.

We sought to determine whether commercially available chest x-ray analysis software meet WHO recommendations for minimal sensitivity and specificity as pulmonary tuberculosis triage tests. Methods: We recruited symptomatic adults at the Indus Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. We compared two software, qXR version 2.0 (qXRv2) and CAD4TB version 6.0 (CAD4TBv6), with a reference of mycobacterial culture of two sputa. We assessed qXRv2 using its manufacturer prespecified threshold score for chest x-ray classification as tuberculosis present versus not present. For CAD4TBv6, we used a data-derived threshold, because it does not have a prespecified one. We tested for non-inferiority to preset WHO recommendations (0·90 for sensitivity, 0·70 for specificity) using a non-inferiority limit of 0·05. We identified factors associated with accuracy by stratification and logistic regression. Findings: We included 2198 (92·7%) of 2370 enrolled participants. 2187 (99·5%) of 2198 were HIV-negative, and 272 (12·4%) had culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. For both software, accuracy was non-inferior to WHO-recommended minimum values (qXRv2 sensitivity 0·93 [95% CI 0·89–0·95], non-inferiority p=0·0002; CAD4TBv6 sensitivity 0·93 [0·90–0·96], p<0·0001; qXRv2 specificity 0·75 [0·73–0·77], p<0·0001; CAD4TBv6 specificity 0·69 [0·67–0·71], p=0·0003). Sensitivity was lower in smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis for both software, and in women for CAD4TBv6. Specificity was lower in men and in those with previous tuberculosis, and reduced with increasing age and decreasing body mass index. Smoking and diabetes did not affect accuracy. Interpretation: In an HIV-negative population, these software met WHO-recommended minimal accuracy for pulmonary tuberculosis triage tests. Sensitivity will be lower when smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis is more prevalent. Funding: Canadian Institutes of Health Research. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Consumer wrist-worn tracking devices using photoplethysmography, such as Fitbit, now provide the unique potential of continuously measuring surrogates of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity through the analysis of interbeat intervals. We aimed to leverage wrist-worn trackers to derive and describe diverse measures of cardiac autonomic function among Fitbit device users. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we collected interbeat interval data that are sent to a central database from Fitbit devices during a randomly selected 24 h period. Age, sex, body-mass index, and steps per day in the 90 days preceding the measurement were extracted. Interbeat interval data were cleaned and heart rate variability features were computed. We analysed heart rate variability metrics across the time (measured via the root mean square of successive RR interval differences [RMSSD] and SD of the RR interval [SDRR]), frequency (measured by high-frequency and low-frequency power), and graphical (measured by Poincare plots) domains. We considered 5 min windows for the time and frequency domain metrics and 60 min measurements for graphical domain metrics. Data from participants were analysed to establish the correlation between heart rate variability metrics and age, sex, time of day, and physical activity. We also determined benchmarks for heart rate variability (HRV) metrics among the users. Findings: We included data from 8 203 261 Fitbit users, collected on Sept 1, 2018. HRV metrics decrease with age, and parasympathetic function declines faster than sympathetic function. We observe a strong diurnal variation in the heart rate variability. SDRR, low-frequency power, and Poincare S2 show a significant variation with sex, whereas such a difference is not seen with RMSSD, high-frequency power, and Poincare S1. For males, when measured from 0600 h to 0700 h, the mean low-frequency power decreased by a factor of 66·5% and high-frequency power decreased by a factor of 82·0% from the age of 20 years to 60 years. For females, the equivalent factors were 69·3% and 80·9%, respectively. Comparing low-frequency power between males and females at the ages of 40–41 years, measured from 0600 h to 0700 h, we found excess power in males, with a Cohen's d effect size of 0·33. For high-frequency power, the equivalent effect size was −0·04. Increased daily physical activity, across age and sex, was highly correlated with improvement in diverse measures of heart rate variability in a dose-dependent manner. We provide benchmark tables for RMSSD, SDRR, high and low frequency powers, and Poincare S1 and S2, separately for different ages and sex and computed at two times of the day. Interpretation: Diverse metrics of cardiac autonomic health can be derived from wrist-worn trackers. Empirical distributions of heart rate variability can potentially be used as a framework for individual-level interpretation. Increased physical activity might yield improvement in heart rate variability and requires prospective trials for confirmation. Funding: Fitbit. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Despite several years of research in this area, standard frameworks for aggregating and making use of different data streams from mobile phones are scarce and difficult to generalise across data providers. Here, we examine aggregation principles and procedures for different mobile phone data streams and describe a common syntax for how aggregated data are used in research and policy.

In this scoping review, we selected and examined peer-reviewed empirical studies relating to COVID-19 and social media during the first outbreak from November, 2019, to November, 2020. From an analysis of 81 studies, we identified five overarching public health themes concerning the role of online social media platforms and COVID-19. These themes focused on: surveying public attitudes, identifying infodemics, assessing mental health, detecting or predicting COVID-19 cases, analysing government responses to the pandemic, and evaluating quality of health information in prevention education videos. Furthermore, our Review emphasises the paucity of studies on the application of machine learning on data from COVID-19-related social media and a scarcity of studies documenting real-time surveillance that was developed with data from social media on COVID-19.

These changes are non-specific and have a low detection rate, limiting their potential use as clinically independent diagnostic features. Therefore, we aimed to engineer deep learning models to establish associations between ocular features and major hepatobiliary diseases and to advance automated screening and identification of hepatobiliary diseases from ocular images. Methods: We did a multicentre, prospective study to develop models using slit-lamp or retinal fundus images from participants in three hepatobiliary departments and two medical examination centres. Included participants were older than 18 years and had complete clinical information; participants diagnosed with acute hepatobiliary diseases were excluded. We trained seven slit-lamp models and seven fundus models (with or without hepatobiliary disease [screening model] or one specific disease type within six categories [identifying model]) using a development dataset, and we tested the models with an external test dataset. Additionally, we did a visual explanation and occlusion test. Model performances were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and F1* score. Findings: Between Dec 16, 2018, and July 31, 2019, we collected data from 1252 participants (from the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Affiliated Huadu Hospital of Southern Medical University, and the Nantian Medical Centre of Aikang Health Care [Guangzhou, China]) for the development dataset; between Aug 14, 2019, and Jan 31, 2020, we collected data from 537 participants (from the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and the Huanshidong Medical Centre of Aikang Health Care [Guangzhou, China]) for the test dataset. The AUROC for screening for hepatobiliary diseases of the slit-lamp model was 0·74 (95% CI 0·71–0·76), whereas that of the fundus model was 0·68 (0·65–0·71). For the identification of hepatobiliary diseases, the AUROCs were 0·93 (0·91–0·94; slit-lamp) and 0·84 (0·81–0·86; fundus) for liver cancer, 0·90 (0·88–0·91; slit-lamp) and 0·83 (0·81–0·86; fundus) for liver cirrhosis, and ranged 0·58–0·69 (0·55–0·71; slit-lamp) and 0·62–0·70 (0·58–0·73; fundus) for other hepatobiliary diseases, including chronic viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cholelithiasis, and hepatic cyst. In addition to the conjunctiva and sclera, our deep learning model revealed that the structures of the iris and fundus also contributed to the classification. Interpretation: Our study established qualitative associations between ocular features and major hepatobiliary diseases, providing a non-invasive, convenient, and complementary method for hepatobiliary disease screening and identification, which could be applied as an opportunistic screening tool.

Assessing the effect of lockdown on individual displacements is essential to quantify achievable mobility reductions and identify the factors driving the changes in social dynamics that affected viral diffusion. We aimed to use mobile phone data to study how mobility in France changed before and during lockdown, breaking down our findings by trip distance, user age and residency, and time of day, and analysing regional data and spatial heterogeneities. Methods: For this population-based study, we used temporally resolved travel flows among 1436 administrative areas of mainland France reconstructed from mobile phone trajectories. Data were stratified by age class (younger than 18 years, 18–64 years, and 65 years or older). We distinguished between residents and non-residents and used population data and regional socioeconomic indicators from the French National Statistical Institute. We measured mobility changes before and during lockdown at both local and country scales using a case-crossover framework. We analysed all trips combined and trips longer than 100 km (termed long trips), and separated trips by daytime or night-time, weekdays or weekends, and rush hours. Findings: Lockdown caused a 65% reduction in the countrywide number of displacements (from about 57 million to about 20 million trips per day) and was particularly effective in reducing work-related short-range mobility, especially during rush hour, and long trips. Geographical heterogeneities showed anomalous increases in long-range movements even before lockdown announcement that were tightly localised in space. During lockdown, mobility drops were unevenly distributed across regions (eg, Île-de-France, the region of Paris, went from 585 000 to 117 000 outgoing trips per day). They were strongly associated with active populations, workers employed in sectors highly affected by lockdown, and number of hospitalisations per region, and moderately associated with the socioeconomic level of the regions. Major cities largely shrank their pattern of connectivity, reducing it mainly to short-range commuting (95% of traffic leaving Paris was contained in a 201 km radius before lockdown, which was reduced to 29 km during lockdown). Interpretation: Lockdown was effective in reducing population mobility across scales. Caution should be taken in the timing of policy announcements and implementation, because anomalous mobility followed policy announcements, which might act as seeding events. Conversely, risk aversion might be beneficial in further decreasing mobility in highly affected regions. We also identified socioeconomic and demographic constraints to the efficacy of restrictions. The unveiled links between geography, demography, and timing of the response to mobility restrictions might help to design interventions that minimise invasiveness while contributing to the current epidemic response.

Phenotypically, it is reflected in the diversity of appearance and morphology within cell populations. Computer-extracted features relating to tumour cellular diversity on routine tissue images might correlate with outcome. This study investigated the prognostic ability of computer-extracted features of tumour cellular diversity (CellDiv) from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histology images of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). Methods: In this multicentre, retrospective study, we included 1057 patients with early-stage NSCLC with corresponding diagnostic histology slides and overall survival information from four different centres. CellDiv features quantifying local cellular morphological diversity from H&E-stained histology images were extracted from the tumour epithelium region. A Cox proportional hazards model based on CellDiv was used to construct risk scores for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD; 270 patients) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC; 216 patients) separately using data from two of the cohorts, and was validated in the two remaining independent cohorts (comprising 236 patients with LUAD and 335 patients with LUSC). We used multivariable Cox regression analysis to examine the predictive ability of CellDiv features for 5-year overall survival, controlling for the effects of clinical and pathological parameters. We did a gene set enrichment and Gene Ontology analysis on 405 patients to identify associations with differentially expressed biological pathways implicated in lung cancer pathogenesis. Findings: For prognosis of patients with early-stage LUSC, the CellDiv LUSC model included 11 discriminative CellDiv features, whereas for patients with early-stage LUAD, the model included 23 features. In the independent validation cohorts, patients predicted to be at a higher risk by the univariable CellDiv model had significantly worse 5-year overall survival (hazard ratio 1·48 [95% CI 1·06–2·08]; p=0·022 for The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA] LUSC group, 2·24 [1·04–4·80]; p=0·039 for the University of Bern LUSC group, and 1·62 [1·15–2·30]; p=0·0058 for the TCGA LUAD group). The identified CellDiv features were also found to be strongly associated with apoptotic signalling and cell differentiation pathways. Interpretation: CellDiv features were strongly prognostic of 5-year overall survival in patients with early-stage NSCLC and also associated with apoptotic signalling and cell differentiation pathways. The CellDiv-based risk stratification model could potentially help to determine which patients with early-stage NSCLC might receive added benefit from adjuvant therapy.

Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency in the evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders), and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human–AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret, and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes. © 2020 The Author(s).

We aimed to create a deep-learning system to predict the risk of patients with diabetes developing diabetic retinopathy within 2 years. Methods: We created and validated two versions of a deep-learning system to predict the development of diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetes who had had teleretinal diabetic retinopathy screening in a primary care setting. The input for the two versions was either a set of three-field or one-field colour fundus photographs. Of the 575 431 eyes in the development set 28 899 had known outcomes, with the remaining 546 532 eyes used to augment the training process via multitask learning. Validation was done on one eye (selected at random) per patient from two datasets: an internal validation (from EyePACS, a teleretinal screening service in the USA) set of 3678 eyes with known outcomes and an external validation (from Thailand) set of 2345 eyes with known outcomes. Findings: The three-field deep-learning system had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0·79 (95% CI 0·77–0·81) in the internal validation set. Assessment of the external validation set—which contained only one-field colour fundus photographs—with the one-field deep-learning system gave an AUC of 0·70 (0·67–0·74). In the internal validation set, the AUC of available risk factors was 0·72 (0·68–0·76), which improved to 0·81 (0·77–0·84) after combining the deep-learning system with these risk factors (p<0·0001). In the external validation set, the corresponding AUC improved from 0·62 (0·58–0·66) to 0·71 (0·68–0·75; p<0·0001) following the addition of the deep-learning system to available risk factors. Interpretation: The deep-learning systems predicted diabetic retinopathy development using colour fundus photographs, and the systems were independent of and more informative than available risk factors. Such a risk stratification tool might help to optimise screening intervals to reduce costs while improving vision-related outcomes. Funding: Google. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is poorly understood how and which AI/ML-based medical devices have been approved in the USA and Europe. We searched governmental and non-governmental databases to identify 222 devices approved in the USA and 240 devices in Europe. The number of approved AI/ML-based devices has increased substantially since 2015, with many being approved for use in radiology. However, few were qualified as high-risk devices. Of the 124 AI/ML-based devices commonly approved in the USA and Europe, 80 were first approved in Europe. One possible reason for approval in Europe before the USA might be the potentially relatively less rigorous evaluation of medical devices in Europe. The substantial number of approved devices highlight the need to ensure rigorous regulation of these devices. Currently, there is no specific regulatory pathway for AI/ML-based medical devices in the USA or Europe. We recommend more transparency on how devices are regulated and approved to enable and improve public trust, efficacy, safety, and quality of AI/ML-based medical devices.

In communicative adults, functional MRI (fMRI) has been used to develop multivariate brain activity signatures, which reliably capture elements of human pain experience. We aimed to translate whole-brain fMRI signatures that encode pain perception in adults to the newborn infant brain, to advance understanding of functional brain development and pain perception in early life. Methods: In this cross-sectional, observational study, we recruited adults at the University of Oxford (Oxford, UK) and infants on the postnatal wards of John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford, UK). Healthy full-term infants were eligible for inclusion if they were clinically stable, self-ventilating in air, and had no neurological abnormalities. Infants were consecutively recruited in two cohorts (A and B) due to the installation of a new fMRI scanner using the same recruitment criteria. Adults (aged ≥18 years) were eligible if they were postgraduate students or staff at the University of Oxford. Participants were stimulated with low intensity nociceptive stimuli (64, 128, 256, and 512 mN in adults; 64 and 128 mN in infants) during acquisition of fMRI data. fMRI pain signatures (neurologic pain signature [NPS] and stimulus intensity independent pain signature-1 [SIIPS1]), and four control signatures (the vicarious pain signature, the picture-induced negative emotion signature [PINES], the social rejection signature, and a global signal signature) were applied directly to the adult data and translated to the infant brain. We assessed the concordance of the signatures with the brain responses of adults and infants using cosine similarity scores, and we assessed stimulus intensity encoding of the signature responses using a Spearman rank correlation test. We also assessed brain activity in pro-pain and anti-pain components of the signatures. Findings: Between May 22, 2013, and Jan 29, 2018, we recruited ten healthy participants to the adult cohort (five women and five men; mean age 28·3 years [range 23–36]), 15 infants to infant cohort A (six girls and nine boys; mean postnatal age 4 days [range 1–11]), and 22 infants to infant cohort B (11 girls and 11 boys; mean postnatal age 3 days [range 1–10]). The NPS was activated in both the adults and infants, and reliably encoded stimulus intensity. The NPS was activated in the adult cohort (p<0·0001) and both infant cohorts (p=0·048 for infant cohort A; p=0·001 for infant cohort B). The SIIPS1 was only expressed in adults. Pro-pain brain regions showed similar activation patterns in adults and infants, whereas responses in anti-pain brain regions were divergent. Interpretation: Basic intensity encoding of nociceptive information is similar in adults and infants. However, translation of adult brain signatures to infants indicated substantial differences in infant cerebral processing of nociceptive information, which might reflect their absence of expectation, motivation, and contextualisation associated with pain. This study expands the use of brain activity pain signatures to non-verbal patients and provides a potential research approach to assess the impact of analgesic interventions on brain function in infants.

Methods: We did an open-label, randomised controlled trial of women aged 18–34 years, self-identified as African American or Black, or both, and not pregnant, recruited from 35 states in the USA. Sealed allocation envelopes (in permuted blocks of six and eight, prepared using a random number generator) were opened after enrolment. Intervention participants received an online conversational agent called Gabby that assessed 102 preconception risks and delivered 12 months of tailored dialogue using synthesised speech, non-verbal behaviour, visual aids, and health behaviour change techniques such as motivational interviewing. The control group received a letter listing their preconception risks and encouraging them to talk with a clinician. The primary outcome was the proportion of identified risks at the action or maintenance stage of change at months 6 and 12. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01827215. Findings: From March 11, 2014, through July 8, 2018, 528 women recruited from 35 states and 242 cities across the USA received the Gabby intervention (n=262) or were assigned to the control group (n=266). Participants identified a mean of 21 preconception risks per woman (SD 9·9). In the intention-to-treat analysis, at 6 months, intervention women reported reaching the action or maintenance stage of change for 50·0% (SD 28·9) of those preconception risks identified compared with 42·7% (28·3) in the control group (incidence rate ratio 1·16, 95% CI 1·07–1·26; p=0·0004). This result persisted at 12 months. Interpretation: The Gabby system has the potential to improve women's preconception health. Further research is needed to determine if improving preconception risks impacts outcomes such as preterm delivery.

However, the broader applicability of retinal photograph-based deep learning for predicting other systemic biomarkers and the generalisability of this approach to various populations remains unexplored. Methods: With use of 236 257 retinal photographs from seven diverse Asian and European cohorts (two health screening centres in South Korea, the Beijing Eye Study, three cohorts in the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study, and the UK Biobank), we evaluated the capacities of 47 deep-learning algorithms to predict 47 systemic biomarkers as outcome variables, including demographic factors (age and sex); body composition measurements; blood pressure; haematological parameters; lipid profiles; biochemical measures; biomarkers related to liver function, thyroid function, kidney function, and inflammation; and diabetes. The standard neural network architecture of VGG16 was adopted for model development. Findings: In addition to previously reported systemic biomarkers, we showed quantification of body composition indices (muscle mass, height, and bodyweight) and creatinine from retinal photographs. Body muscle mass could be predicted with an R2 of 0·52 (95% CI 0·51–0·53) in the internal test set, and of 0·33 (0·30–0·35) in one external test set with muscle mass measurement available. The R2 value for the prediction of height was 0·42 (0·40–0·43), of bodyweight was 0·36 (0·34–0·37), and of creatinine was 0·38 (0·37–0·40) in the internal test set. However, the performances were poorer in external test sets (with the lowest performance in the European cohort), with R2 values ranging between 0·08 and 0·28 for height, 0·04 and 0·19 for bodyweight, and 0·01 and 0·26 for creatinine. Of the 47 systemic biomarkers, 37 could not be predicted well from retinal photographs via deep learning (R2≤0·14 across all external test sets). Interpretation: Our work provides new insights into the potential use of retinal photographs to predict systemic biomarkers, including body composition indices and serum creatinine, using deep learning in populations with a similar ethnic background. Further evaluations are warranted to validate these findings and evaluate the clinical utility of these algorithms.

This disruption has caused rapid dynamic fluctuations in demand, capacity, and even contextual aspects of health care. Therefore, the traditional face-to-face patient–physician care model has had to be re-examined in many countries, with digital technology and new models of care being rapidly deployed to meet the various challenges of the pandemic. This Viewpoint highlights new models in ophthalmology that have adapted to incorporate digital health solutions such as telehealth, artificial intelligence decision support for triaging and clinical care, and home monitoring. These models can be operationalised for different clinical applications based on the technology, clinical need, demand from patients, and manpower availability, ranging from out-of-hospital models including the hub-and-spoke pre-hospital model, to front-line models such as the inflow funnel model and monitoring models such as the so-called lighthouse model for provider-led monitoring. Lessons learnt from operationalising these models for ophthalmology in the context of COVID-19 are discussed, along with their relevance for other specialty domains. © 2021 The Author(s).

Although evidence suggests that masks help to curb the spread of the disease, there is little empirical research at the population level. We investigate the association between self-reported mask-wearing, physical distancing, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the USA, along with the effect of statewide mandates on mask uptake. Methods: Serial cross-sectional surveys were administered via a web platform to randomly surveyed US individuals aged 13 years and older, to query self-reports of face mask-wearing. Survey responses were combined with instantaneous reproductive number (Rt) estimates from two publicly available sources, the outcome of interest. Measures of physical distancing, community demographics, and other potential sources of confounding (from publicly available sources) were also assessed. We fitted multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the association between mask-wearing and community transmission control (Rt<1). Additionally, mask-wearing in 12 states was evaluated 2 weeks before and after statewide mandates. Findings: 378 207 individuals responded to the survey between June 3 and July 27, 2020, of which 4186 were excluded for missing data. We observed an increasing trend in reported mask usage across the USA, although uptake varied by geography. A logistic model controlling for physical distancing, population demographics, and other variables found that a 10% increase in self-reported mask-wearing was associated with an increased odds of transmission control (odds ratio 3·53, 95% CI 2·03–6·43). We found that communities with high reported mask-wearing and physical distancing had the highest predicted probability of transmission control. Segmented regression analysis of reported mask-wearing showed no statistically significant change in the slope after mandates were introduced; however, the upward trend in reported mask-wearing was preserved. Interpretation: The widespread reported use of face masks combined with physical distancing increases the odds of SARS-CoV-2 transmission control. Self-reported mask-wearing increased separately from government mask mandates, suggesting that supplemental public health interventions are needed to maximise adoption and help to curb the ongoing epidemic.

However, use of these therapies, if ineffective, might delay initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in some patients. We aimed to determine early predictors of NIRS failure and develop a simple nomogram and online calculator that can identify patients at risk of NIRS failure. Methods: We did a retrospective, multicentre observational study in 23 hospitals designated for patients with COVID-19 in China. Adult patients (≥18 years) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and acute respiratory failure receiving NIRS were enrolled. A training cohort of 652 patients (21 hospitals) was used to identify early predictors of NIRS failure, defined as subsequent need for IMV or death within 28 days after intensive care unit admission. A nomogram was developed by multivariable logistic regression and concordance statistics (C-statistics) computed. C-statistics were validated internally by cross-validation in the training cohort, and externally in a validation cohort of 107 patients (two hospitals). Findings: Patients were enrolled between Jan 1 and Feb 29, 2020. NIV failed in 211 (74%) of 286 patients and HFNC in 204 (56%) of 366 patients in the training cohort. NIV failed in 48 (81%) of 59 patients and HFNC in 26 (54%) of 48 patients in the external validation cohort. Age, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate–oxygenation index (ratio of pulse oximetry oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen to respiratory rate), Glasgow coma scale score, and use of vasopressors on the first day of NIRS in the training cohort were independent risk factors for NIRS failure. Based on the training dataset, the nomogram had a C-statistic of 0·80 (95% CI 0·74–0·85) for predicting NIV failure, and a C-statistic of 0·85 (0·82–0·89) for predicting HFNC failure. C-statistic values were stable in both internal validation (NIV group mean 0·79 [SD 0·10], HFNC group mean 0·85 [0·07]) and external validation (NIV group value 0·88 [95% CI 0·72–0·96], HFNC group value 0·86 [0·72–0·93]). Interpretation: We have developed a nomogram and online calculator that can be used to identify patients with COVID-19 who are at risk of NIRS failure. These patients might benefit from early triage and more intensive monitoring.

However, viral-specific PCR testing has limited sensitivity and results can take up to 72 h for operational reasons. We aimed to develop and validate two early-detection models for COVID-19, screening for the disease among patients attending the emergency department and the subset being admitted to hospital, using routinely collected health-care data (laboratory tests, blood gas measurements, and vital signs). These data are typically available within the first hour of presentation to hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries, within the existing laboratory infrastructure. Methods: We trained linear and non-linear machine learning classifiers to distinguish patients with COVID-19 from pre-pandemic controls, using electronic health record data for patients presenting to the emergency department and admitted across a group of four teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK (Oxford University Hospitals). Data extracted included presentation blood tests, blood gas testing, vital signs, and results of PCR testing for respiratory viruses. Adult patients (>18 years) presenting to hospital before Dec 1, 2019 (before the first COVID-19 outbreak), were included in the COVID-19-negative cohort; those presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2019, and April 19, 2020, with PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included in the COVID-19-positive cohort. Patients who were subsequently admitted to hospital were included in their respective COVID-19-negative or COVID-19-positive admissions cohorts. Models were calibrated to sensitivities of 70%, 80%, and 90% during training, and performance was initially assessed on a held-out test set generated by an 80:20 split stratified by patients with COVID-19 and balanced equally with pre-pandemic controls. To simulate real-world performance at different stages of an epidemic, we generated test sets with varying prevalences of COVID-19 and assessed predictive values for our models. We prospectively validated our 80% sensitivity models for all patients presenting or admitted to the Oxford University Hospitals between April 20 and May 6, 2020, comparing model predictions with PCR test results. Findings: We assessed 155 689 adult patients presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2017, and April 19, 2020. 114 957 patients were included in the COVID-negative cohort and 437 in the COVID-positive cohort, for a full study population of 115 394 patients, with 72 310 admitted to hospital. With a sensitive configuration of 80%, our emergency department (ED) model achieved 77·4% sensitivity and 95·7% specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0·939) for COVID-19 among all patients attending hospital, and the admissions model achieved 77·4% sensitivity and 94·8% specificity (AUROC 0·940) for the subset of patients admitted to hospital. Both models achieved high negative predictive values (NPV; >98·5%) across a range of prevalences (≤5%). We prospectively validated our models for all patients presenting and admitted to Oxford University Hospitals in a 2-week test period. The ED model (3326 patients) achieved 92·3% accuracy (NPV 97·6%, AUROC 0·881), and the admissions model (1715 patients) achieved 92·5% accuracy (97·7%, 0·871) in comparison with PCR results. Sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in negative PCR results improved apparent accuracy (ED model 95·1%, admissions model 94·1%) and NPV (ED model 99·0%, admissions model 98·5%). Interpretation: Our models performed effectively as a screening test for COVID-19, excluding the illness with high-confidence by use of clinical data routinely available within 1 h of presentation to hospital. Our approach is rapidly scalable, fitting within the existing laboratory testing infrastructure and standard of care of hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries.

This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human–AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret, and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial. © 2020 The Author(s).

We aimed to develop a deep learning algorithm on the basis of chest CT for rapid triaging in fever clinics. Methods: We trained a U-Net-based model on unenhanced chest CT scans obtained from 2447 patients admitted to Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Feb 1, 2020, and March 3, 2020 (1647 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and 800 patients without COVID-19) to segment lung opacities and alert cases with COVID-19 imaging manifestations. The ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to triage patients suspected to have COVID-19 was assessed in a large external validation set, which included 2120 retrospectively collected consecutive cases from three fever clinics inside and outside the epidemic centre of Wuhan (Tianyou Hospital [Wuhan, China; area of high COVID-19 prevalence], Xianning Central Hospital [Xianning, China; area of medium COVID-19 prevalence], and The Second Xiangya Hospital [Changsha, China; area of low COVID-19 prevalence]) between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 14, 2020. To validate the sensitivity of the algorithm in a larger sample of patients with COVID-19, we also included 761 chest CT scans from 722 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 treated in a makeshift hospital (Guanggu Fangcang Hospital, Wuhan, China) between Feb 21, 2020, and March 6, 2020. Additionally, the accuracy of AI was compared with a radiologist panel for the identification of lesion burden increase on pairs of CT scans obtained from 100 patients with COVID-19. Findings: In the external validation set, using radiological reports as the reference standard, AI-aided triage achieved an area under the curve of 0·953 (95% CI 0·949–0·959), with a sensitivity of 0·923 (95% CI 0·914–0·932), specificity of 0·851 (0·842–0·860), a positive predictive value of 0·790 (0·777–0·803), and a negative predictive value of 0·948 (0·941–0·954). AI took a median of 0·55 min (IQR: 0·43–0·63) to flag a positive case, whereas radiologists took a median of 16·21 min (11·67–25·71) to draft a report and 23·06 min (15·67–39·20) to release a report. With regard to the identification of increases in lesion burden, AI achieved a sensitivity of 0·962 (95% CI 0·947–1·000) and a specificity of 0·875 (95 %CI 0·833–0·923). The agreement between AI and the radiologist panel was high (Cohen's kappa coefficient 0·839, 95% CI 0·718–0·940). Interpretation: A deep learning algorithm for triaging patients with suspected COVID-19 at fever clinics was developed and externally validated. Given its high accuracy across populations with varied COVID-19 prevalence, integration of this system into the standard clinical workflow could expedite identification of chest CT scans with imaging indications of COVID-19.

Several public datasets containing ophthalmological imaging have been frequently used in machine learning research; however, the total number of datasets containing ophthalmological health information and their respective content is unclear. This Review aimed to identify all publicly available ophthalmological imaging datasets, detail their accessibility, describe which diseases and populations are represented, and report on the completeness of the associated metadata. With the use of MEDLINE, Google's search engine, and Google Dataset Search, we identified 94 open access datasets containing 507 724 images and 125 videos from 122 364 patients. Most datasets originated from Asia, North America, and Europe. Disease populations were unevenly represented, with glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration disproportionately overrepresented in comparison with other eye diseases. The reporting of basic demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and ethnicity was poor, even at the aggregate level. This Review provides greater visibility for ophthalmological datasets that are publicly available as powerful resources for research. Our paper also exposes an increasing divide in the representation of different population and disease groups in health data repositories. The improved reporting of metadata would enable researchers to access the most appropriate datasets for their needs and maximise the potential of such resources. © 2021 The Author(s).

Guidelines on the use of illness severity scores to inform triage decisions for allocation of scarce resources, such as mechanical ventilation, during the current COVID-19 pandemic warrant examination for possible bias in these models. We investigated the performance of the severity scoring systems Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IVa (APACHE IVa), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) across four ethnicities in two large ICU databases to identify possible ethnicity-based bias. Methods: Data from the electronic ICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, built from patient episodes in the USA from 2014–15 and 2001–12, respectively, were analysed for score performance in Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White people after appropriate exclusions. Hospital mortality was the outcome of interest. Discrimination and calibration were determined for all three scoring systems in all four groups, using area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for different ethnicities to assess discrimination, and standardised mortality ratio (SMR) or proxy measures to assess calibration. Findings: We analysed 166 751 participants (122 919 eICU-CRD and 43 832 MIMIC-III). Although measurements of discrimination were significantly different among the groups (AUROC ranging from 0·86 to 0·89 [p=0·016] with APACHE IVa and from 0·75 to 0·77 [p=0·85] with OASIS), they did not display any discernible systematic patterns of bias. However, measurements of calibration indicated persistent, and in some cases statistically significant, patterns of difference between Hispanic people (SMR 0·73 with APACHE IVa and 0·64 with OASIS) and Black people (0·67 and 0·68) versus Asian people (0·77 and 0·95) and White people (0·76 and 0·81). Although calibrations were imperfect for all groups, the scores consistently showed a pattern of overpredicting mortality for Black people and Hispanic people. Similar results were seen using SOFA scores across the two databases. Interpretation: The systematic differences in calibration across ethnicities suggest that illness severity scores reflect statistical bias in their predictions of mortality.

We investigated the effect of a fully automated dCBT-I programme on insomnia severity, sleep–wake patterns, sleep medication use, and daytime impairment. Methods: We did a parallel-group superiority randomised controlled trial comparing dCBT-I with online patient education about sleep. The interventions were available through a free-to-access website, publicised throughout Norway, which incorporated automated screening, informed consent, and randomisation procedures, as well as outcome assessments. Adults (age ≥18 years) who had regular internet access and scored 12 or higher on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were eligible for inclusion, and were allocated (1:1) to receive dCBT-I (consisting of six core interactive sessions to be completed over 9 weeks) or patient education (control group). Participants were masked to group assignment and had no contact with researchers during the intervention period. The primary outcome was the change in ISI score from baseline to 9-week follow-up, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02558647) and is ongoing, with 2-year follow-up assessments planned. Findings: Between Feb 26, 2016, and July 1, 2018, 5349 individuals commenced the online screening process, of which 1497 were ineligible or declined to participate, 2131 discontinued the screening process, and 1721 were randomly allocated (868 to receive dCBT-I and 853 to receive patient education). At 9-week follow-up, 584 (67%) participants in the dCBT-I group and 534 (63%) in the patient education group completed the ISI assessment. The latent growth model showed that participants in the dCBT-I group had a significantly greater reduction in ISI scores from baseline (mean score 19·2 [SD 3·9]) to 9-week follow-up (10·4 [6·2]) than those in the patient education group (from 19·6 [4·0] to 15·2 [5·3]; estimated mean difference −4·7 (95% CI −5·4 to −4·1; Cohen's d −1·21; p<0·001). Compared with patient education, the number needed to treat with dCBT-I was 2·7 (95% CI 2·4 to 3·2) for treatment response (ISI score reduction ≥8) and 3·2 (2·8 to 3·8) for insomnia remission (ISI score <8). No adverse events were reported to the trial team. Interpretation: dCBT-I is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms associated with the insomnia disorder. These findings support the widespread dissemination of dCBT-I. Future research is needed to identify the moderators of response and to improve targeting.

Among the most promising clinical applications of AI is diagnostic imaging, and mounting attention is being directed at establishing and fine-tuning its performance to facilitate detection and quantification of a wide array of clinical conditions. Investigations leveraging computer-aided diagnostics have shown excellent accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of small radiographic abnormalities, with the potential to improve public health. However, outcome assessment in AI imaging studies is commonly defined by lesion detection while ignoring the type and biological aggressiveness of a lesion, which might create a skewed representation of AI's performance. Moreover, the use of non-patient-focused radiographic and pathological endpoints might enhance the estimated sensitivity at the expense of increasing false positives and possible overdiagnosis as a result of identifying minor changes that might reflect subclinical or indolent disease. We argue for refinement of AI imaging studies via consistent selection of clinically meaningful endpoints such as survival, symptoms, and need for treatment. © 2020 The Author(s).

The federally funded Australian MindSpot Clinic provides online and telephone psychological assessment and treatment services to Australian adults. We aimed to summarise demographic characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients registered with MindSpot over the first 7 years of clinic operation. Methods: We used an observational design to review all patients who registered for assessment with the MindSpot Clinic between Jan 1, 2013, and Dec 31, 2019. We descriptively analysed the demographics, service preferences, and baseline symptoms of patients. Among patients enrolled in a digital treatment course, we evaluated scales of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale [GAD-7]), as primary measures of treatment outcome, from the screening assessment to post-treatment and a 3 month follow-up. The Kessler Psychological Distress 10-Item Plus Scale was also used to assess changes in general distress and disability, and course satisfaction was measured post-treatment. Outcomes: A total of 121 652 screening assessments were started, of which 96 018 (78·9%) were completed. The mean age of patients was 35·7 years (SD 13·8) and 88 702 (72·9%) were women. Based on available assessment data, 36 866 (34·5%) of 106 811 participants had never previously spoken to a health professional about their symptoms, and most people self-reported symptoms of anxiety (88 879 [81·9%] of 108 494) or depression (78 803 [72·6%] of 108 494), either alone or in combination, at baseline. 21 745 patients started treatment in a therapist-guided online course, of whom 14 503 (66·7%) completed treatment (≥four of five lessons). Key trends in service use included an increase in the proportion of people using MindSpot primarily for assessment and information, from 52·6% in 2013 to 66·7% in 2019, while the proportion primarily seeking online treatment decreased, from 42·6% in 2013 to 26·7% in 2019. Effect sizes and percentage changes were large for estimated mean scores on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 from assessment to post-treatment (PHQ-9, Cohen's d effect size 1·40 [95% CI 1·37–1·43]; and GAD-7, 1·45 [1·42–1·47]) and the 3 month follow-up (PHQ-9, 1·36 [1·34–1·38]; and GAD-7, 1·42 [1·40–1·44]); proportions of patients with reliable symptom deterioration (score increase of ≥6 points [PHQ-9] or ≥5 points [GAD-7]) were low post-treatment (of 13 058 respondents, 184 [1·4%] had symptom deterioration on the PHQ-9 and 282 [2·2%] on the GAD-7); and patient satisfaction rates were high (12 452 [96·6%] of 12 895 respondents would recommend the course and 12 433 [96·7%] of 12 860 reported the course worthwhile). We also observed small improvements in disability following treatment as measured by days out of role. Interpretation: Our findings indicate improvement in psychological symptoms and positive reception among patients receiving online mental health treatment. These results support the addition of digital services such as MindSpot as a component in contemporary national mental health systems. Funding: None. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Drug repurposing has become a promising approach because of the opportunity for reduced development timelines and overall costs. In the big data era, artificial intelligence (AI) and network medicine offer cutting-edge application of information science to defining disease, medicine, therapeutics, and identifying targets with the least error. In this Review, we introduce guidelines on how to use AI for accelerating drug repurposing or repositioning, for which AI approaches are not just formidable but are also necessary. We discuss how to use AI models in precision medicine, and as an example, how AI models can accelerate COVID-19 drug repurposing. Rapidly developing, powerful, and innovative AI and network medicine technologies can expedite therapeutic development. This Review provides a strong rationale for using AI-based assistive tools for drug repurposing medications for human disease, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 The Author(s).

Models offer a systematic way to investigate transmission dynamics and produce short-term and long-term predictions that explicitly integrate assumptions about biological, behavioural, and epidemiological processes that affect disease transmission, burden, and surveillance. Models have been valuable tools during the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious disease outbreaks, able to generate possible trajectories of disease burden, evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies, and estimate key transmission variables. Particularly given the rapid pace of model development, evaluation, and integration with decision making in emergency situations, it is necessary to understand the benefits and pitfalls of transmission models. We review and highlight key aspects of the history of infectious disease dynamic models, the role of rigorous testing and evaluation, the integration with data, and the successful application of models to guide public health. Rather than being an expansive history of infectious disease models, this Review focuses on how the integration of modelling can continue to be advanced through policy and practice in appropriate and conscientious ways to support the current pandemic response. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, whether mobility restriction is a proportional response to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is unclear. We aimed to develop a model that can quantify the potential effects of various intracity mobility restrictions on the spread of COVID-19. Methods: In this modelling study, we used anonymous and aggregated mobile phone sightings data to build a susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered transmission model for COVID-19 based on the city of Shenzhen, China. We simulated how disease spread changed when we varied the type and magnitude of mobility restrictions in different transmission scenarios, with variables such as the basic reproductive number (R0), length of infectious period, and the number of initial cases. Findings: 331 COVID-19 cases distributed across the ten regions of Shenzhen were reported on Feb 7, 2020. In our basic scenario (R0 of 2·68), mobility reduction of 20–60% within the city had a notable effect on controlling COVID-19 spread: a flattening of the peak number of cases by 33% (95% UI 21–42) and delay to the peak number by 2 weeks with a 20% restriction, 66% (48–75) reduction and 4 week delay with a 40% restriction, and 91% (79–95) reduction and 14 week delay with a 60% restriction. The effects of mobility restriction were increased when combined with reductions of 25% or 50% in transmissibility of the virus. In specific analyses of mobility restrictions for individuals with symptomatic infections and for high-risk regions, these measures also had substantial effects on reducing the spread of COVID-19. For example, the peak of the epidemic was delayed by 2 weeks if the proportion of individuals with symptomatic infections who could move freely was maintained at 20%, and by 4 weeks if two high-risk regions were locked down. The simulation results were also affected by various transmission parameters. Interpretation: Our model shows the effects of various types and magnitudes of mobility restrictions on controlling COVID-19 outbreaks at the city level in Shenzhen, China. The model could help policy makers to establish the optimal combinations of mobility restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially to assess the potential positive effects of mobility restriction on public health in view of the potential negative economic and societal effects.

We did a systematic review of automated or partly automated contact tracing. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, OVID Global Health, EBSCO Medical COVID Information Portal, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, and Google Advanced for articles relevant to COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, influenza, or Ebola virus, published from Jan 1, 2000, to April 14, 2020. We also included studies identified through professional networks up to April 30, 2020. We reviewed all full-text manuscripts. Primary outcomes were the number or proportion of contacts (or subsequent cases) identified. Secondary outcomes were indicators of outbreak control, uptake, resource use, cost-effectiveness, and lessons learnt. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020179822). Of the 4036 studies identified, 110 full-text studies were reviewed and 15 studies were included in the final analysis and quality assessment. No empirical evidence of the effectiveness of automated contact tracing (regarding contacts identified or transmission reduction) was identified. Four of seven included modelling studies that suggested that controlling COVID-19 requires a high population uptake of automated contact-tracing apps (estimates from 56% to 95%), typically alongside other control measures. Studies of partly automated contact tracing generally reported more complete contact identification and follow-up compared with manual systems. Automated contact tracing could potentially reduce transmission with sufficient population uptake. However, concerns regarding privacy and equity should be considered. Well designed prospective studies are needed given gaps in evidence of effectiveness, and to investigate the integration and relative effects of manual and automated systems. Large-scale manual contact tracing is therefore still key in most contexts. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The programme was first rolled out on the Isle of Wight and included version 1 of the NHS contact tracing app. The aim of the study was to make a preliminary assessment of the epidemiological impact of the Test and Trace programme using publicly available data. Methods: We used COVID-19 daily case data from Public Health England to infer incidence of new infections and estimate the reproduction number (R) for each of the 150 Upper-Tier Local Authorities (UTLAs) in England and nationally, before and after the launch of the Test and Trace programme on the Isle of Wight. We used Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods to estimate R and compared the Isle of Wight with other UTLAs using a synthetic control method. Findings: We observed significant decreases in incidence and R on the Isle of Wight immediately after the launch of the Test and Trace programme. The Isle of Wight had a marked reduction in R, from 1·3 before the Test and Trace programme to 0·5 after by one of our measures, and went from having the third highest R before the Test and Trace programme, to the twelfth lowest afterwards compared with other UTLAs. Interpretation: Our results show that the epidemic on the Isle of Wight was controlled quickly and effectively after the launch of Test and Trace. Our findings highlight the need for further research to determine the causes of the reduction in the spread of the disease, as these could be translated into local and national non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies in the period before a treatment or vaccination for COVID-19 becomes available.

The purpose of enhanced assessment was to simulate selection of women for more sensitive screening promoting early detection of cancers that would otherwise be diagnosed as interval cancers or as next-round screen-detected cancers. The aim of the study was to examine how AI could reduce radiologist workload and increase cancer detection. Methods: In this retrospective simulation study, all women diagnosed with breast cancer who attended two consecutive screening rounds were included. Healthy women were randomly sampled from the same cohort; their observations were given elevated weight to mimic a frequency of 0·7% incident cancer per screening interval. Based on the prediction score from a commercially available AI cancer detector, various cutoff points for the decision to channel women to the two new work streams were examined in terms of missed and additionally detected cancer. Findings: 7364 women were included in the study sample: 547 were diagnosed with breast cancer and 6817 were healthy controls. When including 60%, 70%, or 80% of women with the lowest AI scores in the no radiologist stream, the proportion of screen-detected cancers that would have been missed were 0, 0·3% (95% CI 0·0–4·3), or 2·6% (1·1–5·4), respectively. When including 1% or 5% of women with the highest AI scores in the enhanced assessment stream, the potential additional cancer detection was 24 (12%) or 53 (27%) of 200 subsequent interval cancers, respectively, and 48 (14%) or 121 (35%) of 347 next-round screen-detected cancers, respectively. Interpretation: Using a commercial AI cancer detector to triage mammograms into no radiologist assessment and enhanced assessment could potentially reduce radiologist workload by more than half, and pre-emptively detect a substantial proportion of cancers otherwise diagnosed later.

Current models rely on prespecified variables, which limits their performance. We aimed to investigate a novel machine learning approach to develop an improved prognostic model for predicting 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality and compare its performance with existing validated models. Methods: We derived and tested a machine learning-based model using Survival Quilts, an algorithm that automatically selects and tunes ensembles of survival models using clinicopathological variables. Our study involved a US population-based cohort of 171 942 men diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2016, from the prospectively maintained Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. The primary outcome was prediction of 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality. Model discrimination was assessed using the concordance index (c-index), and calibration was assessed using Brier scores. The Survival Quilts model was compared with nine other prognostic models in clinical use, and decision curve analysis was done. Findings: 647 151 men with prostate cancer were enrolled into the SEER database, of whom 171 942 were included in this study. Discrimination improved with greater granularity, and multivariable models outperformed tier-based models. The Survival Quilts model showed good discrimination (c-index 0·829, 95% CI 0·820–0·838) for 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality, which was similar to the top-ranked multivariable models: PREDICT Prostate (0·820, 0·811–0·829) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram (0·787, 0·776–0·798). All three multivariable models showed good calibration with low Brier scores (Survival Quilts 0·036, 95% CI 0·035–0·037; PREDICT Prostate 0·036, 0·035–0·037; MSKCC 0·037, 0·035–0·039). Of the tier-based systems, the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment model (c-index 0·782, 95% CI 0·771–0·793) and Cambridge Prognostic Groups model (0·779, 0·767–0·791) showed higher discrimination for predicting 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality. c-indices for models from the National Comprehensive Cancer Care Network, Genitourinary Radiation Oncologists of Canada, American Urological Association, European Association of Urology, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ranged from 0·711 (0·701–0·721) to 0·761 (0·750–0·772). Discrimination for the Survival Quilts model was maintained when stratified by age and ethnicity. Decision curve analysis showed an incremental net benefit from the Survival Quilts model compared with the MSKCC and PREDICT Prostate models currently used in practice. Interpretation: A novel machine learning-based approach produced a prognostic model, Survival Quilts, with discrimination for 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality similar to the top-ranked prognostic models, using only standard clinicopathological variables. Future integration of additional data will likely improve model performance and accuracy for personalised prognostics. Funding: None. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Predicting mortality among patients with COVID-19 who present with a spectrum of complications is very difficult, hindering the prognostication and management of the disease. We aimed to develop an accurate prediction model of COVID-19 mortality using unbiased computational methods, and identify the clinical features most predictive of this outcome. Methods: In this prediction model development and validation study, we applied machine learning techniques to clinical data from a large cohort of patients with COVID-19 treated at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, NY, USA, to predict mortality. We analysed patient-level data captured in the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse database for individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who had a health system encounter between March 9 and April 6, 2020. For initial analyses, we used patient data from March 9 to April 5, and randomly assigned (80:20) the patients to the development dataset or test dataset 1 (retrospective). Patient data for those with encounters on April 6, 2020, were used in test dataset 2 (prospective). We designed prediction models based on clinical features and patient characteristics during health system encounters to predict mortality using the development dataset. We assessed the resultant models in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score in the test datasets. Findings: Using the development dataset (n=3841) and a systematic machine learning framework, we developed a COVID-19 mortality prediction model that showed high accuracy (AUC=0·91) when applied to test datasets of retrospective (n=961) and prospective (n=249) patients. This model was based on three clinical features: patient's age, minimum oxygen saturation over the course of their medical encounter, and type of patient encounter (inpatient vs outpatient and telehealth visits). Interpretation: An accurate and parsimonious COVID-19 mortality prediction model based on three features might have utility in clinical settings to guide the management and prognostication of patients affected by this disease. External validation of this prediction model in other populations is needed. Funding: National Institutes of Health. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

If these tools could be sustainably delivered at scale, they might have the potential to provide everyone, everywhere, with equitable access to expert-level care, narrowing the global health and wellbeing gap. Conversely, it is highly possible that these transformative technologies could exacerbate existing health-care inequalities instead. In this Viewpoint, we describe the problem of health data poverty: the inability for individuals, groups, or populations to benefit from a discovery or innovation due to a scarcity of data that are adequately representative. We assert that health data poverty is a threat to global health that could prevent the benefits of data-driven digital health technologies from being more widely realised and might even lead to them causing harm. We argue that the time to act is now to avoid creating a digital health divide that exacerbates existing health-care inequalities and to ensure that no one is left behind in the digital era. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, the ethical and legal boundaries of deploying digital tools for disease surveillance and control purposes are unclear, and a rapidly evolving debate has emerged globally around the promises and risks of mobilising digital tools for public health. To help scientists and policy makers to navigate technological and ethical uncertainty, we present a typology of the primary digital public health applications that are in use. These include proximity and contact tracing, symptom monitoring, quarantine control, and flow modelling. For each, we discuss context-specific risks, cross-sectional issues, and ethical concerns. Finally, recognising the need for practical guidance, we propose a navigation aid for policy makers and other decision makers for the ethical development and use of digital public health tools. © 2020 The Author(s).

We report here on a blinded clinical validation study and deployment of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm in a pathology laboratory for routine clinical use to aid prostate diagnosis. Methods: An AI-based algorithm was developed using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides of prostate CNBs digitised with a Philips scanner, which were divided into training (1 357 480 image patches from 549 H&E-stained slides) and internal test (2501 H&E-stained slides) datasets. The algorithm provided slide-level scores for probability of cancer, Gleason score 7–10 (vs Gleason score 6 or atypical small acinar proliferation [ASAP]), Gleason pattern 5, and perineural invasion and calculation of cancer percentage present in CNB material. The algorithm was subsequently validated on an external dataset of 100 consecutive cases (1627 H&E-stained slides) digitised on an Aperio AT2 scanner. In addition, the AI tool was implemented in a pathology laboratory within routine clinical workflow as a second read system to review all prostate CNBs. Algorithm performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity, and sensitivity, as well as Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) for cancer percentage. Findings: The algorithm achieved an AUC of 0·997 (95% CI 0·995 to 0·998) for cancer detection in the internal test set and 0·991 (0·979 to 1·00) in the external validation set. The AUC for distinguishing between a low-grade (Gleason score 6 or ASAP) and high-grade (Gleason score 7–10) cancer diagnosis was 0·941 (0·905 to 0·977) and the AUC for detecting Gleason pattern 5 was 0·971 (0·943 to 0·998) in the external validation set. Cancer percentage calculated by pathologists and the algorithm showed good agreement (r=0·882, 95% CI 0·834 to 0·915; p<0·0001) with a mean bias of −4·14% (−6·36 to −1·91). The algorithm achieved an AUC of 0·957 (0·930 to 0·985) for perineural invasion. In routine practice, the algorithm was used to assess 11 429 H&E-stained slides pertaining to 941 cases leading to 90 Gleason score 7–10 alerts and 560 cancer alerts. 51 (9%) cancer alerts led to additional cuts or stains being ordered, two (4%) of which led to a third opinion request. We report on the first case of missed cancer that was detected by the algorithm. Interpretation: This study reports the successful development, external clinical validation, and deployment in clinical practice of an AI-based algorithm to accurately detect, grade, and evaluate clinically relevant findings in digitised slides of prostate CNBs.

Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks. Methods: In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time. Findings: We collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35–60). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0·0009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5·2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020. Interpretation: News reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in image analysis, but the networks' potential for pancreatic cancer detection and diagnosis is unclear. We aimed to investigate whether CNN could distinguish individuals with and without pancreatic cancer on CT, compared with radiologist interpretation. Methods: In this retrospective, diagnostic study, contrast-enhanced CT images of 370 patients with pancreatic cancer and 320 controls from a Taiwanese centre were manually labelled and randomly divided for training and validation (295 patients with pancreatic cancer and 256 controls) and testing (75 patients with pancreatic cancer and 64 controls; local test set 1). Images were preprocessed into patches, and a CNN was trained to classify patches as cancerous or non-cancerous. Individuals were classified as with or without pancreatic cancer on the basis of the proportion of patches diagnosed as cancerous by the CNN, using a cutoff determined using the training and validation set. The CNN was further tested with another local test set (101 patients with pancreatic cancers and 88 controls; local test set 2) and a US dataset (281 pancreatic cancers and 82 controls). Radiologist reports of pancreatic cancer images in the local test sets were retrieved for comparison. Findings: Between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2018, we obtained CT images. In local test set 1, CNN-based analysis had a sensitivity of 0·973, specificity of 1·000, and accuracy of 0·986 (area under the curve [AUC] 0·997 (95% CI 0·992–1·000). In local test set 2, CNN-based analysis had a sensitivity of 0·990, specificity of 0·989, and accuracy of 0·989 (AUC 0·999 [0·998–1·000]). In the US test set, CNN-based analysis had a sensitivity of 0·790, specificity of 0·976, and accuracy of 0·832 (AUC 0·920 [0·891–0·948)]. CNN-based analysis achieved higher sensitivity than radiologists did (0·983 vs 0·929, difference 0·054 [95% CI 0·011–0·098]; p=0·014) in the two local test sets combined. CNN missed three (1·7%) of 176 pancreatic cancers (1·1–1·2 cm). Radiologists missed 12 (7%) of 168 pancreatic cancers (1·0–3·3 cm), of which 11 (92%) were correctly classified using CNN. The sensitivity of CNN for tumours smaller than 2 cm was 92·1% in the local test sets and 63·1% in the US test set. Interpretation: CNN could accurately distinguish pancreatic cancer on CT, with acceptable generalisability to images of patients from various races and ethnicities. CNN could supplement radiologist interpretation. Funding: Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for diagnosis of breast cancer in mammography, and explore whether it could benefit radiologists by improving accuracy of diagnosis. Methods: In this retrospective study, an AI algorithm was developed and validated with 170 230 mammography examinations collected from five institutions in South Korea, the USA, and the UK, including 36 468 cancer positive confirmed by biopsy, 59 544 benign confirmed by biopsy (8827 mammograms) or follow-up imaging (50 717 mammograms), and 74 218 normal. For the multicentre, observer-blinded, reader study, 320 mammograms (160 cancer positive, 64 benign, 96 normal) were independently obtained from two institutions. 14 radiologists participated as readers and assessed each mammogram in terms of likelihood of malignancy (LOM), location of malignancy, and necessity to recall the patient, first without and then with assistance of the AI algorithm. The performance of AI and radiologists was evaluated in terms of LOM-based area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and recall-based sensitivity and specificity. Findings: The AI standalone performance was AUROC 0·959 (95% CI 0·952–0·966) overall, and 0·970 (0·963–0·978) in the South Korea dataset, 0·953 (0·938–0·968) in the USA dataset, and 0·938 (0·918–0·958) in the UK dataset. In the reader study, the performance level of AI was 0·940 (0·915–0·965), significantly higher than that of the radiologists without AI assistance (0·810, 95% CI 0·770–0·850; p<0·0001). With the assistance of AI, radiologists' performance was improved to 0·881 (0·850–0·911; p<0·0001). AI was more sensitive to detect cancers with mass (53 [90%] vs 46 [78%] of 59 cancers detected; p=0·044) or distortion or asymmetry (18 [90%] vs ten [50%] of 20 cancers detected; p=0·023) than radiologists. AI was better in detection of T1 cancers (73 [91%] vs 59 [74%] of 80; p=0·0039) or node-negative cancers (104 [87%] vs 88 [74%] of 119; p=0·0025) than radiologists. Interpretation: The AI algorithm developed with large-scale mammography data showed better diagnostic performance in breast cancer detection compared with radiologists.

The aim of the study was to evaluate whether this clinical benefit seen for the RPM group during the initial 12 month follow-up of the TIM-HF2 trial would be sustained 1 year after stopping the RPM intervention. Methods: TIM-HF2 was a prospective, randomised, multicentre trial done in 43 hospitals, 60 cardiology practices, and 87 general practitioners in Germany. Patients with heart failure, New York Heart Association functional class II or III, and who had been hospitalised for heart failure within 12 months before randomisation were randomly assigned to either the RPM intervention or usual care. At the final study visit (main trial), the RPM intervention was stopped and the 1 year extended follow-up period started, which lasted 1 year. The primary outcome was percentage of days lost due to unplanned cardiovascular hospitalisations and all-cause mortality. Analyses were done using the intention-to-treat principle. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01878630. Findings: Between Aug 13, 2013, and May 12, 2017, 1538 patients were enrolled (765 to the remote patient management group and 773 to the usual care group) in the main trial. 671 of 765 patients in the remote patient management group and 673 of 773 in the usual care group completed the main trial and started the extended follow-up period up to 1 year later. In the extended follow-up period, the percentage of days lost due to unplanned cardiovascular hospital admissions and all-cause mortality did not differ significantly between groups weighted mean 5·95% [95% CI 4·59–7·31] in the RPM group vs 6·64% [95% CI 5·19–8·08] in the usual care group [rate ratio 0·79; 95% CI 0·78–1·21]). However, when data from the main trial and the extended follow-up period were combined, the percentage of days lost due to unplanned cardiovascular hospitalisation or all-cause death was significantly less in patients allocated to the RPM group (382 [50%] of 765; weighted mean 9·28%; 95% CI 7·76–10·81) than in the UC group (398 [51%] of 773; 11·78%; 95% CI 10·08–13·49; ratio of weighted average 0·79; 95% CI 0·62–1·00; p=0·0486). Interpretation: The positive effect of our RPM intervention on morbidity and mortality over the course of the main trial was no longer observed 1 year after stopping the RPM intervention. However, because the TIM-HF2 trial was not powered to show significance during the extended follow-up period, our results are exploratory and require further research.

Consequently, we aimed to evaluate if population trends of seasonal respiratory infections, such as influenza, could be identified through wearable sensors that collect RHR and sleep data. Methods: We obtained de-identified sensor data from 200 000 individuals who used a Fitbit wearable device from March 1, 2016, to March 1, 2018, in the USA. We included users who wore a Fitbit for at least 60 days and used the same wearable throughout the entire period, and focused on the top five states with the most Fitbit users in the dataset: California, Texas, New York, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. Inclusion criteria included having a self-reported birth year between 1930 and 2004, height greater than 1 m, and weight greater than 20 kg. We excluded daily measurements with missing RHR, missing wear time, and wear time less than 1000 min per day. We compared sensor data with weekly estimates of influenza-like illness (ILI) rates at the state level, as reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), by identifying weeks in which Fitbit users displayed elevated RHRs and increased sleep levels. For each state, we modelled ILI case counts with a negative binomial model that included 3-week lagged CDC ILI rate data (null model) and the proportion of weekly Fitbit users with elevated RHR and increased sleep duration above a specified threshold (full model). We also evaluated weekly change in ILI rate by linear regression using change in proportion of elevated Fitbit data. Pearson correlation was used to compare predicted versus CDC reported ILI rates. Findings: We identified 47 249 users in the top five states who wore a Fitbit consistently during the study period, including more than 13·3 million total RHR and sleep measures. We found the Fitbit data significantly improved ILI predictions in all five states, with an average increase in Pearson correlation of 0·12 (SD 0·07) over baseline models, corresponding to an improvement of 6·3–32·9%. Correlations of the final models with the CDC ILI rates ranged from 0·84 to 0·97. Week-to-week changes in the proportion of Fitbit users with abnormal data were associated with week-to-week changes in ILI rates in most cases. Interpretation: Activity and physiological trackers are increasingly used in the USA and globally to monitor individual health. By accessing these data, it could be possible to improve real-time and geographically refined influenza surveillance. This information could be vital to enact timely outbreak response measures to prevent further transmission of influenza cases during outbreaks.

However, its conventional use requires expert clinical interpretation and does not provide detailed quantitative outputs, which may have prognostic importance. We aimed to use deep learning to reliably and efficiently quantify and detect different lesion types. Methods: Patients were recruited between Dec 9, 2014, and Dec 17, 2017, in 60 centres across Europe. We trained and validated an initial convolutional neural network (CNN) on expert manual segmentations (dataset 1). This CNN was used to automatically segment a new dataset of scans, which we then corrected manually (dataset 2). From this dataset, we used a subset of scans to train a final CNN for multiclass, voxel-wise segmentation of lesion types. The performance of this CNN was evaluated on a test subset. Performance was measured for lesion volume quantification, lesion progression, and lesion detection and lesion volume classification. For lesion detection, external validation was done on an independent set of 500 patients from India. Findings: 98 scans from one centre were included in dataset 1. Dataset 2 comprised 839 scans from 38 centres: 184 scans were used in the training subset and 655 in the test subset. Compared with manual reference, CNN-derived lesion volumes showed a mean difference of 0·86 mL (95% CI −5·23 to 6·94) for intraparenchymal haemorrhage, 1·83 mL (−12·01 to 15·66) for extra-axial haemorrhage, 2·09 mL (−9·38 to 13·56) for perilesional oedema, and 0·07 mL (−1·00 to 1·13) for intraventricular haemorrhage. Interpretation: We show the ability of a CNN to separately segment, quantify, and detect multiclass haemorrhagic lesions and perilesional oedema. These volumetric lesion estimates allow clinically relevant quantification of lesion burden and progression, with potential applications for personalised treatment strategies and clinical research in TBI.

Thoracic CT scans are widely used for diagnostic and screening purposes for lung cancer. In this proof-of-concept study, we aimed to evaluate a software pipeline for the automated detection of COPD, based on deep learning and a dataset of low-dose CTs that were performed for early detection of lung cancer. Methods: We examined the use of deep residual networks, a type of artificial residual network, for the automated detection of COPD. Three versions of the residual networks were independently trained to perform COPD diagnosis using random subsets of CT scans collected from the PanCan study, which enrolled ex-smokers and current smokers at high risk of lung cancer, and evaluated the networks using three-fold cross-validation experiments. External validation was performed using 2153 CT scans acquired from a separate cohort of individuals with COPD in the ECLIPSE study. Spirometric data were used to define COPD, with stages defined according to the GOLD criteria. Findings: The best performing networks achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0·889 (SD 0·017) in three-fold cross-validation experiments. When the same set of networks was applied to the ECLIPSE cohort without any modifications to the trained models, they achieved an AUC of 0·886 (0·017), a positive predictive value of 0·847 (0·056), and a negative predictive value of 0·755 (0·097), which is a greater performance than the best quantitative CT measure, the percentage of lung volumes of less than or equal to −950 Hounsfield units (AUC 0·742). Interpretation: Our proposed approach could identify patients with COPD among ex-smokers and current smokers without a previous diagnosis of COPD, with clinically acceptable performance. The use of deep residual networks on chest CT scans could be an effective case-finding tool for COPD detection and diagnosis, particularly in ex-smokers and current smokers who are being screened for lung cancer.

The healthy ageing through internet counselling in the elderly (HATICE) trial aimed to determine whether a coach-supported internet intervention for self-management can reduce cardiovascular risk in community-dwelling older people. Methods: This prospective open-label, blinded endpoint clinical trial among people age 65 years or over at increased risk of cardiovascular disease randomly assigned participants in the Netherlands, Finland, and France to an interactive internet intervention stimulating coach-supported self-management or a control platform. Primary outcome was the difference from baseline to 18 months on a standardised composite score (Z score) of systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and body-mass index (BMI). Secondary outcomes included individual risk factors and cardiovascular endpoints. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 48151589, and is closed to accrual. Findings: Among 2724 participants, complete primary outcome data were available for 2398 (88%). After 18 months, the primary outcome improved in the intervention group versus the control group (0·09 vs 0·04, respectively; mean difference −0·05, 95% CI −0·08 to −0·01; p=0·008). For individual components of the primary outcome, mean differences (intervention vs control) were systolic blood pressure −1·79 mm Hg versus −0·67 mm Hg (−1·12, −2·51 to 0·27); BMI −0·23 kg/m2 versus −0·08 kg/m2 (−0·15, −0·28 to −0·01); and LDL −0·12 mmol/L versus −0·07 mmol/L (−0·05, −0·11 to 0·01). Cardiovascular disease occurred in 30 (2·2%) of 1382 patients in the intervention versus 32 (2·4%) of 1333 patients in the control group (hazard ratio 0·86, 95% CI 0·52 to 1·43). Interpretation: Coach-supported self-management of cardiovascular risk factors using an interactive internet intervention is feasible in an older population, and leads to a modest improvement of cardiovascular risk profile. When implemented on a large scale this could potentially reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease. Funding: European Commission Seventh Framework Programme. © 2019 The Author(s).

Alternatives to traditional care, including novel digital therapeutics, have shown promise to remediate cognitive deficits associated with this disorder and may address barriers to standard therapies, such as pharmacological interventions and behavioural therapy. AKL-T01 is an investigational digital therapeutic designed to target attention and cognitive control delivered through a video game-like interface via at-home play for 25 min per day, 5 days per week for 4 weeks. This study aimed to assess whether AKL-T01 improved attentional performance in paediatric patients with ADHD. Methods: The Software Treatment for Actively Reducing Severity of ADHD (STARS-ADHD) was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trial of paediatric patients (aged 8–12 years, without disorder-related medications) with confirmed ADHD and Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) Attention Performance Index (API) scores of −1·8 and below done by 20 research institutions in the USA. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to AKL-T01 or a digital control intervention. The primary outcome was mean change in TOVA API from pre-intervention to post-intervention. Safety, tolerability, and compliance were also assessed. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02674633 and is completed. Findings: Between July 15, 2016, and Nov 30, 2017, 857 patients were evaluated and 348 were randomly assigned to receive AKL-T01 or control. Among patients who received AKL-T01 (n=180 [52%]; mean [SD] age, 9·7 [1·3] years) or control (n=168 [48%]; mean [SD] age, 9·6 [1·3] years), the non-parametric estimate of the population median change from baseline TOVA API was 0·88 (95% CI 0·24–1·49; p=0·0060). The mean (SD) change from baseline on the TOVA API was 0·93 (3·15) in the AKL-T01 group and 0·03 (3·16) in the control group. There were no serious adverse events or discontinuations. Treatment-related adverse events were mild and included frustration (5 [3%] of 180) and headache (3 [2%] of 180). Patient compliance was a mean of 83 (83%) of 100 expected sessions played (SD, 29·2 sessions). Interpretation: Although future research is needed for this digital intervention, this study provides evidence that AKL-T01 might be used to improve objectively measured inattention in paediatric patients with ADHD, while presenting minimal adverse events.

We aimed to assess whether the number and type of medication errors changed as an electronic prescribing system was optimised over time in a UK hospital. Methods: We did a prospective observational study at a tertiary-care teaching hospital. Eight senior clinical pharmacists reviewed patients' records and collected data across four adult wards (renal, cardiology, general medical, and orthopaedic surgical) over a 2-year period (from Sept 29, 2014, to June 9, 2016). All medication errors and potential and actual adverse drug events were documented and the number of medication errors measured over the course of four time periods 7–10 weeks long. Pharmacists also recorded instances where the electronic prescribing system contributed to an error (system-related errors). A negative-binomial model and a Poisson model were used to identify factors related to medication error rates. Findings: 5796 primary errors were recorded over the four time periods (period 1, 47 days [Sep 29–Dec 2, 2014]; period 2, 38 days [April 20–June 12, 2015, for the renal, medical, and surgical wards and April 20–June 15, 2015, for the cardiology ward]; period 3, 35 days [Sep 28–Nov 27, 2015] for the renal ward, 37 days [Sep 28–Nov 23, 2015] for the medical ward, and 40 days [Sep 28–Nov 20, 2015] for the cardiology and surgical wards; and period 4, 37 days [Feb 22–April 15, 2015] for the renal and medical wards and 39 days for the cardiology [April 13–June 7, 2015] and surgery [April 18–June 9, 2015] wards; unanticipated organisational factors prevented data collection on some days during each time period). There was no change in the rate of primary medication errors per admission over the observation periods: 1·53 medication errors in period 1, 1·44 medication errors in period 2, 1·70 medication errors in period 3, and 1·43 medication errors in period 4, per admission. By contrast, the overall rate of different types of medication errors decreased over the four periods. The most common types of error were medicine-reconciliation, dose, and avoidable delay-of-treatment errors. Some types of errors appeared to reduce over time (eg, dose errors [from 52 errors in period 1 to 19 errors in period 4, per 100 admissions]), whereas others increased (eg, inadequate follow-up of therapy [from 12 errors in period 1 to 24 errors in period 4, per 100 admissions]). We also found a reduction in the rates of potential adverse drug events between the first three periods and period 4. 436 system-related errors were recorded over the study period. Interpretation: Although the overall rates of primary medication errors per admission did not change, we found a reduction in some error types and a significant decrease in the rates of potential adverse drug events over a 2-year period, during which system optimisation occurred. Targeting some error types could have the added benefit of reducing others, which suggests that system optimisation could ultimately help improve patient safety and outcomes.

We aimed to use machine learning techniques to develop and externally validate a simple risk prediction panel to screen individuals for Barrett's oesophagus. Methods: In this prospective study, machine learning risk prediction in Barrett's oesophagus (MARK-BE), we used data from two case-control studies, BEST2 and BOOST, to compile training and validation datasets. From the BEST2 study, we analysed questionnaires from 1299 patients, of whom 880 (67·7%) had Barrett's oesophagus, including 40 with invasive oesophageal adenocarcinoma, and 419 (32·3%) were controls. We randomly split (6:4) the cohort using a computer algorithm into a training dataset of 776 patients and a testing dataset of 523 patients. We compiled an external validation cohort from the BOOST study, which included 398 patients, comprising 198 patients with Barrett's oesophagus (23 with oesophageal adenocarcinoma) and 200 controls. We identified independently important diagnostic features of Barrett's oesophagus using the machine learning techniques information gain and correlation-based feature selection. We assessed multiple classification tools to create a multivariable risk prediction model. Internal validation of the model using the BEST2 testing dataset was followed by external validation using the BOOST external validation dataset. From these data we created a prediction panel to identify at-risk individuals. Findings: The BEST2 study included 40 diagnostic features. Of these, 19 added information gain but after correlation-based feature selection only eight showed independent diagnostic value including age, sex, cigarette smoking, waist circumference, frequency of stomach pain, duration of heartburn and acidic taste, and taking antireflux medication, of which all were associated with increased risk of Barrett's oesophagus, except frequency of stomach pain, with was inversely associated in a case-control population. Logistic regression offered the highest prediction quality with an area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) of 0·87 (95% CI 0·84–0·90; sensitivity set at 90%; specificity of 68%). In the testing dataset, AUC was 0·86 (0·83–0·89; sensitivity set at 90%; specificity of 65%). In the external validation dataset, the AUC was 0·81 (0·74–0·84; sensitivity set at 90%; specificity of 58%). Interpretation: Our diagnostic model offers valid predictions of diagnosis of Barrett's oesophagus in patients with symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, assisting in identifying who should go forward to invasive confirmatory testing. Our predictive panel suggests that overweight men who have been taking antireflux medication for a long time might merit particular consideration for further testing. Our risk prediction panel is quick and simple to administer but will need further calibration and validation in a prospective study in primary care.

We investigated whether machine learning methods using analyses of time-series data improved mortality prognostication for patients in the ICU by providing real-time predictions of 90-day mortality. In addition, we examined to what extent such a dynamic model could be made interpretable by quantifying and visualising the features that drive the predictions at different timepoints. Methods: Based on the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) III variables, we trained a machine learning model on longitudinal data from patients admitted to four ICUs in the Capital Region, Denmark, between 2011 and 2016. We included all patients older than 16 years of age, with an ICU stay lasting more than 1 h, and who had a Danish civil registration number to enable 90-day follow-up. We leveraged static data and physiological time-series data from electronic health records and the Danish National Patient Registry. A recurrent neural network was trained with a temporal resolution of 1 h. The model was internally validated using the holdout method with 20% of the training dataset and externally validated using previously unseen data from a fifth hospital in Denmark. Its performance was assessed with the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) as metrics, using bootstrapping with 1000 samples with replacement to construct 95% CIs. A Shapley additive explanations algorithm was applied to the prediction model to obtain explanations of the features that drive patient-specific predictions, and the contributions of each of the 44 features in the model were analysed and compared with the variables in the original SAPS III model. Findings: From a dataset containing 15 615 ICU admissions of 12 616 patients, we included 14 190 admissions of 11 492 patients in our analysis. Overall, 90-day mortality was 33·1% (3802 patients). The deep learning model showed a predictive performance on the holdout testing dataset that improved over the timecourse of an ICU stay: MCC 0·29 (95% CI 0·25–0·33) and AUROC 0·73 (0·71–0·74) at admission, 0·43 (0·40–0·47) and 0·82 (0·80–0·84) after 24 h, 0·50 (0·46–0·53) and 0·85 (0·84–0·87) after 72 h, and 0·57 (0·54–0·60) and 0·88 (0·87–0·89) at the time of discharge. The model exhibited good calibration properties. These results were validated in an external validation cohort of 5827 patients with 6748 admissions: MCC 0·29 (95% CI 0·27–0·32) and AUROC 0·75 (0·73–0·76) at admission, 0·41 (0·39–0·44) and 0·80 (0·79–0·81) after 24 h, 0·46 (0·43–0·48) and 0·82 (0·81–0·83) after 72 h, and 0·47 (0·44–0·49) and 0·83 (0·82–0·84) at the time of discharge. Interpretation: The prediction of 90-day mortality improved with 1-h sampling intervals during the ICU stay. The dynamic risk prediction can also be explained for an individual patient, visualising the features contributing to the prediction at any point in time. This explanation allows the clinician to determine whether there are elements in the current patient state and care that are potentially actionable, thus making the model suitable for further validation as a clinical tool.

We used a cost-minimisation analysis to evaluate the potential savings of two deep learning approaches as compared with the current human assessment: a semi-automated deep learning model as a triage filter before secondary human assessment; and a fully automated deep learning model without human assessment. Methods: In this economic analysis modelling study, using 39 006 consecutive patients with diabetes in a national diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Singapore in 2015, we used a decision tree model and TreeAge Pro to compare the actual cost of screening this cohort with human graders against the simulated cost for semi-automated and fully automated screening models. Model parameters included diabetic retinopathy prevalence rates, diabetic retinopathy screening costs under each screening model, cost of medical consultation, and diagnostic performance (ie, sensitivity and specificity). The primary outcome was total cost for each screening model. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were done to gauge the sensitivity of the results to key model assumptions. Findings: From the health system perspective, the semi-automated screening model was the least expensive of the three models, at US$62 per patient per year. The fully automated model was $66 per patient per year, and the human assessment model was $77 per patient per year. The savings to the Singapore health system associated with switching to the semi-automated model are estimated to be $489 000, which is roughly 20% of the current annual screening cost. By 2050, Singapore is projected to have 1 million people with diabetes; at this time, the estimated annual savings would be $15 million. Interpretation: This study provides a strong economic rationale for using deep learning systems as an assistive tool to screen for diabetic retinopathy.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a combined online universal (ie, delivered to all pupils) school-based preventive intervention targeting substance use, depression, and anxiety in adolescence. Methods: We did a multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial in secondary schools in Australia, with pupils in year 8 or 9 (aged 13–14 years). Participating schools were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to one of four intervention conditions: (1) Climate Schools–Substance Use, focusing on substance use only; (2) Climate Schools–Mental Health, focusing on depression and anxiety only; (3) Climate Schools–Combined, focusing on the prevention of substance use, depression, and anxiety; or (4) active control. The interventions were delivered in school classrooms in an online delivery format and used a mixture of peer cartoon storyboards and classroom activities that were focused on alcohol, cannabis, anxiety, and depression. The interventions were delivered for 2 years and primary outcomes were knowledge related to alcohol, cannabis, and mental health; alcohol use, including heavy episodic drinking; and depression and anxiety symptoms at 12, 24, and 30 months after baseline. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12613000723785) and an extended follow-up is underway. Findings: Between Sept 1, 2013, and Feb 28, 2014, we recruited 88 schools (12 391 pupils), of whom 71 schools and 6386 (51·5%) pupils were analysed (17 schools dropped out and 1308 pupils declined to participate). We allocated 18 schools (1739 [27·25%] pupils; 1690 [97·2%] completed at least one follow-up) to the substance use condition, 18 schools (1594 [25·0%] pupils; 1560 [97·9%] completed at least one follow-up) to the mental health condition, 16 schools (1497 [23·4%] pupils; 1443 [96·4%] completed at least one follow-up) to the combined condition, and 19 schools (1556 [23·4%] pupils; 1513 [97·2%] completed at least one follow-up) to the control condition. Compared with controls, the combined intervention group had increased knowledge related to alcohol and cannabis at 12, 24, and 30 months (standardised mean difference [SMD] for alcohol 0·26 [95% CI 0·14 to 0·39] and for cannabis 0·17 [0·06 to 0·28] at 30 months), increased knowledge related to mental health at 24 months (0·17 [0·08 to 0·27]), reduced growth in their odds of drinking and heavy episodic drinking at 12, 24, and 30 months (odds ratio for drinking 0·25 [95% CI 0·12 to 0·51], and for heavy episodic drinking 0·15 [0·04 to 0·58] at 30 months), and reduced increases in anxiety symptoms at 12 and 30 months (SMD −0·12 [95% CI −0·22 to −0·01] at 30 months). We found no difference in symptoms or probable diagnosis of depression. The combined intervention group also showed improvement in alcohol use outcomes compared with the substance use and mental health interventions and improvements in anxiety outcomes when compared with the mental health intervention only. Interpretation: Combined online prevention of substance use, depression, and anxiety led to increased knowledge of alcohol, cannabis, and mental health, reduced increase in the odds of any drinking and heavy episodic drinking, and reduced symptoms of anxiety over a 30-month period. These findings provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of an online universal school-based preventive intervention targeting substance use, depression, and anxiety in adolescence.

We developed an artificial intelligence deep learning algorithm (DLA) to detect chronic kidney disease from retinal images, which could add to existing chronic kidney disease screening strategies. Methods: We used data from three population-based, multiethnic, cross-sectional studies in Singapore and China. The Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study (SEED, patients aged ≥40 years) was used to develop (5188 patients) and validate (1297 patients) the DLA. External testing was done on two independent datasets: the Singapore Prospective Study Program (SP2, 3735 patients aged ≥25 years) and the Beijing Eye Study (BES, 1538 patients aged ≥40 years). Chronic kidney disease was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min per 1·73m2. Three models were trained: 1) image DLA; 2) risk factors (RF) including age, sex, ethnicity, diabetes, and hypertension; and 3) hybrid DLA combining image and RF. Model performances were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Findings: In the SEED validation dataset, the AUC was 0·911 for image DLA (95% CI 0·886 −0·936), 0·916 for RF (0·891–0·941), and 0·938 for hybrid DLA (0·917–0·959). Corresponding estimates in the SP2 testing dataset were 0·733 for image DLA (95% CI 0·696–0·770), 0·829 for RF (0·797–0·861), and 0·810 for hybrid DLA (0·776–0·844); and in the BES testing dataset estimates were 0·835 for image DLA (0·767–0·903), 0·887 for RF (0·828–0·946), and 0·858 for hybrid DLA (0·794–0·922). AUC estimates were similar in subgroups of people with diabetes (image DLA 0·889 [95% CI 0·850–0·928], RF 0·899 [0·862–0·936], hybrid 0·925 [0·893–0·957]) and hypertension (image DLA 0·889 [95% CI 0·860–0·918], RF 0·889 [0·860–0·918], hybrid 0·918 [0·893–0·943]). Interpretation: A retinal image DLA shows good performance for estimating chronic kidney disease, underlying the feasibility of using retinal photography as an adjunctive or opportunistic screening tool for chronic kidney disease in community populations.

We report the first-in-human evaluation of real-time phenoxymethylpenicillin monitoring using a minimally invasive microneedle-based β-lactam biosensor in healthy volunteers. Methods: This first-in-human, proof-of-concept study was done at the National Institute of Health Research/Wellcome Trust Imperial Clinical Research Facility (Imperial College London, London, UK). The study was approved by London-Harrow Regional Ethics Committee. Volunteers were identified through emails sent to a healthy volunteer database from the Imperial College Clinical Research Facility. Volunteers, who had to be older than 18 years, were excluded if they had evidence of active infection, allergies to penicillin, were at high risk of skin infection, or presented with anaemia during screening. Participants wore a solid microneedle β-lactam biosensor for up to 6 h while being dosed at steady state with oral phenoxymethylpenicillin (five 500 mg doses every 6 h). On arrival at the study centre, two microneedle sensors were applied to the participant's forearm. Blood samples (via cannula, at −30, 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240 min) and extracellular fluid (ECF; via microdialysis, every 15 min) pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were taken during one dosing interval. Phenoxymethylpenicillin concentration data obtained from the microneedles were calibrated using locally estimated scatter plot smoothing and compared with free-blood and microdialysis (gold standard) data. Phenoxymethylpenicillin PK for each method was evaluated using non-compartmental analysis. Area under the concentration–time curve (AUC), maximum concentration, and time to maximum concentration were compared. Bias and limits of agreement were investigated with Bland–Altman plots. Microneedle biosensor limits of detection were estimated. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03847610. Findings: Ten healthy volunteers participated in the study. Mean age was 42 years (SD 14). Seven (70%) were men. Microdialysis and microneedle results were similar for phenoxymethylpenicillin ECF maximum concentration (0·74 mg/L vs 0·64 mg/L; 95% CI −0·24 to 0·44; p=0·53), time to maximum concentration (1·18 h vs 1·10 h; −0·52 to 0·67; p=0·79), and AUC (1·54 mg × h/L vs 1·67 mg × h/L; −1·10 to 0·85; p=0·79). In total, 440 time points were compared with mean difference between measurements −0·16 mg/L (95% CI −1·30 to 0·82). Mean phenoxymethylpenicillin AUCs for free serum and microneedle PK were similar (1·77 mg × h/L [SD 0·59] vs 1·67 mg × h/L [1·00]; −0·77 to 0·97; p=0·81). Median coefficient of variation between sensors within individuals was 7% (IQR 4–17). Limit of detection for the microneedles was estimated at 0·17 mg/L. Interpretation: This study is proof-of-concept of real-time, microneedle sensing of penicillin in vivo. Future work will explore microneedle use in patient populations, their role in data generation to inform dosing recommendations, and their incorporation into closed-loop control systems for automated drug delivery.

We aimed to develop and validate a quantitative radiomic risk score (QuRiS) and associated nomogram (QuRNom) for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is prognostic of disease-free survival and predictive of the added benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery. Methods: We did a retrospective multicohort study of individuals with early-stage NSCLC (stage I and II) who either received surgery alone or surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy. We selected patients for whom we had available pre-treatment diagnostic CT scans and corresponding survival information. We used radiomic texture features derived from within and outside the primary lung nodule on chest CT scans of patients from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (Cleveland, OH, USA; cohort D1) to develop QuRiS. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-Cox regularisation model was used for data dimension reduction, feature selection, and QuRiS construction. QuRiS was independently validated on a cohort of patients from the University of Pennsylvania (Philadephia, PA, USA; cohort D2) and a cohort of patients whose CT scans were derived from The Cancer Imaging Archive (cohort D3). QuRNom was constructed by integrating QuRiS with tumour and node descriptors (according to the tumour, node, metastasis staging system) and lymphovascular invasion. The primary endpoint of the study was the assessment of the performance of QuRiS and QuRNom in predicting disease-free survival. The added benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy estimated using QuRiS and QuRNom was validated by comparing patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy versus patients who underwent surgery alone in cohorts D1–D3. Findings: We included: 329 patients in cohort D1 (73 [22%] had surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy and 256 (78%) had surgery alone); 114 patients in cohort D2 (33 [29%] had surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy and 81 (71%) had surgery alone); and 82 patients in cohort D3 (24 [29%] had surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy and 58 (71%) had surgery alone). QuRiS comprised three intratumoral and 10 peritumoral CT-radiomic features and was found to be significantly associated with disease-free survival (ie, prognostic validation of QuRiS; hazard ratio for predicted high-risk vs predicted low-risk groups 1·56, 95% CI 1·08–2·23, p=0·016 for cohort D1; 2·66, 1·24–5·68, p=0·011 for cohort D2; and 2·67, 1·39–5·11, p=0·0029 for cohort D3). To validate the predictive performance of QuRiS, patients were partitioned into three risk groups (high, intermediate, and low risk) on the basis of their corresponding QuRiS. Patients in the high-risk group were observed to have significantly longer survival with adjuvant chemotherapy than patients who underwent surgery alone (0·27, 0·08–0·95, p=0·042, for cohort D1; 0·08, 0·01–0·42, p=0·0029, for cohorts D2 and D3 combined). As concerns QuRNom, the nomogram-estimated survival benefit was predictive of the actual efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy (0·25, 0·12–0·55, p<0·0001, for cohort D1; 0·13, <0·01–0·99, p=0·0019 for cohort D3). Interpretation: QuRiS and QuRNom were validated as being prognostic of disease-free survival and predictive of the added benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy, especially in clinically defined low-risk groups. Since QuRiS is based on routine chest CT imaging, with additional multisite independent validation it could potentially be employed for decision management in non-invasive treatment of resectable lung cancer.

We aimed to compare the prognostic ability of automated CT-based body composition biomarkers derived from previously developed deep-learning and feature-based algorithms with that of clinical parameters (Framingham risk score [FRS] and body-mass index [BMI]) for predicting major cardiovascular events and overall survival in an adult screening cohort. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, mature and fully automated CT-based algorithms with predefined metrics for quantifying aortic calcification, muscle density, ratio of visceral to subcutaneous fat, liver fat, and bone mineral density were applied to a generally healthy asymptomatic outpatient cohort of adults aged 18 years or older undergoing abdominal CT for routine colorectal cancer screening. To assess the association between the predictive measures (CT-based vs FRS and BMI) and downstream adverse events (death or myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or congestive heart failure subsequent to CT scanning), we used both an event-free survival analysis and logistic regression to compute receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs). Findings: 9223 people (mean age 57·1 years [SD 7·8]; 5152 [56%] women and 4071 [44%] men) who underwent CT scans between April, 2004, and December, 2016, were included in this analysis. In the longitudinal clinical follow-up (median 8·8 years [IQR 5·1–11·6]), subsequent major cardiovascular events or death occurred in 1831 (20%) patients. Significant differences were observed for all five automated CT-based body composition measures according to adverse events (p<0·001). Univariate 5-year area under the ROC (AUROC) values for predicting death were 0·743 (95% CI 0·705–0·780) for aortic calcification, 0·721 (0·683–0·759) for muscle density, 0·661 (0·625–0·697) for ratio of visceral to subcutaneous fat, 0·619 (0·582–0·656) for liver density, and 0·646 (0·603–0·688) for vertebral density, compared with 0·499 (0·454–0·544) for BMI and 0·688 (0·650–0·727) for FRS. Univariate hazard ratios for highest-risk quartile versus others for these same CT measures were 4·53 (95% CI 3·82–5·37) for aortic calcification, 3·58 (3·02–4·23) for muscle density, 2·28 (1·92–2·71) for the ratio of visceral to subcutaneous fat, 1·82 (1·52–2·17) for liver density, and 2·73 (2·31–3·23) for vertebral density, compared with 1·36 (1·13–1·64) for BMI and 2·82 (2·36–3·37) for FRS. Multivariate combinations of CT biomarkers further improved prediction over clinical parameters (p<0·05 for AUROCs). For example, the 2-year AUROC from combining aortic calcification, muscle density, and liver density for predicting death was 0·811 (95% CI 0·761–0·860). Interpretation: Fully automated quantitative tissue biomarkers derived from CT scans can outperform established clinical parameters for presymptomatic risk stratification for future serious adverse events and add opportunistic value to CT scans performed for other indications.

We therefore aimed to engineer a deep learning approach for the automated multilabel diagnosis of heart rhythm or conduction abnormalities by real-time ECG analysis. Methods: We used a dataset of ECGs (standard 10 s, 12-channel format) from adult patients (aged ≥18 years), with 21 distinct rhythm classes, including most types of heart rhythm or conduction abnormalities, for the diagnosis of arrhythmias at multilabel level. The ECGs were collected from three campuses of Tongji Hospital (Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China) and annotated by cardiologists. We used these datasets to develop a convolutional neural network approach to generate diagnoses of arrythmias. We collected a test dataset of ECGs from a new group of patients not included in the training dataset. The test dataset was annotated by consensus of a committee of board-certified, actively practicing cardiologists. To evaluate the performance of the model we assessed the F1 score and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, as well as quantifying sensitivity and specificity. To validate our results, findings for the test dataset were compared with diagnoses made by 53 ECG physicians working in cardiology departments who had a wide range of experience in ECG interpretation (range 0 to >12 years). An external public validation dataset of 962 ECGs from other hospitals was used to study generalisability of the diagnostic model. Findings: Our training and validation dataset comprised 180 112 ECGs from 70 692 patients, collected between Jan 1, 2012, and Apr 30, 2019. The test dataset comprised 828 ECGs corresponding to 828 new patients, recorded between Sept 11, 2012, and Aug 30, 2019. At the multilabel level, our deep learning approach to diagnosing heart abnormalities resulted in an exact match in 658 (80%) of 828 ECGs, exceeding the mean performance of physicians (552 [67%] for physicians with 0–6 years of experience; 571 [69%] for physicians with 7–12 years of experience; 621 [75%] for physicians with more than 12 years of experience). Our model had an overall mean F1 score of 0·887 compared with 0·789 for physicians with 0–6 years of experience, 0·815 for physicians with 7–12 years of experience, and 0·831 for physicians with more than 12 years of experience. The model had a mean AUC ROC score of 0·983 (95% CI 0·980–0·986), sensitivity of 0·867 (0·849–0·885) and specificity of 0·995 (0·994–0·996). Promising F1 scores were also obtained from the external public database using our proposed model without any model modifications (mean F1 scores of 0·845 in multilabel and 0·852 in single-label ECGs). Interpretation: Our model is more accurate than physicians working in cardiology departments at distinguishing a range of distinct arrhythmias in single-label and multilabel ECGs, laying a promising foundation for computational decision-support systems in clinical applications.

However, non-indicated antibiotics are frequently ordered and this is an important driver of antimicrobial resistance. The mHealth Diarrhoea Management (mHDM) trial aimed to establish whether electronic decision support improves rehydration and antibiotic guideline adherence in resource-limited settings. Methods: A cluster randomised controlled trial was done at ten district hospitals in Bangladesh. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 2 months or older with uncomplicated acute diarrhoea. Admission orders were observed without intervention in the pre-intervention period, followed by randomisation to electronic (rehydration calculator) or paper formatted WHO guidelines for the intervention period. The primary outcome was rate of intravenous fluid ordered as a binary variable. Generalised linear mixed-effect models, accounting for hospital clustering, served as the analytical framework; the analysis was intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03154229) and is completed. Findings: From March 11 to Sept 10, 2018, 4975 patients (75·6%) of 6577 screened patients were enrolled. The intervention effect for the primary outcome showed no significant differences in rates of intravenous fluids ordered as a function of decision-support type. Intravenous fluid orders decreased by 0·9 percentage points for paper electronic decision support and 4·2 percentage points for electronic decision support, with a 4·2-point difference between decision-support types in the intervention period (paper 98·7% [95% CI 91·8–99·8] vs electronic 94·5% [72·2–99·1]; pinteraction=0·31). Adverse events such as complications and mortality events were uncommon and could not be statistically estimated. Interpretation: Although intravenous fluid orders did not change, electronic decision support was associated with increases in the volume of intravenous fluid ordered and decreases in antibiotics ordered, which are consistent with WHO guidelines.

We aimed to establish an effective screening strategy in Shanghai, China, to aid early identification of patients with COVID-19. Methods: We did a multicentre, observational cohort study in fever clinics of 25 hospitals in 16 districts of Shanghai. All patients visiting the clinics within the study period were included. A strategy for COVID-19 screening was presented and then suspected cases were monitored and analysed until they were confirmed as cases or excluded. Logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors of COVID-19. Findings: We enrolled patients visiting fever clinics from Jan 17 to Feb 16, 2020. Among 53 617 patients visiting fever clinics, 1004 (1·9%) were considered as suspected cases, with 188 (0·4% of all patients, 18·7% of suspected cases) eventually diagnosed as confirmed cases. 154 patients with missing data were excluded from the analysis. Exposure history (odds ratio [OR] 4·16, 95% CI 2·74–6·33; p<0·0001), fatigue (OR 1·56, 1·01–2·41; p=0·043), white blood cell count less than 4 × 109 per L (OR 2·44, 1·28–4·64; p=0·0066), lymphocyte count less than 0·8 × 109 per L (OR 1·82, 1·00–3·31; p=0·049), ground glass opacity (OR 1·95, 1·32–2·89; p=0·0009), and having both lungs affected (OR 1·54, 1·04–2·28; p=0·032) were independent risk factors for confirmed COVID-19. Interpretation: The screening strategy was effective for confirming or excluding COVID-19 during the spread of this contagious disease. Relevant independent risk factors identified in this study might be helpful for early recognition of the disease. Funding: National Natural Science Foundation of China. © 2020 The Author(s).

We aimed to generate new national growth charts for French children in the context of huge datasets of physical growth measurements routinely collected by office-based health practitioners. Methods: We recruited 32 randomly sampled primary care paediatricians and ten volunteer general practitioners from across the French metropolitan territory who used the same electronic medical records software, from which we extracted all physical growth data for the paediatric patients, with anonymisation. We included measurements from all children born from Jan 1, 1990, and aged 1 month to 18 years by Feb 8, 2018, with birthweight greater than 2500 g, to which an automated process of data cleaning developed to detect and delete measurement or transcription errors was applied. Growth charts for weight and height were derived by using generalised additive models for location, scale, and shape with the Box-Cox power exponential distribution. We compared the new charts to WHO growth charts and existing French national growth charts, and validated our charts using growth data from recent national cross-sectional surveys. Findings: After data cleaning, we included 1 458 468 height and 1 690 340 weight measurements from 238 102 children. When compared with the existing French national and WHO growth charts, all height SD and weight percentile curves for the new growth charts were distinctly above those for the existing French national growth charts, as early as age 1 month, with an average difference of −0·75 SD for height and −0·50 SD for weight for both sexes. Comparison with national cross-sectional surveys showed satisfactory calibration, with generally good fit for children aged 5–6 years and 10–11 years in height and weight and small differences at age 14–15 years. Interpretation: We successfully produced calibrated paediatric growth charts by using a novel big-data approach applied to data routinely collected in clinical practice that could be used in many fields other than anthropometry.

The combination of machine-learning methods and electronic health records (EHRs) could help address this gap. Methods: This case-control development and validation study is based on EHR data from IBM Explorys. The IBM Explorys Platform holds standardised, longitudinal, de-identified, patient-level EHR data pooled from different health-care systems with distinct EHRs. The present EHR-based studies were retrospective, matched (1:1), case-control studies compliant with RECORD, STROBE, and TRIPOD statements. The study included individuals in the IBM Explorys database who at some point between 1990 and 2018 had a diagnosis of FEP followed by schizophrenia, and psychosis-free matched control individuals from a random subsample of the full cohort. For every individual in the FEP cohort, the individual in the control cohort was matched to have a similar date for inclusion in the database and a similar total observation time. Individuals in the FEP cohort had their index date defined as the first diagnosis of psychosis or the first prescription of antipsychotic medication. Individuals in the control cohort had their index date defined to occur the same number of days after inclusion in the database as their matching FEP individual. The FEP and control cohorts were both randomly split into development and validation datasets in a ratio of 7:3. The subset of individuals in the validation dataset who had all their health-care encounters at providers that were not seen in the development dataset made up the external validation subset. A novel recurrent neural network model was developed to predict the risk of FEP 1 year before the index date by employing demographics and medical events (in the categories diagnoses, prescriptions, procedures, encounters and admissions, observations, and laboratory test results) dynamically collected in the EHR as part of clinical routine. We named the recurrent neural network Dynamic ElecTronic hEalth reCord deTection (DETECT). The main outcomes were accuracy and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Decision-curve analyses and dynamic patient journey plots were used to evaluate clinical usefulness. Findings: The FEP and control cohorts each comprised 72 860 individuals. 102 030 individuals (51 015 matching pairs) were randomly allocated to the development dataset and the remaining 43 690 to the validation dataset. In the validation dataset, 4770 individuals had all their encounters outside of the 118 790 health-care providers that were encountered in the development dataset. The data from these individuals made up the external validation subset. The median follow-up (observation time before index date) was 6·0 years (IQR 3·0–10·4). In the development dataset, DETECT's prognostic accuracy was 0·787 and AUROC was 0·868. In the validation dataset, DETECT's prognostic accuracy was 0·774 and AUROC was 0·856. In the external test subset, DETECT's balanced prognostic accuracy was 0·724 and AUROC was 0·799. Prevalence-adjusted decision-curve analyses suggested that DETECT was associated with a positive net benefit in two different scenarios for FEP detection. Interpretation: DETECT showed adequate prognostic accuracy to detect individuals at risk of developing a FEP in primary and secondary care. Replication and refinement in a population-based setting are needed to consolidate these findings. Funding: Lundbeck. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to establish whether a deep learning algorithm (DLA) that enables non-invasive anaemia screening from electrocardiograms (ECGs) might improve the detection of anaemia. Methods: We did a retrospective, multicentre, diagnostic study in which a DLA was developed using ECGs and then internally and externally validated. We used data from two hospitals, Sejong General Hospital (hospital A) and Mediplex Sejong Hospital (hospital B), in South Korea. Data from hospital A was for DLA development and internal validation, and data from hospital B was for external validation. We included individuals who had at least one ECG with a haemoglobin measurement within 1 h of the index ECG and excluded individuals with missing demographic, electrocardiographic, or haemoglobin information. Three types of DLA were developed with 12-lead, 6-lead (limb lead), and single-lead (lead I) ECGs to detect haemoglobin concentrations of 10 g/dL or less. The DLA was built by a convolutional neural network and used 500-Hz raw ECG, age, and sex as input data. Findings: The study period ran from Oct 1, 2016, to Sept 30, 2019, in hospital A and March 1, 2017, to Sept 30, 2019, in hospital B. 40 513 patients at hospital A and 4737 patients at hospital B were eligible for inclusion. We excluded 281 patients at hospital A and 72 patients at hospital B because of missing values for clinical information and ECG data. The development dataset comprised 57 435 ECGs from 31 898 patients, and the algorithm was internally validated with 7974 ECGs from 7974 patients. The external validation dataset included 4665 ECGs from 4665 patients. 586 (internal) and 194 (external) patients within the combined dataset were found to be anaemic. During internal and external validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of the DLA using a 12-lead ECG for detecting anaemia was 0·923 for internal validation and 0·901 for external validation. Using a 90% sensitivity operating point for the development data, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of internal validation were 89·8%, 81·5%, 99·4%, and 20·0%, respectively, and those of external validation were 86·1%, 76·2%, 99·2%, and 13·5%, respectively. The DLA focused on the QRS complex for deciding the presence of anaemia in a sensitivity map. The AUROCs of DLAs using 6 leads and a single lead were in the range of 0·841–0·890. Interpretation: In this study, using raw ECG data, a DLA accurately detected anaemia. The application of artificial intelligence to ECGs could enable screening for anaemia.

However, 90% of individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia remain undiagnosed in the USA. We aimed to accelerate early diagnosis and timely intervention for more than 1·3 million undiagnosed individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia at high risk for early heart attacks and strokes by applying machine learning to large health-care encounter datasets. Methods: We trained the FIND FH machine learning model using deidentified health-care encounter data, including procedure and diagnostic codes, prescriptions, and laboratory findings, from 939 clinically diagnosed individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia (395 of whom had a molecular diagnosis) and 83 136 individuals presumed free of familial hypercholesterolaemia, sampled from four US institutions. The model was then applied to a national health-care encounter database (170 million individuals) and an integrated health-care delivery system dataset (174 000 individuals). Individuals used in model training and those evaluated by the model were required to have at least one cardiovascular disease risk factor (eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, or hyperlipidemia). A Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996-compliant programme was developed to allow providers to receive identification of individuals likely to have familial hypercholesterolaemia in their practice. Findings: Using a model with a measured precision (positive predictive value) of 0·85, recall (sensitivity) of 0·45, area under the precision–recall curve of 0·55, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0·89, we flagged 1 331 759 of 170 416 201 patients in the national database and 866 of 173 733 individuals in the health-care delivery system dataset as likely to have familial hypercholesterolaemia. Familial hypercholesterolaemia experts reviewed a sample of flagged individuals (45 from the national database and 103 from the health-care delivery system dataset) and applied clinical familial hypercholesterolaemia diagnostic criteria. Of those reviewed, 87% (95% Cl 73–100) in the national database and 77% (68–86) in the health-care delivery system dataset were categorised as having a high enough clinical suspicion of familial hypercholesterolaemia to warrant guideline-based clinical evaluation and treatment. Interpretation: The FIND FH model successfully scans large, diverse, and disparate health-care encounter databases to identify individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia.

Current clinical methods of estimating fetal gestational age are often inaccurate. For example, between 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, the width of the 95% prediction interval around the actual gestational age is estimated to be 18–36 days, even when the best ultrasound estimates are used. The aims of this study are to improve estimates of fetal gestational age and provide personalised predictions of future growth. Methods: Using ultrasound-derived, fetal biometric data, we developed a machine learning approach to accurately estimate gestational age. The accuracy of the method is determined by reference to exactly known facts pertaining to each fetus—specifically, intervals between ultrasound visits—rather than the date of the mother's last menstrual period. The data stem from a sample of healthy, well-nourished participants in a large, multicentre, population-based study, the International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st Century (INTERGROWTH-21st). The generalisability of the algorithm is shown with data from a different and more heterogeneous population (INTERBIO-21st Fetal Study). Findings: In the context of two large datasets, we estimated gestational age between 20 and 30 weeks of gestation with 95% confidence to within 3 days, using measurements made in a 10-week window spanning the second and third trimesters. Fetal gestational age can thus be estimated in the 20–30 weeks gestational age window with a prediction interval 3–5 times better than with any previous algorithm. This will enable improved management of individual pregnancies. 6-week forecasts of the growth trajectory for a given fetus are accurate to within 7 days. This will help identify at-risk fetuses more accurately than currently possible. At population level, the higher accuracy is expected to improve fetal growth charts and population health assessments. Interpretation: Machine learning can circumvent long-standing limitations in determining fetal gestational age and future growth trajectory, without recourse to often inaccurately known information, such as the date of the mother's last menstrual period. Using this algorithm in clinical practice could facilitate the management of individual pregnancies and improve population-level health. Upon publication of this study, the algorithm for gestational age estimates will be provided for research purposes free of charge via a web portal.

Our primary objective was to test whether direct (targeting suicidality) and indirect (targeting depression) digital interventions are effective in reducing suicidal ideation and behaviours, and our secondary analyses assessed whether direct interventions were more effective than indirect interventions. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched online databases MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomised controlled trials published between database inception to May 21, 2019. Superiority randomised controlled trials of self-guided digital interventions (app or web based, which delivered theory-based therapeutic content) were included if they reported suicidal ideation, suicidal plans, or suicide attempts as an outcome. Non-inferiority randomised controlled trials were excluded to ensure comparability of the effect. Data were extracted from published reports, and intention-to-treat data were used if available. The primary outcome was the difference in mean scores of validated suicidal ideation measures (Hedges' g) with the associated 95% CI for the analysis of digital intervention effectiveness on suicidal ideation. We also present funnel plots of the primary outcome measure (suicidal ideation) for direct and indirect interventions to assess for publication bias. We calculated I2 (with I2 CI) values to test heterogeneity. We used random-effects modelling for the meta-analyses to assess the primary and secondary outcomes. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018102084. Findings: The literature search yielded 739 articles (including manual searching) for suicidality and 8842 articles for depression. After screening, 14 papers reporting on 16 studies were included in the narrative review and meta-analysis. The 16 studies (ten on direct interventions and six on indirect interventions) provided baseline data for 4398 participants. The primary outcome of overall post-intervention effect for suicidal ideation was small but significant immediately following the active intervention phase (Hedges' g −0·18, 95% CI −0·27 to −0·10, p<0·0001; I2=0%, I2 CI 0·0–47·9). The secondary objective, comparing direct and indirect interventions, showed that direct interventions (targeting suicidality) significantly reduced suicidal ideation at post-intervention (g −0·23, 95% CI −0·35 to −0·11, p<0·0001; I2=17·6%, I2 CI 0·0–58·6), but indirect interventions (targeting depression) failed to reach significance (g −0·12, 95% CI −0·25 to 0·01, p=0·071; I2=0%, I2 CI 0·0–30·7). Interpretation: Self-guided digital interventions directly targeting suicidal ideation are effective immediately post-intervention. Indirect interventions were not significant for reducing suicidal ideation. Our findings suggest that digital interventions should be promoted and disseminated widely, especially where there is a lack of, or minimal access to, health services.

Evening and overnight closed-loop control might account for most of the benefits of 24/7 continuous closed-loop control; however, to our knowledge, no direct comparison of these systems has yet been done. In this study, we sought to compare different configurations of a closed-loop control system with activation of automated insulin delivery during the evening and overnight hours compared with continuous 24/7 closed-loop control, and both treatment modalities compared with sensor-augmented insulin pump use. Methods: In this randomised crossover trial at the University of Virginia (Charlottesville, VA, USA), we randomly assigned (1:1) participants aged 18 to up to 70 years with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least 1 year to one of two sequences of four 8-week treatment sessions: sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy, evening and overnight closed-loop control, continuous 24/7 closed-loop control, and evening and overnight closed-loop control (group A) or evening and overnight closed-loop control, continuous 24/7 closed-loop control, evening and overnight closed-loop control, and sensor-augmented pump therapy (group B). Randomisation was done by non-clinical study staff using a computer-generated sequence of Bernoulli trials. The primary outcome of the study was the difference in the percentage of time continuous glucose monitored glucose was less than 3·9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) during sensor-augmented pump therapy compared with evening and overnight closed-loop control. Our overall analysis followed a modified intention-to-treat approach, with all available data for participants who had completed at least two study sessions included in the analysis, regardless of actual use of a closed-loop control device. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02679287. Findings: Between April 21, 2016, and June 1, 2018, we assessed 103 patients for eligibility and 93 were randomly assigned to group A (n=47) or group B (n=46). Our final analysis included 80 participants who had completed at least two study phases (40 in group A and 40 in group B). Compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy sessions, evening and overnight closed-loop control sessions reduced the mean overall (day and night) percentage of time blood glucose was less than 70 mg/dL (3·9 mmol/L) from 4·0% (SD 3·3) to 2·2% (1·8), an absolute difference of −1·8% (95% CI 1·2–2·4; p<0·0001). This was accompanied by an overall reduction in HbA1c from mean 7·4% (SD 1·0) at baseline to 7·1% (0·9) at the end of the study, resulting in an absolute difference of −0·3% (95% CI 0·1–0·4%; p<0·0001). We observed no cases of diabetic ketoacidosis. There were three cases of hyperglycaemia with ketosis that did not meet the criteria for diabetic ketoacidosis, all of which were treated at home with insulin and oral fluid, without known malfunction of the investigational device. There were five cases of severe hypoglycaemia attributed to user-directed boluses without malfunction of the investigational device. Interpretation: In type 1 diabetes, evening and overnight closed-loop control was superior to sensor-augmented pump therapy, achieving most of the glycaemic benefits of 24/7 continuous closed-loop control. Our findings could offer people with type 1 diabetes more flexibility in treatment options with use of automated insulin delivery systems at varying times of day.

However, there are no large-scale studies to clarify whether PAP is well tolerated in children, and which factors are associated with better adherence to PAP therapy. In this study, we aimed to clarify adherence patterns of PAP therapy in a large paediatric population. Methods: We did a cross-sectional big-data analysis in children from Oct 1, 2014, to Aug 1, 2018, using existing data derived from PAP devices uploaded nightly in the AirView cloud database. The AirView database is a usage tracking system available to all patients who are assigned PAP therapy, which requires consent from the patient or parent or guardian. All patients older than 4 years and younger than 18 years who used continuous or automated PAP devices were evaluated. Only patients living in the USA and enrolled with a single insurance company were included. If patients were participating in an engagement programme, programme onset must have been within 7 days of therapy onset. Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients who used PAP continuously over 90 days. The primary outcome was assessed in all patients who met the age inclusion criterion and had reliable age data available. Data on missing PAP use were imputed as zero, but data on other metrics were not imputed and excluded from analysis. Findings: We used data recorded from Oct 1, 2014, to Aug 1, 2018. Of 40 140 children screened, 36 058 (89·8%) were US residents and 20 553 (90·1%) of them met the eligibility criteria and had accessible data (mean age 13·0 years [SD 3·7]). On the basis of 90 days of monitoring data, 12 699 (61·8%) patients continuously used PAP. Factors significantly associated with adherence included age group, residual apnoea–hypopnoea index, use and onset of patient engagement programmes, PAP pressure, and nightly median PAP mask leak, all over the 90-day study period. Interpretation: To our knowledge, our study represents the largest analysis of children using PAP therapy to date. The findings suggest that adherence to PAP therapy is lower than in previous reports from adults. However, numerous actionable factors were associated with improvements in adherence and should be used strategically in clinical decision making to improve PAP adherence in children.

We aimed to assess whether mobile teledermoscopy-enhanced skin self-examination can improve sensitivity and specificity of self-detection of skin cancers when compared with naked-eye skin self-examination. Methods: This randomised, controlled trial was done in Brisbane (QLD, Australia). Eligible participants (aged ≥18 years) had at least two skin cancer risk factors as self-reported in the eligibility survey and had to own or have access to an iPhone compatible with a dermatoscope attachment (iPhone versions 5–8). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation procedure, to the intervention group (mobile dermoscopy-enhanced self-skin examination) or the control group (naked-eye skin self-examination). Control group and intervention group participants received web-based instructions on how to complete a whole body skin self-examination. All participants completed skin examinations at baseline, 1 month, and 2 months; intervention group participants submitted photographs of suspicious lesions to a dermatologist for telediagnosis after each skin examination and control group participants noted lesions on a body chart that was sent to the research team after each skin examination. All participants had an in-person whole-body clinical skin examination within 3 months of their last skin self-examination. Primary outcomes were sensitivity and specificity of skin self-examination, patient selection of clinically atypical lesions suspicious for melanoma or keratinocyte skin cancers (body sites examined, number of lesions photographed, types of lesions, and lesions missed), and diagnostic concordance of telediagnosis versus in-person whole-body clinical skin examination diagnosis. All primary outcomes were analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who had a clinical skin examination within 3 months of their last skin self-examination. This trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12616000989448. Findings: Between March 6, 2017, and June 7, 2018, 234 participants consented to enrol in the study, of whom 116 (50%) were assigned to the intervention group and 118 (50%) were assigned to the control group. 199 participants (98 participants in the intervention group and 101 participants in the control group) attended the clinical skin examination and thus were eligible for analyses. Participants in the intervention group submitted 615 lesions (median 6·0 per person; range 1–24) for telediagnosis and participants in the control group identified and recorded 673 lesions (median 6·0 per person; range 1–16). At the lesion level, sensitivity for lesions clinically suspicious for skin cancer was 75% (95% CI 63–84) in the intervention group and 88% (95% CI 80–91) in the control group (p=0·04). Specificity was 87% (95% CI 85–90) in the intervention group and 89% (95% CI 87–91) in the control group (p=0·42). At the individual level, the intervention group had a sensitivity of 87% (95% CI 76–99) compared with 97% (95% CI 91–100) in the control group (p=0·26), and a specificity of 95% (95% CI 90–100) compared with 96% (95% CI 91–100) in the control group. The overall diagnostic concordance between the telediagnosis and in-person clinical skin examination was 88%. Interpretation: The use of mobile teledermoscopy did not increase sensitivity for the detection of skin cancers compared with naked-eye skin self-examination; thus, further evidence is necessary for inclusion of skin self-examination technology for public health benefit.

We hypothesised that an innovative intelligent insole system would be effective in reducing diabetic foot ulcer recurrence in such patients. Methods: In this prospective, randomised, proof-of-concept study, patients with diabetes, and with peripheral neuropathy and a recent history of plantar foot ulceration were recruited from two multidisciplinary outpatient diabetic foot clinics in the UK, and were randomly assigned to either intervention or control. All patients received an insole system, which measured plantar pressure continuously during daily life. The intervention group received audiovisual alerts via a smartwatch linked to the insole system and offloading instructions when aberrant pressures were detected; the control group did not receive any alerts. The primary outcome was plantar foot ulcer occurrence within 18 months. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN05585501, and is closed to accrual and complete. Findings: Between March 18, 2014, and Dec 20, 2016, 90 patients were recruited and consented to the study, and 58 completed the study. At follow-up, ten ulcers from 8638 person-days were recorded in the control group and four ulcers from 11 835 person-days in the intervention group: a 71% reduction in ulcer incidence in the intervention group compared with the control group (incidence rate ratio 0·29, 95% CI, 0·09–0·93; p=0·037). The number of patients who ulcerated was similar between groups (six of 26 [control group] vs four of 32 [intervention group]; p=0·29); however, individual plantar sites ulcerated more often in the control group (ten of 416) than in the intervention group (four of 512; p=0·047). In an exploratory analysis of good compliers (n=40), ulcer incidence was reduced by 86% in the intervention group versus control group (incidence rate ratio 0·14, 95% CI 0·03–0·63; p=0·011). In the exploratory analysis, plantar callus severity (change from baseline to 6 months) was greater in re-ulcerating patients (6·5, IQR 4·0–8·3) than non-re-ulcerating patients (2·0, 0·0–4·8; p=0·040). Interpretation: To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that continuous plantar pressure monitoring and dynamic offloading guidance, provided by an innovative intelligent insole system, can lead to a reduction in diabetic foot ulcer site recurrence.

We aimed to develop an accurate screening protocol by estimating the 3-year lung cancer risk after two screening CT scans using deep learning of radiologists' CT readings and other universally available clinical information. Methods: A deep learning algorithm (referred to as DeepLR) was developed using data from participants who had received at least two CT screening scans up to 2 years apart in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST; training cohort). Double-blinded validation was done using data from participants in the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer (PanCan) study (validation cohort). The primary analysis was to compare accuracy of DeepLR scores to predict lung cancer incidence at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years with the Lung CT Screening Reporting & Data System (Lung-RADS) and volume doubling time, using time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. Findings: The training cohort consisted of 25 097 participants from NLST and the validation cohort comprised 2294 individuals from PanCan. In the validation cohort, DeepLR showed good discrimination, with 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year time-dependent AUC values for cancer diagnosis of 0·968 (SD 0·013), 0·946 (0·013), and 0·899 (0·017), respectively. Among individuals deemed high risk by DeepLR, 94%, 85%, and 71% of incident and interval lung cancers diagnosed within 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively, after the second screening CT scan were identified. Furthermore, individuals with high DeepLR scores had a significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio 16·07, 95% CI 10·15–25·44; p<0·0001) among people with high scores on Lung-RADS. Interpretation: DeepLR recognises patterns in both temporal and spatial changes and synergy among changes in nodule and non-nodule features. DeepLR scores could be used to accurately guide clinical management after the next scheduled repeat screening CT scan.

We aimed to assess whether the Diabeloop Generation 1 (DBLG1) hybrid closed-loop artificial pancreas system improved glucose control compared with sensor-assisted pump therapy. Methods: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised, crossover trial, we recruited adults (aged ≥18 years) with at least a 2 year history of type 1 diabetes, who had been treated with external insulin pump therapy for at least 6 months, had glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 10% or less (86 mmol/mol), and preserved hypoglycaemia awareness. After a 2-week run-in period, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a web-based system in randomly permuted blocks of two, to receive insulin via the hybrid closed-loop system (DBLG1; using a machine-learning-based algorithm) or sensor-assisted pump therapy over 12 weeks of free living, followed by an 8-week washout period and then the other intervention for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of time that the sensor glucose concentration was within the target range (3·9–10·0 mmol/L) during the 12 week study period. Efficacy analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned patients who completed both 12 week treatment periods. Safety analyses were done in all patients who were exposed to either of the two treatments at least once during the study. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02987556. Findings: Between March 3, 2017, and June 19, 2017, 71 patients were screened, and 68 eligible patients were randomly assigned to the DBLG1 group (n=33) or the sensor-assisted pump therapy group (n=35), of whom five dropped out in the washout period (n=1 pregnancy; n=4 withdrew consent). 63 patients completed both 12 week treatment periods and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The proportion of time that the glucose concentration was within the target range was significantly higher in the DBLG1 group (68·5% [SD 9·4] than the sensor-assisted pump group (59·4% [10·2]; mean difference 9·2% [95% CI 6·4 to 11·9]; p<0·0001). Five severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in the DBLG1 group and three episodes occurred in the sensor-assisted pump therapy group, which were associated with hardware malfunctions or human error. Interpretation: The DBLG1 system improves glucose control compared with sensor-assisted insulin pumps. This finding supports the use of closed-loop technology combined with appropriate health care organisation in adults with type 1 diabetes.

In this Article, we share our acquired knowledge of the logistical and legal challenges associated with the use of patient-specific 3D-printed implants to treat spinal instabilities. Methods: Two patients with semiurgent cases of spinal instability presented to our hospital in the Netherlands. In case 1, severe kyphotic deformity of the thoracic spine due to neurofibromatosis type 1 had led to incomplete paralysis, and a strong metallic strut extending from C6 to T11 was deemed necessary to provide long-term anterior support. In case 2, the patient presented with progressive paralysis caused by cervicothoracic dissociation due to vanishing bone disease. As the C5–T1 vertebral bodies had mostly vanished, an implant spanning the anterior spine from C4 to T2 was required. Because of the complex and challenging nature of both cases, conventional approaches were deemed inadequate; instead, patient-specific implants were designed with use of CT scans and computer-aided design software, and 3D printed in titanium with direct metal printing. For each implant, to ensure patient safety, a comprehensive technical file (describing the clinical substantiation, technical and design considerations, risk analysis, manufacturing process, and labelling) was produced in collaboration with a university department certified for the development and manufacturing of medical devices. Because the implants were categorised as custom-made or personalised devices under the EU Medical Device Regulation, the usual procedures for review and approval of medical devices by a notified body were not required. Finite-element analyses, compression strength tests, and cadaveric experiments were also done to ensure the devices were safe to use. Findings: The planning, design, production, and insertion of the 3D-printed personalised implant took around 6 months in the first patient, but, given the experience from the first case, only took around 6 weeks in the second patient. In both patients, the surgeries went as planned and good positioning of each implant was confirmed. Both patients were discharged home within 1 week after the surgery. In the first patient, a fatigue fracture occured in one of the conventional posterior fusion rods after 10 months, which we repaired, without any deformation of the spine or signs of failure of the personalised implant observed. No other adverse events occurred up to 25 months of follow-up in case 1 and 6 months of follow-up in case 2. Interpretation: Patient-specific treatment approaches incorporating 3D-printed implants can be helpful in carefully selected cases when conventional methods are not an option. Comprehensive and efficient interactions between medical engineers and physicians are essential to establish well designed frameworks to navigate the logistical and regulatory aspects of technology development to ensure the safety and legal validity of patient-specific treatments. The framework described here could encourage physicians to treat (once untreatable) patients with novel personalised techniques.

Interventions targeting multiple risk behaviours in adolescents have the potential to efficiently improve health outcomes, yet further evidence is required to determine their effect. We reviewed the effectiveness of eHealth school-based interventions targeting multiple lifestyle risk behaviours. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library databases between Jan 1, 2000, and March 14, 2019, with no language restrictions, for publications on school-based eHealth multiple health behaviour interventions in humans. We also screened the grey literature for unpublished data. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials of eHealth (internet, computers, tablets, mobile technology, or tele-health) interventions targeting two or more of six behaviours of interest: alcohol use, smoking, diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep. Primary outcomes of interest were the prevention or reduction of unhealthy behaviours, or improvement in healthy behaviours of the six behaviours. Outcomes were summarised in a narrative synthesis and combined using random-effects meta-analysis. This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO, identifier CRD42017072163. Findings: Of 10 571 identified records, 22 publications assessing 16 interventions were included, comprising 18 873 students, of whom on average 56·2% were female, with a mean age of 13·41 years (SD 1·52). eHealth school-based multiple health behaviour change interventions significantly increased fruit and vegetable intake (standard mean difference 0·11, 95% CI 0·03 to 0·19; p=0·007) and both accelerometer-measured (0·33, 0·05 to 0·61; p=0·02) and self-reported (0·14, 0·05 to 0·23; p=0·003) physical activity, and reduced screen time (−0·09, −0·17 to −0·01; p=0·03) immediately after the intervention; however, these effects were not sustained at follow-up when data were available. No effect was seen for alcohol or smoking, fat or sugar-sweetened beverage or snack consumption. No studies examined sleep or used mobile health interventions. The risk of bias in masking of final outcome assessors and selective outcome reporting was high or unclear across studies and overall we deemd the quality of evidence to be low to very low. Interpretation: eHealth school-based interventions addressing multiple lifestyle risk behaviours can be effective in improving physical activity, screen time, and fruit and vegetable intake. However, effects were small and only evident immediately after the intervention. Further high quality, adolescent-informed research is needed to develop eHealth interventions that can modify multiple behaviours and sustain long-term effects.

Severity scores based mainly on acute physiology measures collected at ICU admission are used to predict mortality, but are non-specific, and predictions for individual patients can be inaccurate. We investigated whether inclusion of long-term disease history before ICU admission improves mortality predictions. Methods: Registry data for long-term disease histories for more than 230 000 Danish ICU patients were used in a neural network to develop an ICU mortality prediction model. Long-term disease histories and acute physiology measures were aggregated to predict mortality risk for patients for whom both registry and ICU electronic patient record data were available. We compared mortality predictions with admission scores on the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, and the best available multimorbidity score, the Multimorbidity Index. An external validation set from an additional hospital was acquired after model construction to confirm the validity of our model. During initial model development data were split into a training set (85%) and an independent test set (15%), and a five-fold cross-validation was done during training to avoid overfitting. Neural networks were trained for datasets with disease history of 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2·5 years, 5 years, 7·5 years, 10 years, and 23 years before ICU admission. Findings: Mortality predictions with a model based solely on disease history outperformed the Multimorbidity Index (Matthews correlation coefficient 0·265 vs 0·065), and performed similarly to SAPS II and APACHE II (Matthews correlation coefficient with disease history, age, and sex 0·326 vs 0·347 and 0·300 for SAPS II and APACHE II, respectively). Diagnoses up to 10 years before ICU admission affected current mortality prediction. Aggregation of previous disease history and acute physiology measures in a neural network yielded the most precise predictions of in-hospital mortality (Matthews correlation coefficient 0·391 for in-hospital mortality compared with 0·347 with SAPS II and 0·300 with APACHE II). These results for the aggregated model were validated in an external independent dataset of 1528 patients (Matthews correlation coefficient for prediction of in-hospital mortality 0·341). Interpretation: Longitudinal disease-spectrum-wide data available before ICU admission are useful for mortality prediction. Disease history can be used to differentiate mortality risk between patients with similar vital signs with more precision than SAPS II and APACHE II scores. Machine learning models can be deconvoluted to generate novel understandings of how ICU patient features from long-term and short-term events interact with each other. Explainable machine learning models are key in clinical settings, and our results emphasise how to progress towards the transformation of advanced models into actionable, transparent, and trustworthy clinical tools.

In this trial, we aimed to assess the effect of chat-based instant messaging support integrated with brief interventions on smoking cessation in a cohort of smokers proactively recruited from the community. Methods: In this two-arm, pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled trial, we recruited participants aged 18 years or older who smoked at least one cigarette per day from 68 community sites in Hong Kong, China. Community sites were computer randomised (1:1) to the intervention group, in which participants received chat-based instant messaging support for 3 months, offers of referral to external smoking cessation services, and brief advice, or to the control group, in which participants received brief advice alone. The chat-based intervention included personalised behavioural support and promoted use of smoking cessation services. Masking of participants and the research team was not possible, but outcome assessors were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was smoking abstinence validated by exhaled carbon monoxide concentrations lower than 4 parts per million and salivary cotinine concentrations lower than 10 ng/mL at 6 months after treatment initiation (3 months after the end of treatment). The primary analysis was by intention to treat and accounted for potential clustering effect by use of generalised estimating equation models. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03182790. Findings: Between June 18 and Sept 30, 2017, 1185 participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention (n=591) or control (n=594) groups. At the 6-month follow-up (77% of participants retained), the proportion of validated abstinence was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (48 [8%] of 591 in intervention vs 30 [5%] of 594 in control group, unadjusted odds ratio 1·68, 95% CI 1·03–2·74; p=0·040). Engagement in the chat-based support in the intervention group was low (17%), but strongly predicted abstinence with or without use of external smoking cessation services. Interpretation: Chat-based instant messaging support integrated with brief cessation interventions increased smoking abstinence and could complement existing smoking cessation services.

We sought to evaluate the utility of automated deep learning software to develop medical image diagnostic classifiers by health-care professionals with no coding—and no deep learning—expertise. Methods: We used five publicly available open-source datasets: retinal fundus images (MESSIDOR); optical coherence tomography (OCT) images (Guangzhou Medical University and Shiley Eye Institute, version 3); images of skin lesions (Human Against Machine [HAM] 10000), and both paediatric and adult chest x-ray (CXR) images (Guangzhou Medical University and Shiley Eye Institute, version 3 and the National Institute of Health [NIH] dataset, respectively) to separately feed into a neural architecture search framework, hosted through Google Cloud AutoML, that automatically developed a deep learning architecture to classify common diseases. Sensitivity (recall), specificity, and positive predictive value (precision) were used to evaluate the diagnostic properties of the models. The discriminative performance was assessed using the area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC). In the case of the deep learning model developed on a subset of the HAM10000 dataset, we did external validation using the Edinburgh Dermofit Library dataset. Findings: Diagnostic properties and discriminative performance from internal validations were high in the binary classification tasks (sensitivity 73·3–97·0%; specificity 67–100%; AUPRC 0·87–1·00). In the multiple classification tasks, the diagnostic properties ranged from 38% to 100% for sensitivity and from 67% to 100% for specificity. The discriminative performance in terms of AUPRC ranged from 0·57 to 1·00 in the five automated deep learning models. In an external validation using the Edinburgh Dermofit Library dataset, the automated deep learning model showed an AUPRC of 0·47, with a sensitivity of 49% and a positive predictive value of 52%. Interpretation: All models, except the automated deep learning model trained on the multilabel classification task of the NIH CXR14 dataset, showed comparable discriminative performance and diagnostic properties to state-of-the-art performing deep learning algorithms. The performance in the external validation study was low. The quality of the open-access datasets (including insufficient information about patient flow and demographics) and the absence of measurement for precision, such as confidence intervals, constituted the major limitations of this study. The availability of automated deep learning platforms provide an opportunity for the medical community to enhance their understanding in model development and evaluation. Although the derivation of classification models without requiring a deep understanding of the mathematical, statistical, and programming principles is attractive, comparable performance to expertly designed models is limited to more elementary classification tasks. Furthermore, care should be placed in adhering to ethical principles when using these automated models to avoid discrimination and causing harm. Future studies should compare several application programming interfaces on thoroughly curated datasets.

Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) model using deep learning in a population-based diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Zambia, a lower-middle-income country. Methods: We adopted an ensemble AI model consisting of a combination of two convolutional neural networks (an adapted VGGNet architecture and a residual neural network architecture) for classifying retinal colour fundus images. We trained our model on 76 370 retinal fundus images from 13 099 patients with diabetes who had participated in the Singapore Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Program, between 2010 and 2013, which has been published previously. In this clinical validation study, we included all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes that attended a mobile screening unit in five urban centres in the Copperbelt province of Zambia from Feb 1 to June 31, 2012. In our model, referable diabetic retinopathy was defined as moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse, diabetic macular oedema, and ungradable images. Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy comprised severe non-proliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for referable diabetic retinopathy, and sensitivities of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema compared with the grading by retinal specialists. We did a multivariate analysis for systemic risk factors and referable diabetic retinopathy between AI and human graders. Findings: A total of 4504 retinal fundus images from 3093 eyes of 1574 Zambians with diabetes were prospectively recruited. Referable diabetic retinopathy was found in 697 (22·5%) eyes, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy in 171 (5·5%) eyes, and diabetic macular oedema in 249 (8·1%) eyes. The AUC of the AI system for referable diabetic retinopathy was 0·973 (95% CI 0·969–0·978), with corresponding sensitivity of 92·25% (90·10–94·12) and specificity of 89·04% (87·85–90·28). Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy sensitivity was 99·42% (99·15–99·68) and diabetic macular oedema sensitivity was 97·19% (96·61–97·77). The AI model and human graders showed similar outcomes in referable diabetic retinopathy prevalence detection and systemic risk factors associations. Both the AI model and human graders identified longer duration of diabetes, higher level of glycated haemoglobin, and increased systolic blood pressure as risk factors associated with referable diabetic retinopathy. Interpretation: An AI system shows clinically acceptable performance in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic macular oedema in population-based diabetic retinopathy screening. This shows the potential application and adoption of such AI technology in an under-resourced African population to reduce the incidence of preventable blindness, even when the model is trained in a different population.

Response time might be reduced by reliable self-detection. We aimed to formally assess the proof-of-concept and accuracy of self-detection of acute coronary artery occlusion by patients during daily life situations and during the very early stages of acute coronary artery occlusion. Methods: In this multicentre, observational study, we tested the operational feasibility, specificity, and sensitivity of our RELF method, a three-lead detection system with an automatic algorithm built into a mobile handheld device, for detection of acute coronary artery occlusion. Patients were recruited continuously by physician referrals from three Belgian hospitals until the desired sample size was achieved, had been discharged with planned elective percutaneous coronary intervention, and were able to use a smartphone; they were asked to perform random ambulatory self-recordings for at least 1 week. A similar self-recording was made before percutaneous coronary intervention and at 60 s of balloon occlusion. Patients were clinically followed up until 1 month after discharge. We quantitatively assessed the operational feasibility with an automated dichotomous quality check of self-recordings. Performance was assessed by analysing the receiver operator characteristics of the ST difference vector magnitude. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02983396. Findings: From Nov 18, 2016, to April 25, 2018, we enrolled 64 patients into the study, of whom 59 (92%) were eligible for self-applications. 58 (91%) of 64 (95% CI 81·0–95·6) patients were able to perform ambulatory self-recordings. Of all 5011 self-recordings, 4567 (91%) were automatically classified as successful within 1 min. In 65 balloon occlusions, 63 index tests at 60 s of occlusion in 55 patients were available. The mean specificity of daily life recordings was 0·96 (0·95–0·97). The mean false positive rate during daily life conditions was 4·19% (95% CI 3·29–5·10). The sensitivity for the target conditions was 0·87 (55 of 63; 95% CI 0·77–0·93) for acute coronary artery occlusion, 0·95 (54 of 57; 0·86–0·98) for acute coronary artery occlusion with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and 1·00 (35 of 35) for acute coronary artery occlusion with ECG changes and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction criteria (STEMI). The index test was more sensitive to detect a 60 s balloon occlusion than the STEMI criteria on 12-lead ECG (87% vs 56%; p<0·0001). The proportion of total variation in study estimates due to heterogeneity between patients (I2) was low (12·6%). The area under the receiver operator characteristics curve was 0·973 (95% CI 0·956–0·990) for acute coronary artery occlusion at different cutoff values of the magnitude of the ST difference vector. No patients died during the study. Interpretation: Self-recording with our RELF device is feasible for most patients with coronary artery disease. The sensitivity and specificity for automatic detection of the earliest phase of acute coronary artery occlusion support the concept of our RELF device for patient empowerment to reduce delay and increase Survival without overloading emergency services.

Although health IT is delivering huge benefits, new technology can also introduce unique risks. Despite these risks, evidence on the preventability and effects of health IT failures on patients is scarce. In our study we therefore sought to evaluate the preventability and effects of health IT failures by examining patient safety incidents in England and Wales. Methods: We designed our study as a retrospective analysis of 10 years of incident reporting in England and Wales. We used text mining with the words “computer”, “system”, “workstation”, and “network” to explore free-text incident descriptors to identify incidents related to health IT failures following a previously described approach. We then applied an n-gram model of searching to identify contiguous sequences of words and provide spatial context. We examined incident details, recorded harm, and preventability. Standard descriptive statistics were applied. Degree of harm was identified according to standardised definitions and preventability was assessed by two independent reviewers. Findings: We identified 2627 incidents related to health IT failures. 2557 (97%) of 2627 incidents were assessed for harm (70 incidents were excluded). 2106 (82%) of 2557 health IT failures caused no harm to patients, 331 (13%) caused low harm, 102 (4%) caused moderate harm, 14 (1%) caused severe harm, and four (<1%) contributed to the death of a patient. 1964 (75%) of 2627 incidents were deemed to be preventable. Interpretation: Health IT is fundamental to the delivery of high-quality care, yet there is a poor understanding of the effects of IT failures on patient safety and whether they can be prevented. Failures are complex and involve interlinked aspects of technology, people, and the environment. Health IT failures are undoubtedly a potential source of substantial harm, but they are likely to be under-reported. Worryingly, three-quarters of IT failures are potentially preventable. There is a need to see health IT as a fundamental tenet of patient safety, develop better methods for capturing the effects of IT failures on patients, and adopt simple measures to reduce their probability and mitigate their risk.

Hence, we aimed to map the course of human health by identifying the 50 most common health conditions in each decade of life and estimating the median age at first diagnosis. Methods: We developed phenotyping algorithms and codelists for physical and mental health conditions that involve intensive use of health-care resources. Individuals older than 1 year were included in the study if their primary-care and hospital-admission records met research standards set by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and they had been registered in a general practice in England contributing up-to-standard data for at least 1 year during the study period. We used linked records of individuals from the CALIBER platform to calculate the sex-standardised cumulative incidence for these conditions by 10-year age groups between April 1, 2010, and March 31, 2015. We also derived the median age at diagnosis and prevalence estimates stratified by age, sex, and ethnicity (black, white, south Asian) over the study period from the primary-care and secondary-care records of patients. Findings: We developed case definitions for 308 disease phenotypes. We used records of 2 784 138 patients for the calculation of cumulative incidence and of 3 872 451 patients for the calculation of period prevalence and median age at diagnosis of these conditions. Conditions that first gained prominence at key stages of life were: atopic conditions and infections that led to hospital admission in children (<10 years); acne and menstrual disorders in the teenage years (10–19 years); mental health conditions, obesity, and migraine in individuals aged 20–29 years; soft-tissue disorders and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in individuals aged 30–39 years; dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and erectile dysfunction in individuals aged 40–59 years; cancer, osteoarthritis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, cataract, diverticular disease, type 2 diabetes, and deafness in individuals aged 60–79 years; and atrial fibrillation, dementia, acute and chronic kidney disease, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, anaemia, and osteoporosis in individuals aged 80 years or older. Black or south-Asian individuals were diagnosed earlier than white individuals for 258 (84%) of the 308 conditions. Bone fractures and atopic conditions were recorded earlier in male individuals, whereas female individuals were diagnosed at younger ages with nutritional anaemias, tubulointerstitial nephritis, and urinary disorders. Interpretation: We have produced the first chronological map of human health with cumulative-incidence and period-prevalence estimates for multiple morbidities in parallel from birth to advanced age. This can guide clinicians, policy makers, and researchers on how to formulate differential diagnoses, allocate resources, and target research priorities on the basis of the knowledge of who gets which diseases when. We have published our phenotyping algorithms on the CALIBER open-access Portal which will facilitate future research by providing a curated list of reusable case definitions.

Past behaviour might predict future behaviour; failing second-line ART could indicate ongoing risk for subsequent non-adherence. We aimed to find out whether a two-way mobile phone-based communication intervention would increase HIV treatment success by improving medication adherence. Methods: We did a multinational, randomised controlled trial of patients at 17 sites in nine lower-income and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Patients aged 18 years and older, with HIV infection, and on second-line protease-inhibitor-based antiretroviral regimens, were randomly assigned (1:1) to either two-way mobile phone intervention plus standard of care (MPI + SOC) adherence support or standard-of-care alone (SOC). Our study was nested within a strategy study of ART after second-line ART failure (the main study, A5288). The main study had four cohorts, which were assigned regimens according to ART history and real-time genotype. Randomisation was stratified by the main study cohort with dynamic institutional balancing. Only the clinical management committee was masked, not the participants or site personnel. Text messages were sent over 48 weeks starting once a day and tapering down to once per week; participants were to respond once to each message if taking ART without issues. Repeated non-response to three messages over a 2-week period for the first 8 weeks, and then two messages over a 2-week period for the remainder of the study, triggered problem-solving counselling by staff. For this study, the primary endpoint was plasma HIV-1 RNA 200 copies per mL or less at 48 weeks and the secondary endpoint was virological failure (two consecutive HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies per mL) at 24 or more weeks. Prespecified intention-to-treat analyses were adjusted for cohort. Follow-up continued until the last participant had reached 48 weeks, with a median follow-up time of 72 weeks. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01641367. Findings: Enrolment began on Feb 22, 2013, and ended on Dec 21, 2015, with the last participant completing follow-up on Feb 13, 2017. Of 545 participants in the main study, 521 (96%) were enrolled and randomly assigned to MPI + SOC (n=257) or SOC alone (n=264). 52% of patients were men and the median HIV-1 RNA 4·4 log10 copies per mL (IQR 3·5 to 5·2). At week 48, HIV-1 RNA 200 copies per mL or less was reached in 169 (66%) of 257 patients in the MPI + SOC group and 164 (62%) of 264 patients in the SOC group (estimated difference 3·6% [95% CI −4·6% to 11·9%]; p=0·39). The adjusted odds ratio comparing MPI + SOC and SOC was 1·23 (0·82 to 1·84; p=0·32). Virological failure occurred in 66 (26%) patients in the MPI + SOC group and 89 (34%) patients in the SOC group during the median 72 weeks follow-up (adjusted p=0·027). Observed difference in virological failure favoured MPI + SOC in all cohorts. 23 (4%) participants died, 11 (4%) in the MPI + SOC group and 12 (5%) in the SOC group (p=0·89), with none of the deaths ascribed to ART, the MPI, or study procedures. Interpretation: Two-way MPI did not significantly improve week 48 suppression, but it did modestly affect virological failure. People failing second-line ART might not achieve benefits from phone-based triggers or enhanced adherence support (or both). More effective strategies are needed.

To advance towards more precise treatments in radiotherapy, we queried the lung CT-derived feature space to identify radiation sensitivity parameters that can predict treatment failure and hence guide the individualisation of radiotherapy dose. Methods: An institutional review board-approved study (IRB 14-562) was used to identify patients treated with lung stereotactic body radiotherapy. Patients with primary (stage IA–IV) or recurrent lung cancer and patients with other cancer types with solitary metastases or oligometastases to the lung were included. Patients without digitally accessible CT image or radiotherapy structure data were excluded. The internal study cohort received treatment at the main campus of the Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, OH, USA). The independent validation cohort received treatment at seven affiliate regional or national sites. We input pre-therapy lung CT images into Deep Profiler, a multi-task deep neural network that has radiomics incorporated into the training process, to generate an image fingerprint that predicts time-to-event treatment outcomes and approximates classical radiomic features. We validated our findings with the independent study cohort. Deep Profiler was combined with clinical variables to derive iGray, an individualised dose that estimates treatment failure probability to be below 5%. Findings: A total of 1275 patients were assessed for eligibility and 944 met our eligibility criteria; 849 were in the internal study cohort and 95 were in the independent validation cohort. Radiation treatments in patients with high Deep Profiler scores failed at a significantly higher rate than in patients with low scores; 3-year cumulative incidence of local failure in the internal study cohort was 20·3% (16·0–24·9) in patients with high Deep Profiler scores and 5·7% (95% CI 3·5–8·8) in patients with low Deep Profiler scores (hazard ratio [HR]=3·64 [95% CI 2·19–6·05], p<0·0001). Deep Profiler independently predicted local failure (HR=1·65 [1·02–2·66], p=0·042). Models that included Deep Profiler and clinical variables predicted treatment failures with a concordance index (C-index) of 0·72 (95% CI 0·67–0·77), a significant improvement compared with classical radiomics (p<0·0001) or clinical variables (p<0·0001) alone. Deep Profiler performed well in the independent validation cohort, predicting treatment failures across diverse clinical settings and CT scanner types (C-index 0·77, 95% CI 0·69–0·92). iGray had a wide dose range (21·1–277 Gy) and suggested dose reductions in 23·3% of patients. Our results also showed that iGray can be safely delivered in the majority of cases. Interpretation: Our results indicate that there are image-distinct subpopulations that have differential sensitivity to radiotherapy. The image-based deep learning framework proposed herein is the first opportunity to use medical images to individualise radiotherapy dose. Our results signify a new roadmap for deep learning-guided predictions and treatment guidance in the image-replete and highly standardised discipline of radiation oncology.

Few reliable validated methods are available to predict the outcome for individual patients in the first clinical contact. In this study, we aimed to build multivariable prediction models of 1-year remission and recovery outcomes using baseline clinical variables in people with first-episode psychosis. Methods: In this machine learning approach, we applied supervised machine learning, using regularised regression and nested leave-one-site-out cross-validation, to baseline clinical data from the English Evaluating the Development and Impact of Early Intervention Services (EDEN) study (n=1027), to develop and internally validate prediction models at 1-year follow-up. We assessed four binary outcomes that were recorded at 1 year: symptom remission, social recovery, vocational recovery, and quality of life (QoL). We externally validated the prediction models by selecting from the top predictor variables identified in the internal validation models the variables shared with the external validation datasets comprised of two Scottish longitudinal cohort studies (n=162) and the OPUS trial, a randomised controlled trial of specialised assertive intervention versus standard treatment (n=578). Findings: The performance of prediction models was robust for the four 1-year outcomes of symptom remission (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0·703, 95% CI 0·664–0·742), social recovery (0·731, 0·697–0·765), vocational recovery (0·736, 0·702–0·771), and QoL (0·704, 0·667–0·742; p<0·0001 for all outcomes), on internal validation. We externally validated the outcomes of symptom remission (AUC 0·680, 95% CI 0·587–0·773), vocational recovery (0·867, 0·805–0·930), and QoL (0·679, 0·522–0·836) in the Scottish datasets, and symptom remission (0·616, 0·553–0·679), social recovery (0·573, 0·504–0·643), vocational recovery (0·660, 0·610–0·710), and QoL (0·556, 0·481–0·631) in the OPUS dataset. Interpretation: In our machine learning analysis, we showed that prediction models can reliably and prospectively identify poor remission and recovery outcomes at 1 year for patients with first-episode psychosis using baseline clinical variables at first clinical contact.

In this hypothesis-free, data-driven phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), we sought to assess possible associations of high body-mass index (BMI) with multiple disease outcomes. Methods: For this registry-based case-control PheWAS, we used genome-wide data available from the UK Biobank to construct a genetic risk score of 76 variants related to BMI. Eligible UK Biobank participants were aged 37–73 years during recruitment, were white British, were unrelated to each other, and had available genetic information. Disease outcomes from these participants were mapped to a phenotype code (phecode). Participants with a phecode of interest were recoded as cases, whereas participants without a phecode of interest or any codes under a parent phecode were classified as controls. We did a PheWAS to analyse possible associations between the BMI genetic risk score and a range of disease outcomes. Disease associations passing stringent correction for multiple testing (Bonferroni corrected threshold p<5·4 × 10−5, false discovery rate corrected p<0·0074) were assessed for causal association with use of inverse-variance weighted mendelian randomisation. We did sensitivity analyses to assess pleiotropy and stability of estimation with use of weighted median, weighted mode, Egger regression, and mendelian randomisation pleiotropy residual sum and outlier methods. Findings: Our study population comprised 337 536 UK Biobank participants, and analyses were done for 925 unique phecodes from 17 different disease categories. After Bonferroni correction, PheWAS identified that BMI genetic risk score was associated with hospital-diagnosed obesity and 58 other outcomes; 30 distinct disease associations were supported by the mendelian randomisation analyses. 30 distinct disease associations were supported by the mendelian randomisation analyses. In inverse-variance weighted mendelian randomisation, genetically determined BMI was associated with endocrine disorders (odds ratio per one SD or 4·1 kg/m2 higher BMI 2·72, 95% CI 2·33–3·29 for type 2 diabetes; 2·11, 1·62–2·76 for type 1 diabetes; and 1·46, 1·25–1·70 for hypothyroidism), circulatory diseases (1·96, 1·53–2·51 for phlebitis and thrombophlebitis; 1·89, 1·39–2·57 for cardiomegaly; 1·68, 1·35–2·09 for congestive heart failure; 1·55, 1·37–1·76 for hypertension; 1·31, 1·13–1·52 for ischaemic heart disease; and 1·25, 1·14–1·37 for cardiac dysrhythmias), and inflammatory or dermatological conditions (2·00, 1·72–2·23 for superficial cellulitis and abscess; 3·37, 2·17–5·25 for chronic ulcers of leg and foot; 4·99, 2·54–9·82 for gangrene; and 2·24, 1·53–3·28 for atopy). Mendelian randomisation analyses provided further support for a causal effect of BMI on renal failure, osteoarthrosis, neurological (insomnia and peripheral nerve disorders) and respiratory diseases (asthma and chronic bronchitis), structural problems (hernias and knee derangement), and chemotherapy treatment. Mendelian randomisation with Egger regression produced consistently wider CIs compared with those of other methods. 26 of 72 distinct diseases detected under false discovery rate correction produced consistent estimates across at least four mendelian randomisation methods, and consistent evidence across all five approaches was obtained for 14 diseases. Interpretation: Our data-driven approach identified a range of diseases as possibly affected by high BMI. This population-level screening approximated the accumulated consequences of high BMI, whereas the true effects might be more complex and vary by life stage. Our results highlight the importance of obesity prevention and effective management of obesity-related comorbidities.

We aimed to assess whether non-invasive diffusion-weighted MRI can distinguish between parkinsonian syndromes using an automated imaging approach. Methods: We did an international study at 17 MRI centres in Austria, Germany, and the USA. We used diffusion-weighted MRI from 1002 patients and the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (MDS-UPDRS III) to develop and validate disease-specific machine learning comparisons using 60 template regions and tracts of interest in Montreal Neurological Institute space between Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonism (multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy) and between multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. For each comparison, models were developed on a training and validation cohort and evaluated in an independent test cohort by quantifying the area under the curve (AUC) of receiving operating characteristic curves. The primary outcomes were free water and free-water-corrected fractional anisotropy across 60 different template regions. Findings: In the test cohort for disease-specific comparisons, the diffusion-weighted MRI plus MDS-UPDRS III model (Parkinson's disease vs atypical parkinsonism had an AUC 0·962; multiple system atrophy vs progressive supranuclear palsy AUC 0·897) and diffusion-weighted MRI only model had high AUCs (Parkinson's disease vs atypical parkinsonism AUC 0·955; multiple system atrophy vs progressive supranuclear palsy AUC 0·926), whereas the MDS-UPDRS III only models had significantly lower AUCs (Parkinson's disease vs atypical parkinsonism 0·775; multiple system atrophy vs progressive supranuclear palsy 0·582). These results indicate that a non-invasive imaging approach is capable of differentiating forms of parkinsonism comparable to current gold standard methods. Interpretations: This study provides an objective, validated, and generalisable imaging approach to distinguish different forms of parkinsonian syndromes using multisite diffusion-weighted MRI cohorts. The diffusion-weighted MRI method does not involve radioactive tracers, is completely automated, and can be collected in less than 12 min across 3T scanners worldwide. The use of this test could positively affect the clinical care of patients with Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism and reduce the number of misdiagnosed cases in clinical trials.

In this study, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of a smartphone-based cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention programme delivered via the social media platform WeChat (SMART-CR/SP). Methods: In this parallel-group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older with coronary heart disease who had received percutaneous coronary interventions from a large tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by block randomisation to either a 2-month intensive programme followed by a 4-month step-down phase of SMART-CR/SP or to usual care. In the SMART-CR/SP group, participants received comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention via WeChat. The usual care group received standard outpatient cardiology follow-up but without formal cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention. Assessments were done at baseline, 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months. The primary outcome was change in functional capacity from baseline, measured by 6-min walk distance, at 2 months and 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. Research personnel involved in assessments were blinded to group allocation. Adverse-event analysis was based on percentage of patients who discontinued the study owing to adverse events. SMART-CR/SP programme-related safety issues were also recorded. This study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, number ChiCTR-INR-16009598. Findings: Between Nov 17, 2016, and March 18, 2017, 312 patients (mean age 60·5 years [SD 9·2]), of whom 58 (19%) were female and 254 (81%) were male, were recruited and subsequently randomly assigned to SMART-CR/SP (n=156) or usual care (n=156). The improvement in 6-min walk distance at 2 months was significantly greater in the SMART-CR/SP group (from 489·2 m [99·4] at baseline to 539·1 m [68·0]) than in the control group (from 485·0 m [93·5] at baseline to 517·8 m [74.6]), with an adjusted mean difference of 20·64 m (95% CI 7·50–33·77; p=0·034). This improvement was maintained at 6 months (mean 6-min walk distance 543·4 m [67·5] in the SMART-CR/SP group vs 523·5 m [60·2] in the control group), with a mean between-group difference of 22·29 m (8·19–36·38; p=0·027). No adverse events or SMART-CR/SP programme-related safety issues were reported by participants during the study. Interpretation: SMART-CR/SP was found to be a cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention service model with high efficacy and accessibility and to be easy to use. These results justify the implementation of similar models of care on a broader scale. Funding: Curtin University. © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to develop and validate a three-dimensional (3D) deep-learning system using SDOCT volumes to detect glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Methods: We retrospectively collected a dataset including 4877 SDOCT volumes of optic disc cube for training (60%), testing (20%), and primary validation (20%) from electronic medical and research records at the Chinese University of Hong Kong Eye Centre (Hong Kong, China) and the Hong Kong Eye Hospital (Hong Kong, China). Residual network was used to build the 3D deep-learning system. Three independent datasets (two from Hong Kong and one from Stanford, CA, USA), including 546, 267, and 1231 SDOCT volumes, respectively, were used for external validation of the deep-learning system. Volumes were labelled as having or not having glaucomatous optic neuropathy according to the criteria of retinal nerve fibre layer thinning on reliable SDOCT images with position-correlated visual field defect. Heatmaps were generated for qualitative assessments. Findings: 6921 SDOCT volumes from 1 384 200 two-dimensional cross-sectional scans were studied. The 3D deep-learning system had an area under the receiver operation characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0·969 (95% CI 0·960–0·976), sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 83–93), specificity of 96% (92–99), and accuracy of 91% (89–93) in the primary validation, outperforming a two-dimensional deep-learning system that was trained on en face fundus images (AUROC 0·921 [0·905–0·937]; p<0·0001). The 3D deep-learning system performed similarly in the external validation datasets, with AUROCs of 0·893–0·897, sensitivities of 78–90%, specificities of 79–86%, and accuracies of 80–86%. The heatmaps of glaucomatous optic neuropathy showed that the learned features by the 3D deep-learning system used for detection of glaucomatous optic neuropathy were similar to those used by clinicians. Interpretation: The proposed 3D deep-learning system performed well in detection of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in both primary and external validations. Further prospective studies are needed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of incorporation of an artificial intelligence-based model for glaucoma screening.

The MyHeart Counts Cardiovascular Health Study is a longitudinal smartphone-based study with the aim of elucidating the determinants of cardiovascular health. We aimed to investigate the effect of four different physical activity coaching interventions on daily step count in a substudy of the MyHeart Counts Study. Methods: In this randomised, controlled crossover trial, we recruited adults (aged ≥18 years) in the USA with access to an iPhone smartphone (Apple, Cupertino, CA, USA; version 5S or newer) who had downloaded the MyHeart Counts app (version 2.0). After completion of a 1 week baseline period of interaction with the MyHeart Counts app, participants were randomly assigned to receive one of 24 permutations (four combinations of four 7 day interventions) in a crossover design using a random number generator built into the app. Interventions consisted of either daily prompts to complete 10 000 steps, hourly prompts to stand following 1 h of sitting, instructions to read the guidelines from the American Heart Association website, or e-coaching based upon the individual's personal activity patterns from the baseline week of data collection. Participants completed the trial in a free-living setting. Due to the nature of the interventions, participants could not be masked from the intervention. Investigators were not masked to intervention allocation. The primary outcome was change in mean daily step count from baseline for each of the four interventions, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat analysis set, which included all participants who had completed 7 days of baseline monitoring and at least 1 day of one of the four interventions. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03090321. Findings: Between Dec 12, 2016, and June 6, 2018, 2783 participants consented to enrol in the coaching study, of whom 1075 completed 7 days of baseline monitoring and at least 1 day of one of the four interventions and thus were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis set. 493 individuals completed the full set of assigned interventions. All four interventions significantly increased mean daily step count from baseline (mean daily step count 2914 [SE 74]): mean step count increased by 319 steps (75) for participants in the American Heart Association website prompt group (p<0·0001), 267 steps (74) for participants in the hourly stand prompt group (p=0·0003), 254 steps (74) for participants in the cluster-specific prompts group (p=0·0006), and by 226 steps (75) for participants in the 10 000 daily step prompt group (p=0·0026 vs baseline). Interpretation: Four smartphone-based physical activity coaching interventions significantly increased daily physical activity. These findings suggests that digital interventions delivered via a mobile app have the ability to increase short-term physical activity levels in a free-living cohort.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning algorithms versus health-care professionals in classifying diseases using medical imaging. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Ovid-MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index for studies published from Jan 1, 2012, to June 6, 2019. Studies comparing the diagnostic performance of deep learning models and health-care professionals based on medical imaging, for any disease, were included. We excluded studies that used medical waveform data graphics material or investigated the accuracy of image segmentation rather than disease classification. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data and constructed contingency tables to derive the outcomes of interest: sensitivity and specificity. Studies undertaking an out-of-sample external validation were included in a meta-analysis, using a unified hierarchical model. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018091176. Findings: Our search identified 31 587 studies, of which 82 (describing 147 patient cohorts) were included. 69 studies provided enough data to construct contingency tables, enabling calculation of test accuracy, with sensitivity ranging from 9·7% to 100·0% (mean 79·1%, SD 0·2) and specificity ranging from 38·9% to 100·0% (mean 88·3%, SD 0·1). An out-of-sample external validation was done in 25 studies, of which 14 made the comparison between deep learning models and health-care professionals in the same sample. Comparison of the performance between health-care professionals in these 14 studies, when restricting the analysis to the contingency table for each study reporting the highest accuracy, found a pooled sensitivity of 87·0% (95% CI 83·0–90·2) for deep learning models and 86·4% (79·9–91·0) for health-care professionals, and a pooled specificity of 92·5% (95% CI 85·1–96·4) for deep learning models and 90·5% (80·6–95·7) for health-care professionals. Interpretation: Our review found the diagnostic performance of deep learning models to be equivalent to that of health-care professionals. However, a major finding of the review is that few studies presented externally validated results or compared the performance of deep learning models and health-care professionals using the same sample. Additionally, poor reporting is prevalent in deep learning studies, which limits reliable interpretation of the reported diagnostic accuracy. New reporting standards that address specific challenges of deep learning could improve future studies, enabling greater confidence in the results of future evaluations of this promising technology.

We aimed to determine whether use of the programme improved adherence to health-related guidelines among Māori and Pasifika communities in New Zealand compared with a control group on a waiting list for the programme. Methods: The OL@-OR@ trial was a 12-week, two-arm, cluster-randomised controlled trial. A cluster was defined as any distinct location or setting in New Zealand where people with shared interests or contexts congregated, such as churches, sports clubs, and community groups. Members of a cluster were eligible to participate if they were aged 18 years or older, had regular access to a mobile device or computer, and had regular internet access. Clusters of Māori and of Pasifika (separately) were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the intervention or control condition. The intervention group received the OL@-OR@ mHealth programme (smartphone app and website). The control group received a control version of the app that only collected baseline and outcome data. The primary outcome was self-reported adherence to health-related guidelines, which were measured with a composite health behaviour score (of physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, and fruit and vegetable intake) at 12 weeks. The secondary outcomes were self-reported adherence to health-related behaviour guidelines at 4 weeks; self-reported bodyweight at 12 weeks; and holistic health and wellbeing status at 12 weeks, in all enrolled individuals in eligible clusters; and user engagement with the app, in individuals allocated to the intervention. Adverse events were not collected. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12617001484336. Findings: Between Jan 24 and Aug 14, 2018, we enrolled 337 Māori participants from 19 clusters and 389 Pasifika participants from 18 clusters (n=726 participants) in the intervention group and 320 Māori participants from 15 clusters and 405 Pasifika participants from 17 clusters (n=725 participants) in the control group. Of these participants, 227 (67%) Māori participants and 347 (89%) Pasifika participants (n=574 participants) in the intervention group and 281 (88%) Māori participants and 369 (91%) Pasifika participants (n=650 participants) in the control group completed the 12-week follow-up and were included in the final analysis. Relative to baseline, adherence to health-related behaviour guidelines increased at 12 weeks in both groups (315 [43%] of 726 participants at baseline to 329 [57%] of 574 participants in the intervention group; 331 [46%] of 725 participants to 369 [57%] of 650 participants in the control group); however, there was no significant difference between intervention and control groups in adherence at 12 weeks (odds ratio [OR] 1·13; 95% CI 0·84–1·52; p=0·42). Furthermore, the proportion of participants adhering to guidelines on physical activity (351 [61%] of 574 intervention group participants vs 407 [63%] of 650 control group participants; OR 1·03, 95% CI 0·73–1·45; p=0·88), smoking (434 [76%] participants vs 501 [77%] participants; 1·12, 0·67–1·87; p=0·66), alcohol consumption (518 [90%] participants vs 596 [92%] participants; 0·73, 0·37–1·44; p=0·36), and fruit and vegetable intake (194 [34%] participants vs 196 [30%] participants; 1·08, 0·79–1·49; p=0·64) did not differ between groups. We found no significant differences between the intervention and control groups in any secondary outcome. 147 (26%) intervention group participants engaged with the OL@-OR@ programme (ie, set at least one behaviour change goal online). Interpretation: The OL@-OR@ mobile health programme did not improve adherence to health-related behaviour guidelines amongst Māori and Pasifika individuals.
