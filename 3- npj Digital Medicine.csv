Current state-of-the-art methods quantify physical activity using “activity counts,” a measure which overlooks specific types of physical activities. We propose a walking recognition method for sub-second tri-axial accelerometer data, in which activity classification is based on the inherent features of walking: intensity, periodicity, and duration. We validate our method against 20 publicly available, annotated datasets on walking activity data collected at various body locations (thigh, waist, chest, arm, wrist). We demonstrate that our method can estimate walking periods with high sensitivity and specificity: average sensitivity ranged between 0.92 and 0.97 across various body locations, and average specificity for common daily activities was typically above 0.95. We also assess the method’s algorithmic fairness to demographic and anthropometric variables and measurement contexts (body location, environment).

The guidelines cover several aspects from the technical/digital specifications, e.g., recommended EEG derivations, to detailed sleep scoring rules accordingly to age. Automated sleep scoring systems have always largely exploited the standards as fundamental guidelines. In this context, deep learning has demonstrated better performance compared to classical machine learning. Our present work shows that a deep learning-based sleep scoring algorithm may not need to fully exploit the clinical knowledge or to strictly adhere to the AASM guidelines. Specifically, we demonstrate that U-Sleep, a state-of-the-art sleep scoring algorithm, can be strong enough to solve the scoring task even using clinically non-recommended or non-conventional derivations, and with no need to exploit information about the chronological age of the subjects. We finally strengthen a well-known finding that using data from multiple data centers always results in a better performing model compared with training on a single cohort. Indeed, we show that this latter statement is still valid even by increasing the size and the heterogeneity of the single data cohort.

This review is comprised of four case studies of DHTTs used throughout the lifecycle of medicinal products, starting from their development. These cases illustrate how the regulatory requirements of DHTTs used in medicines development are based on two European regulatory frameworks (medical device and the medicinal product regulations) and highlight the need for increased collaboration between various stakeholders, including regulators (medicines regulators and device bodies), pharmaceutical sponsors, manufacturers of devices and software, and academia. As illustrated in the examples, the complexity of the interactions is further increased by unique challenges related to DHTTs. These case studies are the main examples of DHTTs with a regulatory assessment thus far, providing an insight into the applicable current regulatory approach; they were selected by a group of authors, including regulatory specialists from pharmaceutical sponsors, technology experts, academic researchers and employees of the European Medicines Agency.

Cognitive and physical interventions are two promising non-pharmaceutical approaches used to enhance attention abilities, with combined approaches often being marketed to teachers, therapists, and parents typically without research validation. Here, we assessed the feasibility of incorporating an integrated, cognitive-physical, closed-loop video game (body-brain trainer or ‘BBT’) as an after-school program, and also evaluated if there were attention benefits following its use. Twenty-two children (7–12 years of age) with a range of attention abilities were recruited to participate in this proof of concept, single-arm, longitudinal study (24 sessions over 8 weeks, ~30 min/day). We interrogated attention abilities through a parent survey of their child’s behaviors, in addition to objective performance-based and neural measures of attention. Here we observed 95% compliance as well as, significant improvements on the parent-based reports of inattention and on cognitive tests and neural measures of attention that were comparable in scale to previous work. Exploratory measures of other cognitive control abilities and physical fitness also showed similar improvement, with exploratory evaluation of retained benefits on the primary attention-related outcomes being present 1-year later. Lastly, there was no correlation between the baseline parent-rated inattention score and the improvement on the primary task-based measures of attention, suggesting that intervention-based benefits were not solely attained by those who stood the most to gain. These pilot findings warrant future research to replicate and extend these findings. © 2023, The Author(s).","Closed-loop; Cognitive tests; Longitudinal study; Performance based; Pilot studies; Proof of concept; Research validation; School project; Teachers'; Video-games; article; attention; brain; case report; child; clinical article; executive function; exploratory research; feasibility study; female; fitness; human; human experiment; longitudinal study; male; outcome assessment; pilot study; proof of concept; school child; video game; Human computer interaction","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153276121"

With personal health data, this re-identification risk may be considered a double-crossing of patients’ trust. Herein, we present a new method to generate synthetic data of individual granularity while holding on to patients’ privacy. Developed for sensitive biomedical data, the method is patient-centric as it uses a local model to generate random new synthetic data, called an “avatar data”, for each initial sensitive individual. This method, compared with 2 other synthetic data generation techniques (Synthpop, CT-GAN), is applied to real health data with a clinical trial and a cancer observational study to evaluate the protection it provides while retaining the original statistical information. Compared to Synthpop and CT-GAN, the Avatar method shows a similar level of signal maintenance while allowing to compute additional privacy metrics. In the light of distance-based privacy metrics, each individual produces an avatar simulation that is on average indistinguishable from 12 other generated avatar simulations for the clinical trial and 24 for the observational study. Data transformation using the Avatar method both preserves, the evaluation of the treatment’s effectiveness with similar hazard ratios for the clinical trial (original HR = 0.49 [95% CI, 0.39–0.63] vs. avatar HR = 0.40 [95% CI, 0.31–0.52]) and the classification properties for the observational study (original AUC = 99.46 (s.e. 0.25) vs. avatar AUC = 99.84 (s.e. 0.12)).

With such systems informing future high-stakes decisions such as whether to credential surgeons and grant them the privilege to operate on patients, it is critical that they treat all surgeons fairly. However, it remains an open question whether surgical AI systems exhibit bias against surgeon sub-cohorts, and, if so, whether such bias can be mitigated. Here, we examine and mitigate the bias exhibited by a family of surgical AI systems—SAIS—deployed on videos of robotic surgeries from three geographically-diverse hospitals (USA and EU). We show that SAIS exhibits an underskilling bias, erroneously downgrading surgical performance, and an overskilling bias, erroneously upgrading surgical performance, at different rates across surgeon sub-cohorts. To mitigate such bias, we leverage a strategy —TWIX—which teaches an AI system to provide a visual explanation for its skill assessment that otherwise would have been provided by human experts. We show that whereas baseline strategies inconsistently mitigate algorithmic bias, TWIX can effectively mitigate the underskilling and overskilling bias while simultaneously improving the performance of these AI systems across hospitals. We discovered that these findings carry over to the training environment where we assess medical students’ skills today. Our study is a critical prerequisite to the eventual implementation of AI-augmented global surgeon credentialing programs, ensuring that all surgeons are treated fairly. © 2023, The Author(s).","Robotic surgery; Students; Algorithmics; Artificial intelligence systems; Human expert; Human visual; Intra-operative; Medical students; Performance; Robotics surgery; Skill assessment; Student skills; accreditation; algorithm bias; article; artificial intelligence; controlled study; human; medical student; robot assisted surgery; skill; surgeon; videorecording; Hospitals","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151396353"

However, patient privacy has become a major concern that limits data sharing across hospital settings and subsequently hinders the advances in AI. Synthetic data, which benefits from the development and proliferation of generative models, has served as a promising substitute for real patient EHR data. However, the current generative models are limited as they only generate single type of clinical data for a synthetic patient, i.e., either continuous-valued or discrete-valued. To mimic the nature of clinical decision-making which encompasses various data types/sources, in this study, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) entitled EHR-M-GAN that simultaneously synthesizes mixed-type timeseries EHR data. EHR-M-GAN is capable of capturing the multidimensional, heterogeneous, and correlated temporal dynamics in patient trajectories. We have validated EHR-M-GAN on three publicly-available intensive care unit databases with records from a total of 141,488 unique patients, and performed privacy risk evaluation of the proposed model. EHR-M-GAN has demonstrated its superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks for synthesizing clinical timeseries with high fidelity, while addressing the limitations regarding data types and dimensionality in the current generative models. Notably, prediction models for outcomes of intensive care performed significantly better when training data was augmented with the addition of EHR-M-GAN-generated timeseries. EHR-M-GAN may have use in developing AI algorithms in resource-limited settings, lowering the barrier for data acquisition while preserving patient privacy. © 2023, The Author(s).","Data acquisition; Generative adversarial networks; Intensive care units; Records management; 'current; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Artificial intelligent; Datatypes; Electronic health; Generative model; Health records; Intelligent applications; Mixed type; Patient privacies; adult; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; clinical decision making; electronic health record; female; human; intensive care; intensive care unit; major clinical study; male; prediction; privacy; resource limited setting; risk assessment; Decision making","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160207635"

We study 19,847 adult ED visits, divided into training (75%), validation (12.5%), and a chronologically sequential held-out test set (12.5%).

To address this gap, we investigate four potential strategies for AI model deployment and physician collaboration to determine their potential impact on diagnostic accuracy. As a case study, we examine an AI model trained to identify findings of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on chest X-ray images. While this model outperforms physicians at identifying findings of ARDS, there are several reasons why fully automated ARDS detection may not be optimal nor feasible in practice. Among several collaboration strategies tested, we find that if the AI model first reviews the chest X-ray and defers to a physician if it is uncertain, this strategy achieves a higher diagnostic accuracy (0.869, 95% CI 0.835–0.903) compared to a strategy where a physician reviews a chest X-ray first and defers to an AI model if uncertain (0.824, 95% CI 0.781–0.862), or strategies where the physician reviews the chest X-ray alone (0.808, 95% CI 0.767–0.85) or the AI model reviews the chest X-ray alone (0.847, 95% CI 0.806–0.887).

These organizations may benefit from a DHI assessment framework that is both rigorous and rapid. Here we propose a framework to assess Evidence in Digital health for EFfectiveness of INterventions with Evaluative Depth (Evidence DEFINED). Designed for real-world use, the Evidence DEFINED Quick Start Guide may help streamline DHI assessment. A checklist is provided summarizing high-priority evidence considerations in digital health. Evidence-to-recommendation guidelines are proposed, specifying degrees of adoption that may be appropriate for a range of evidence quality levels. Evidence DEFINED differs from prior frameworks in its inclusion of unique elements designed for rigor and speed. Rigor is increased by addressing three gaps in prior frameworks. First, prior frameworks are not adapted adequately to address evidence considerations that are unique to digital health. Second, prior frameworks do not specify evidence quality criteria requiring increased vigilance for DHIs in the current regulatory context. Third, extant frameworks rarely leverage established, robust methodologies that were developed for non-digital interventions. Speed is achieved in the Evidence DEFINED Framework through screening optimization and deprioritization of steps that may have limited value. The primary goals of Evidence DEFINED are to a) facilitate standardized, rapid, rigorous DHI evidence assessment in organizations and b) guide digital health solutions providers who wish to generate evidence that drives DHI adoption. © 2023, The Author(s).","'current; Health interventions; Health systems; Optimisations; Quality criteria; Quality levels; Quick starts; Real-world; Trade organizations; Unique element","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160914419"

These AI algorithms model input-output relationships of a system that, in many cases, exhibits complex nature and personalization requirements. A particular example is cuffless blood pressure estimation using wearable bioimpedance. However, these algorithms need training over significant amount of ground truth data. In the context of biomedical applications, collecting ground truth data, particularly at the personalized level is challenging, burdensome, and in some cases infeasible. Our objective is to establish physics-informed neural network (PINN) models for physiological time series data that would use minimal ground truth information to extract complex cardiovascular information. We achieve this by building Taylor’s approximation for gradually changing known cardiovascular relationships between input and output (e.g., sensor measurements to blood pressure) and incorporating this approximation into our proposed neural network training. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through a case study: continuous cuffless BP estimation from time series bioimpedance data. We show that by using PINNs over the state-of-the-art time series models tested on the same datasets, we retain high correlations (systolic: 0.90, diastolic: 0.89) and low error (systolic: 1.3 ± 7.6 mmHg, diastolic: 0.6 ± 6.4 mmHg) while reducing the amount of ground truth training data on average by a factor of 15.

Currently, BStim is primarily used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson’s, though indications are expanding to include neuropsychiatric disorders like depression and schizophrenia. Traditional BStim systems are “open-loop” and deliver constant electrical stimulation based on manually-determined parameters. Advancements in BStim have enabled development of “closed-loop” systems that analyze neural biomarkers (e.g., local field potentials in the sub-thalamic nucleus) and adjust electrical modulation in a dynamic, patient-specific, and energy efficient manner. These closed-loop systems enable real-time, context-specific stimulation adjustment to reduce symptom burden. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a vital component in designing these closed-loop systems as ML models can predict / identify presence of disease symptoms based on neural activity and adaptively learn to modulate stimulation. We queried the US National Library of Medicine PubMed database to understand the role of ML in developing closed-loop BStim systems to treat epilepsy, movement disorders, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Both neural and non-neural network ML algorithms have successfully been leveraged to create closed-loop systems that perform comparably to open-loop systems. For disorders in which the underlying neural pathophysiology is relatively well understood (e.g., Parkinson’s, essential tremor), most work has involved refining ML models that can classify neural signals as aberrant or normal. The same is seen for epilepsy, where most current research has focused on identifying optimal ML model design and integrating closed-loop systems into existing devices. For neuropsychiatric disorders, where the underlying pathologic neural circuitry is still being investigated, research is focused on identifying biomarkers (e.g., local field potentials from brain nuclei) that ML models can use to identify onset of symptoms and stratify severity of disease. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Biomarkers; Brain; Closed loop systems; Diseases; Electrophysiology; Energy efficiency; Machine learning; Real time systems; Brain stimulation; Closed-loop; Closed-loop system; Local field potentials; Machine learning applications; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Movement disorders; Neuropsychiatric disorder; Stimulation systems; brain depth stimulation; depression; epilepsy; essential tremor; futurology; Gilles de la Tourette syndrome; human; local field potential; machine learning; obsessive compulsive disorder; Parkinson disease; Review; schizophrenia; Neurons","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158051124"

Synthetic data, i.e., artificial but realistic electronic health records, could overcome the drought that is troubling the healthcare sector. Deep neural network architectures, in particular, have shown an incredible ability to learn from complex data sets and generate large amounts of unseen data points with the same statistical properties as the training data. Here, we present a generative neural network model that can create synthetic health records with realistic timelines. These clinical trajectories are generated on a per-patient basis and are represented as linear-sequence graphs of clinical events over time.

Different sensing technologies can be used as a surrogate measure of pain to overcome these challenges. The objective of this review is to summarise and synthesise the published literature to: (a) identify relevant non-invasive physiological sensing technologies that can be used for the assessment of human pain, (b) describe the analytical tools used in artificial intelligence (AI) to decode pain data collected from sensing technologies, and (c) describe the main implications in the application of these technologies. A literature search was conducted in July 2022 to query PubMed, Web of Sciences, and Scopus. Papers published between January 2013 and July 2022 are considered. Forty-eight studies are included in this literature review. Two main sensing technologies (neurological and physiological) are identified in the literature. The sensing technologies and their modality (unimodal or multimodal) are presented. The literature provided numerous examples of how different analytical tools in AI have been applied to decode pain. This review identifies different non-invasive sensing technologies, their analytical tools, and the implications for their use. There are significant opportunities to leverage multimodal sensing and deep learning to improve accuracy of pain monitoring systems. This review also identifies the need for analyses and datasets that explore the inclusion of neural and physiological information together.

A Health Management Module in the eHealth App introduced new functions to record blood pressure, blood sugar, and heart rate, and downloading and sharing records. This study aims to compare the level of glycaemic control between users of the eHealth App and non-users. Type 2 diabetes patients who have joined the eHRSS with existing haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level records are recruited. Correlations between predictors and optimal HbA1c control (<7%) are examined using logistic regression analyses. A total of 109,823 participants are included, with 76,356 non-users of eHealth App, 31,723 users of eHealth App, and 1744 users of the eHealth Management Module together with the App. We collect HbA1c values from Jan 2021 to May 2022, and they are 6 months after the use of the App on average. Users of the eHealth Management Module are found to have more optimal HbA1c levels across all subgroups, with the strongest effect observed in younger females (aOR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.27–2.17). eHealth App usage is also positively associated with optimal HbA1c levels, particularly amongst younger females (aOR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.08–1.26). Overall, users of eHealth App and eHealth Management Module demonstrate more optimal HbA1c levels when compared with non-users, particularly among younger adults and females. These findings support its potential adoption in diabetes patients.

This was a single-arm pilot implementational study of remote digital postoperative wound monitoring across two tertiary care hospitals in the UK (IDEAL stage 2b, clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05069103). Adults undergoing abdominal surgery were recruited and received a smartphone-delivered wound assessment tool for 30-days postoperatively. Patients received 30-day postoperative follow-up, including the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ). A thematic mixed-methods approach was used, according to the WHO framework for monitoring and evaluating digital health interventions. 200 patients were enroled, of whom 115 (57.5%) underwent emergency surgical procedures. Overall, the 30-day SSI rate was 16.5% (n = 33/200), with 72.7% (n = 24) diagnosed post-discharge. Usage of the intervention was 83.0% (n = 166/200), with subsequently 74.1% (n = 123/166) TUQ completion.

In this study, we conduct an in-depth investigation and analysis of definitions, clinical trials, commercial products, and the regulatory status related to DTx using published literature, ClinicalTrials.gov, and web pages of regulatory and private organizations in several countries. Subsequently, we suggest the necessity and considerations for international agreements on the definition and characteristics of DTx, focusing on the commercialization characteristics. In addition, we discuss the status and considerations of clinical research, key technology factors, and the direction of regulatory developments. In conclusion, for the successful settlement of DTx, real-world evidence-based validation should be strengthened by establishing a cooperative system between researchers, manufacturers, and governments, and there should be effective technologies and regulatory systems for overcoming engagement barriers of DTx. © 2023, The Author(s).","Websites; Clinical application; Clinical trial; Commercial products; Commercialisation; Digital technologies; Investigation and analysis; Regulatory frameworks; Regulatory status; Research and development; Therapeutic techniques; article; clinical research; government; human; organization; Clinical research","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150159936"

Therefore, this prospective observational study aimed to observe how AI affected the reading times of radiologists in the daily interpretation of CXRs. Radiologists who agreed to have the reading times of their CXR interpretations collected from September to December 2021 were recruited. Reading time was defined as the duration in seconds from opening CXRs to transcribing the image by the same radiologist. As commercial AI software was integrated for all CXRs, the radiologists could refer to AI results for 2 months (AI-aided period). During the other 2 months, the radiologists were automatically blinded to the AI results (AI-unaided period). A total of 11 radiologists participated, and 18,680 CXRs were included. Total reading times were significantly shortened with AI use, compared to no use (13.3 s vs. 14.8 s, p < 0.001). When there was no abnormality detected by AI, reading times were shorter with AI use (mean 10.8 s vs. 13.1 s, p < 0.001). However, if any abnormality was detected by AI, reading times did not differ according to AI use (mean 18.6 s vs. 18.4 s, p = 0.452). Reading times increased as abnormality scores increased, and a more significant increase was observed with AI use (coefficient 0.09 vs. 0.06, p < 0.001). Therefore, the reading times of CXRs among radiologists were influenced by the availability of AI. Overall reading times shortened when radiologists referred to AI; however, abnormalities detected by AI could lengthen reading times. © 2023, The Author(s).","Radiography; Chest radiographs; Intelligence software; Observational study; Prospectives; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; atelectasis; cardiomegaly; clinical practice; computer assisted diagnosis; controlled study; data interpretation; female; fibrosis; human; lung consolidation; lung nodule; major clinical study; male; middle aged; observational study; patient information; pleura effusion; pneumoperitoneum; pneumothorax; radiologist; thorax radiography; time; work experience; Artificial intelligence","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85156207603"

However, the impact of night-to-night variability in OSA severity on key cardiovascular outcomes such as hypertension is unknown. Thus, the primary aim of this study is to determine the effects of night-to-night variability in OSA severity on hypertension likelihood. This study uses in-home monitoring of 15,526 adults with ~180 nights per participant with an under-mattress sleep sensor device, plus ~30 repeat blood pressure measures. OSA severity is defined from the mean estimated apnea–hypopnoea index (AHI) over the ~6-month recording period for each participant. Night-to-night variability in severity is determined from the standard deviation of the estimated AHI across recording nights. Uncontrolled hypertension is defined as mean systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or mean diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg. Regression analyses are performed adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index. A total of 12,287 participants (12% female) are included in the analyses. Participants in the highest night-to-night variability quartile within each OSA severity category, have a 50–70% increase in uncontrolled hypertension likelihood versus the lowest variability quartile, independent of OSA severity. This study demonstrates that high night-to-night variability in OSA severity is a predictor of uncontrolled hypertension, independent of OSA severity. These findings have important implications for the identification of which OSA patients are most at risk of cardiovascular harm. © 2023, The Author(s).","Blood; Regression analysis; Sleep research; Apnea-hypopnea indices; Body mass; Diastolic blood pressures; Home monitoring; Mass index; Obstructive sleep apnea; Sensor device; Sleep apnea; Standard deviation; Systolic blood pressure; adult; age; aged; apnea hypopnea index; Article; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure variability; body mass; controlled study; disease severity; female; home monitoring; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; mediation analysis; night; recording; regression analysis; risk factor; sex; sleep disordered breathing; systolic blood pressure; Blood pressure","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151437345"

However, personalizing predictions to a specific event type and time interval is more challenging. We demonstrate an explainable deep learning model that predicts the time-specific risk separately for all-cause death, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and revascularization directly from MPI and 15 clinical features. We train and test the model internally using 10-fold hold-out cross-validation (n = 20,418) and externally validate it in three separate sites (n = 13,988) with MACE follow-ups for a median of 3.1 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.6, 3.6). We evaluate the model using the cumulative dynamic area under receiver operating curve (cAUC). The best model performance in the external cohort is observed for short-term prediction – in the first six months after the scan, mean cAUC for ACS and all-cause death reaches 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75, 0.77) and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.79), respectively. The model outperforms conventional perfusion abnormality measures at all time points for the prediction of death in both internal and external validations, with improvement increasing gradually over time. Individualized patient explanations are visualized using waterfall plots, which highlight the contribution degree and direction for each feature. This approach allows the derivation of individual event probability as a function of time as well as patient- and event-specific risk explanations that may help draw attention to modifiable risk factors. Such a method could help present post-scan risk assessments to the patient and foster shared decision-making. © 2023, The Author(s).","Decision making; Deep learning; Forecasting; Cardiovascular event; Confidence interval; Coronary syndromes; Event Types; Event-specific; Learning models; Myocardial perfusion; Perfusion imaging; Risks assessments; Time interval; acute coronary syndrome; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; cardiovascular disease; clinical feature; controlled study; deep learning; female; follow up; heart muscle revascularization; hold out cross validation; human; major clinical study; male; myocardial perfusion imaging; prediction; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; time; Risk assessment","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158977624"

Majority of participants (67.6%) continued to remain engaged in the study after 43 weeks. Unsupervised clustering of participants’ study apps and Fitbit usage data showed 3 distinct engagement subgroups for each data stream. We found: (i) the least engaged group had the highest depression severity (4 PHQ8 points higher) across all data streams; (ii) the least engaged group (completed 4 bi-weekly surveys) took significantly longer to respond to survey notifications (3.8 h more) and were 5 years younger compared to the most engaged group (completed 20 bi-weekly surveys); and (iii) a considerable proportion (44.6%) of the participants who stopped completing surveys after 8 weeks continued to share passive Fitbit data for significantly longer (average 42 weeks). Additionally, multivariate survival models showed participants’ age, ownership and brand of smartphones, and recruitment sites to be associated with retention in the study.

The Predictive Approaches to Treatment Effect Heterogeneity (PATH) statement focused on baseline risk as a robust predictor of treatment effect and provided guidance on risk-based assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity in a randomized controlled trial. The aim of this study is to extend this approach to the observational setting using a standardized scalable framework. The proposed framework consists of five steps: (1) definition of the research aim, i.e., the population, the treatment, the comparator and the outcome(s) of interest; (2) identification of relevant databases; (3) development of a prediction model for the outcome(s) of interest; (4) estimation of relative and absolute treatment effect within strata of predicted risk, after adjusting for observed confounding; (5) presentation of the results. We demonstrate our framework by evaluating heterogeneity of the effect of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on three efficacy and nine safety outcomes across three observational databases. We provide a publicly available R software package for applying this framework to any database mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. In our demonstration, patients at low risk of acute myocardial infarction receive negligible absolute benefits for all three efficacy outcomes, though they are more pronounced in the highest risk group, especially for acute myocardial infarction. Our framework allows for the evaluation of differential treatment effects across risk strata, which offers the opportunity to consider the benefit-harm trade-off between alternative treatments. © 2023, The Author(s).","Cardiology; Economic and social effects; Patient treatment; Risk assessment; Risk perception; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; thiazide diuretic agent; Acute myocardial infarction; Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; Common data model; Prediction modelling; R softwares; Randomized controlled trial; Risk groups; Risk-based assessments; Thiazides; Treatment effects; acute heart infarction; acute kidney failure; angioneurotic edema; Article; billing and claims; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; Charlson Comorbidity Index; conceptual framework; controlled study; coughing; cross validation; data base; drug efficacy; drug safety; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; heart failure; high risk population; hospitalization; human; hyperkalemia; hypertension; hypokalemia; hyponatremia; hypotension; kidney disease; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; medicaid; medical history; prediction; risk assessment; risk reduction; Database systems","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151471885"

The estimated incidence of vision loss at 5 years was 1535 per 100,000 in the AI-screened group compared to 1625 per 100,000 in the ECP group, leading to a modelled risk difference of 90 per 100,000.

Vision loss at 5 years remained lower in the AI-screened group compared to the ECP group, in a wide range of parameters including optimistic estimates biased toward ECP.

AI-based language analyses, having recently shown promise in cross-sectional (between-community) well-being assessments, may offer a way to more accurately longitudinally predict community-level overdose mortality. Here, we develop and evaluate, TrOP (Transformer for Opiod Prediction), a model for community-specific trend projection that uses community-specific social media language along with past opioid-related mortality data to predict future changes in opioid-related deaths. TOP builds on recent advances in sequence modeling, namely transformer networks, to use changes in yearly language on Twitter and past mortality to project the following year’s mortality rates by county. Trained over five years and evaluated over the next two years TrOP demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting future county-specific opioid trends. A model built using linear auto-regression and traditional socioeconomic data gave 7% error (MAPE) or within 2.93 deaths per 100,000 people on average; our proposed architecture was able to forecast yearly death rates with less than half that error: 3% MAPE and within 1.15 per 100,000 people. © 2023, The Author(s).","Modeling languages; Population statistics; Social networking (online); opiate; Auto regression; Community wells; Language analysis; Mortality rate; Opioids; Sequence models; Social media; State of the art; Trend projections; Well being; accuracy; age; aged; Article; artificial intelligence; data availability; deep learning; educational status; female; human; language; machine learning; male; mortality; mortality rate; prediction; social media; socioeconomics; statistical model; Forecasting","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150052803"

We developed ECG-based machine learning models to predict risk of mortality among patients presenting to an emergency department or hospital for any reason. Using the 12-lead ECG traces and measurements from 1,605,268 ECGs from 748,773 healthcare episodes of 244,077 patients (2007–2020) in Alberta, Canada, we developed and validated ResNet-based Deep Learning (DL) and gradient boosting-based XGBoost (XGB) models to predict 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year mortality. The models for 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year mortality were trained on 146,173, 141,072, and 111,020 patients and evaluated on 97,144, 89,379, and 55,650 patients, respectively.

Thus, it is a public health priority to provide these children with early preventive interventions that are accessible on a large scale, adapted to their needs, and effective in supporting their mental health. Here we report a randomized control trial to test the efficacy of the REThink online therapeutic game, as compared with a Care as Usual (CAU) control group in the prevention of mental illness in maltreated children. Out of 439 children aged 8–12 that were recruited, 294 children with self-reported maltreatment histories were included in the current study, and were allocated, 146 participants in the REThink group and 148 participants in the CAU group. All children completed pre- and post-intervention assessments measuring mental health, emotion regulation, and irrational cognitions. We also tested potential moderators for these effects, such as the severity of CM and the security of parent attachment. Our results show that children receiving the REThink game intervention outperform the CAU group at post-test, showing a significantly lower level of emotional problems, mental health difficulties, use of maladaptive emotion-regulation strategies such as catastrophizing, rumination, and self-blame, and irrational cognitions. Moreover, children with higher CM severity benefit the most from the REThink game, while children with lower parent attachment security benefit the least. Future research is needed, to investigate the long-term efficacy of the REThink game in promoting the mental health of children exposed to CM. © 2023, The Author(s).","'current; Control groups; Emotion regulations; Health priorities; Large-scales; Mental health; Mental illness; Post interventions; Post test; Randomized control trials; Diseases","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161350238"

This study uses a Life Cycle Assessment with retrospective clinical data from Stanford Health Care (SHC) in 2019–2021 to determine the environmental emissions associated with in-person and virtual clinic visits. SHC saw 13% increase in clinic visits, but due to the rise in telemedicine services, the Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHGs) from these visits decreased 36% between 2019 and 2021. Telemedicine (phone and video appointments) helped SHC avoid approximately 17,000 metric tons of GHGs in 2021. Some departments, such as psychiatry and cancer achieved greater GHG reductions, as they were able to perform more virtual visits.

Very little is known about the benefit of internet-based and mobile-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (IM-CBT) on physical outcomes and its reciprocal interactions with psychiatric outcomes, the active therapeutic elements, and effect moderators among people with major chronic medical conditions. In this systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42022265738), CINAHL of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science are systematically searched up to 1 June 2022, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IM-CBT against non-CBT control condition(s) among people with chronic disease(s). Primary outcomes include improvements in psychiatric symptoms (depressive, anxiety, PTSD symptoms, general psychological distress) from baseline to post-intervention and follow-ups. Secondary outcomes include improvements in physical distress (physical symptoms, functional impairment, self-rated ill health, objective physiological dysfunction). Among 44 RCTs (5077 patients with seven different chronic diseases), IM-CBT improves depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and general psychological distress at post-intervention and across follow-ups, and improves physical distress and functional impairment at post-intervention. Preliminary evidence suggests that behavioral modification and problem-solving could be necessary components to reduce psychiatric symptoms in IM-CBT, whereas cognitive restructuring, psychoeducation, and mindfulness elements relate to reduced physical distress. IM-CBT shows stronger benefits in chronic pain, cancer, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease, relative to other conditions. Changes in psychiatric symptoms and physical distress prospectively predict each other over time. IM-CBT is an effective intervention for comprehensive symptom management among people with chronic diseases. © 2023, The Author(s).","Disease control; Patient treatment; Chronic disease; Cognitive-behavioral therapies; Comorbidities; Condition; Internet based; Meta-analysis; Post interventions; Psychological distress; Randomized controlled trial; Systematic Review; Diseases","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158012366"

Brain CT images (12,663 slices from 296 patients) were evaluated by nine reviewers belonging to one of the three subgroups (non-radiologist physicians, n = 3; board-certified radiologists, n = 3; and neuroradiologists, n = 3) with and without the aid of our AI algorithm. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were compared between AI-unassisted and AI-assisted interpretations using the chi-square test. Brain CT interpretation with AI assistance results in significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than that without AI assistance (0.9703 vs. 0.9471, p < 0.0001, patient-wise). Among the three subgroups of reviewers, non-radiologist physicians demonstrate the greatest improvement in diagnostic accuracy for brain CT interpretation with AI assistance compared to that without AI assistance. For board-certified radiologists, the diagnostic accuracy for brain CT interpretation is significantly higher with AI assistance than without AI assistance. For neuroradiologists, although brain CT interpretation with AI assistance results in a trend for higher diagnostic accuracy compared to that without AI assistance, the difference does not reach statistical significance.

In this study, we establish a smartphone app that assesses patient bowel preparation using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction system trained on labeled photographs of feces in the toilet and evaluate its impact on bowel preparation quality in colonoscopy outpatients. We conduct a prospective, single-masked, multicenter randomized clinical trial, enrolling outpatients who own a smartphone and are scheduled for a colonoscopy. We screen 578 eligible patients and randomize 524 in a 1:1 ratio to the control or AI-driven app group for bowel preparation. The study endpoints are the percentage of patients with adequate bowel preparation and the total BBPS score, compliance with dietary restrictions and purgative instructions, polyp detection rate, and adenoma detection rate (secondary). The prediction system has an accuracy of 95.15%, a specificity of 97.25%, and an area under the curve of 0.98 in the test dataset. In the full analysis set (n = 500), adequate preparation is significantly higher in the AI-driven app group (88.54 vs. 65.59%; P < 0.001). The mean BBPS score is 6.74 ± 1.25 in the AI-driven app group and 5.97 ± 1.81 in the control group (P < 0.001). The rates of compliance with dietary restrictions (93.68 vs. 83.81%, P = 0.001) and purgative instructions (96.05 vs. 84.62%, P < 0.001) are significantly higher in the AI-driven app group, as is the rate of additional purgative intake (26.88 vs. 17.41%, P = 0.011).

We aimed to characterize and map digital health ecosystems of all 54 countries in Africa in the context of endemic infectious and non-communicable diseases (ID and NCD). We performed a cross-national ecological analysis of digital health ecosystems using 20-year data from the World Bank, UN Economic Commission for Africa, World Health Organization, and Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were used to characterize ecological correlations between exposure (technology characteristics) and outcome (IDs and NCDs incidence/mortality) variables. Weighted linear combination model was used as the decision rule, combining disease burden, technology access, and economy, to explain, rank, and map digital health ecosystems of a given country. The perspective of our analysis was to support government decision-making. The 20-year trend showed that technology characteristics have been steadily growing in Africa, including internet access, mobile cellular and fixed broadband subscriptions, high-technology manufacturing, GDP per capita, and adult literacy, while many countries have been overwhelmed by a double burden of IDs and NCDs. Inverse correlations exist between technology characteristics and ID burdens, such as fixed broadband subscription and incidence of tuberculosis and malaria, or GDP per capita and incidence of tuberculosis and malaria. Based on our models, countries that should prioritize digital health investments were South Africa, Nigeria, and Tanzania for HIV; Nigeria, South Africa, and Democratic Republic of the Congo (DROC) for tuberculosis; DROC, Nigeria, and Uganda for malaria; and Egypt, Nigeria, and Ethiopia for endemic NCDs including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, and malignancies. Countries such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola, and Mozambique were also highly affected by endemic IDs. By mapping digital health ecosystems in Africa, this study provides strategic guidance about where governments should prioritize digital health technology investments that require preliminary analysis of country-specific contexts to bring about sustainable health and economic returns. Building digital infrastructure should be a key part of economic development programs in countries with high disease burdens to ensure more equitable health outcomes. Though infrastructure developments alongside digital health technologies are the responsibility of governments, global health initiatives can cultivate digital health interventions substantially by bridging knowledge and investment gaps, both through technology transfer for local production and negotiation of prices for large-scale deployment of the most impactful digital health technologies. © 2023, The Author(s).","Decision making; Digital devices; Diseases; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Mapping; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wearable technology; Digital health ecosystems; Disease burdens; Fixed broadbands; Health technology; Infectious disease; Nigeria; Non-communicable disease; Per capita; Technology characteristics; United Nations; Africa; Angola; Article; cardiovascular disease; Democratic Republic Congo; diabetes mellitus; digital technology; disease burden; economic development; Egypt; endemic disease; Ethiopia; geographic mapping; global health; gross national product; health care system; health literacy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; incidence; infection; internet access; Kenya; malaria; malignant neoplasm; Mozambique; Nigeria; non communicable disease; respiratory tract disease; South Africa; Tanzania; tuberculosis; Uganda; Zambia; Zimbabwe; Investments","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160209581"

However, whether circadian disruption can predict the onset of AF in the general population remains largely unknown. We aim to investigate the association of accelerometer-measured circadian rest-activity rhythm (CRAR, the most prominent circadian rhythm in humans) with the risk of AF, and examine joint associations and potential interactions of CRAR and genetic susceptibility with AF incidence. We include 62,927 white British participants of UK Biobank without AF at baseline. CRAR characteristics, including amplitude (strength), acrophase (timing of peak activity), pseudo-F (robustness), and mesor (height), are derived by applying an extended cosine model. Genetic risk is assessed with polygenic risk scores. The outcome is the incidence of AF. During a median follow-up of 6.16 years, 1920 participants developed AF. Low amplitude [hazard ratio (HR): 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.25–1.58], delayed acrophase (HR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10–1.39), and low mesor (HR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.21–1.52), but not low pseudo-F, are significantly associated with a higher risk of AF. No significant interactions between CRAR characteristics and genetic risk are observed. Joint association analyses reveal that participants with unfavourable CRAR characteristics and high genetic risk yield the highest risk of incident AF. These associations are robust after controlling for multiple testing and in a series of sensitivity analyses. Accelerometer-measured CRAR abnormalities, characterized by decreased strength and height, and later timing of peak activity of circadian rhythm, are associated with a higher risk of AF in the general population. © 2023, The Author(s).","Accelerometers; Diseases; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Atrial fibrillation; Biobanks; Circadian disruptions; Circadian rhythms; Confidence interval; General population; Genetic risks; Genetic susceptibility; Hazard ratio; Risk score; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; atrial fibrillation; Caucasian; circadian rhythm sleep disorder; coffee consumption; controlled study; dyslipidemia; false discovery rate; female; follow up; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic risk score; genetic susceptibility; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; obesity; people by smoking status; sleep time; tea consumption; Townsend deprivation index; United Kingdom; Association reactions","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149760332"

We compare effectiveness of AR-based and conventional rehabilitation in patients after rotator cuff repair (RCR). This study randomly allocates 115 participants who underwent RCR to digital healthcare rehabilitation group (DR group) and conventional rehabilitation group (CR group). The DR group performs AR-based home exercises using UINCARE Home+, whereas the CR group performs brochure-based home exercises. The primary outcome is a change in the Simple Shoulder Test (SST) score between baseline and 12 weeks postoperatively. The secondary outcomes are the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score; Shoulder Pain And Disability Index (SPADI) score; EuroQoL 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ5D5L) questionnaire score; pain; range of motion (ROM); muscle strength; and handgrip strength. The outcomes are measured at baseline, and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively. The change in SST score between baseline and 12 weeks postoperatively is significantly greater in the DR group than in the CR group (p = 0.025). The SPADI, DASH, and EQ5D5L scores demonstrate group×time interactions (p = 0.001, = 0.04, and = 0.016, respectively). However, no significant differences over time are observed between the groups in terms of pain, ROM, muscle strength, and handgrip strength. The outcomes show significant improvement in both groups (all p < 0.001). No adverse events are reported during the interventions. AR-based rehabilitation shows better improvement in terms of shoulder function after RCR compared to conventional rehabilitation. Therefore, as an alternative to the conventional rehabilitation, the digital healthcare system is effective for postoperative rehabilitation. © 2023, The Author(s).","Augmented reality; Health care; Muscle; Repair; 5-level; Adverse events; Healthcare systems; Muscle strength; Postoperative rehabilitations; Randomized controlled trial; Range-of-motion; Rotator cuff repairs; Shoulder pain; Simple++; adult; Article; body height; body mass; controlled study; demographics; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (score); European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level questionnaire; female; grip strength; health care system; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; muscle strength; outcome assessment; patient satisfaction; postoperative period; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; range of motion; rotator cuff repair; Shoulder Pain and Disability Index; single blind procedure; telerehabilitation; Patient rehabilitation","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160014005"

Results from case studies have validated such capabilities. The explainable knowledge reveals pattern-source relations on entities, and underlying factors for causal inference, and clinical study and practice; thus, addressing the major concern of interpretability, trust, and reliability when applying ML to healthcare, which is a step towards closing the AI chasm. © 2023, The Author(s).","C (programming language); Multilayer neural networks; Association patterns; Data paths; Decision weights; Interpretability; Knowledge system; Learning paradigms; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Pattern discovery; Underlying cause; article; machine learning; reliability; trust; Decision trees","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160005809"

Computer-aided analysis has the potential to better standardize and automate evaluation. We used 35.9 hours of auscultation audio from 572 pediatric outpatients to develop DeepBreath : a deep learning model identifying the audible signatures of acute respiratory illness in children. It comprises a convolutional neural network followed by a logistic regression classifier, aggregating estimates on recordings from eight thoracic sites into a single prediction at the patient-level. Patients were either healthy controls (29%) or had one of three acute respiratory illnesses (71%) including pneumonia, wheezing disorders (bronchitis/asthma), and bronchiolitis). To ensure objective estimates on model generalisability, DeepBreath is trained on patients from two countries (Switzerland, Brazil), and results are reported on an internal 5-fold cross-validation as well as externally validated (extval) on three other countries (Senegal, Cameroon, Morocco). DeepBreath differentiated healthy and pathological breathing with an Area Under the Receiver-Operator Characteristic (AUROC) of 0.93 (standard deviation [SD] ± 0.01 on internal validation). Similarly promising results were obtained for pneumonia (AUROC 0.75 ± 0.10), wheezing disorders (AUROC 0.91 ± 0.03), and bronchiolitis (AUROC 0.94 ± 0.02). Extval AUROCs were 0.89, 0.74, 0.74 and 0.87 respectively. All either matched or were significant improvements on a clinical baseline model using age and respiratory rate. Temporal attention showed clear alignment between model prediction and independently annotated respiratory cycles, providing evidence that DeepBreath extracts physiologically meaningful representations. DeepBreath provides a framework for interpretable deep learning to identify the objective audio signatures of respiratory pathology. © 2023, The Author(s).","Biological organs; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diseases; Learning systems; Pathology; Pediatrics; Physiological models; Acute respiratory illness; Automated detection; Bronchiolitis; Computer-aided analysis; Convolutional neural network; Healthy controls; Learning models; Logistic regression classifier; Receiver operator characteristics; Respiratory pathology; Computer aided analysis","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161034857"

In 2019, a large Dutch health insurance company offered 2.2 million adults free access to an mHealth app for skin cancer detection. To study the impact on dermatological healthcare consumption, we conducted a retrospective population-based pragmatic study. We matched 18,960 mHealth-users who completed at least one successful assessment with the app to 56,880 controls who did not use the app and calculated odds ratios (OR) to compare dermatological claims between both groups in the first year after granting free access. A short-term cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to determine the cost per additional detected (pre)malignancy. Here we report that mHealth-users had more claims for (pre)malignant skin lesions than controls (6.0% vs 4.6%, OR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2–1.4)) and also a more than threefold higher risk of claims for benign skin tumors and nevi (5.9% vs 1.7%, OR 3.7 (95% CI 3.4–4.1)). The costs of detecting one additional (pre)malignant skin lesion with the app compared to the current standard of care were €2567. Based on these results, AI in mHealth appears to have a positive impact on detecting more cutaneous (pre)malignancies, but this should be balanced against the for now stronger increase in care consumption for benign skin tumors and nevi. © 2023, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Cost benefit analysis; Dermatology; Diseases; Health insurance; mHealth; Oncology; Tumors; Cancer detection; First year; Free access; Healthcare systems; Insurance companies; Malignant skin; Odd ratios; Skin cancers; Skin lesion; Skin Tumour; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; benign skin tumor; cancer diagnosis; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; comparative study; controlled study; convolutional neural network; cost effectiveness analysis; cross-sectional study; dermatology; diagnostic accuracy; female; health care; health care cost; health care quality; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nevus; population; precancer; retrospective study; skin cancer; skin defect; skin tumor; Cost effectiveness","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160009691"

Using a mixed methods approach, 108 pregnant women were surveyed and 15 currently or recently pregnant women were interviewed online. We found that pregnant women used digital health tools to mainly access pregnancy related information and less so to self-monitor.

About half of the survey participants (49%) felt comfortable using a body measurement tool to monitor their body parts and 80% of interview participants were interested in using the body measurement to track leg/ankle swelling. Participants also shared additional pregnancy app features that they thought would be beneficial such as a “Digital Wallet” and a desire for a holistic pregnancy app that allowed for more continuous and personalised care.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied towards ECG analysis require large sample sizes, and transfer learning approaches for biomedical problems may result in suboptimal performance when pre-training is done on natural images. We leveraged masked image modeling to create a vision-based transformer model, HeartBEiT, for electrocardiogram waveform analysis. We pre-trained this model on 8.5 million ECGs and then compared performance vs. standard CNN architectures for diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, low left ventricular ejection fraction and ST elevation myocardial infarction using differing training sample sizes and independent validation datasets. We find that HeartBEiT has significantly higher performance at lower sample sizes compared to other models. We also find that HeartBEiT improves explainability of diagnosis by highlighting biologically relevant regions of the EKG vs. standard CNNs. Domain specific pre-trained transformer models may exceed the classification performance of models trained on natural images especially in very low data regimes. The combination of the architecture and such pre-training allows for more accurate, granular explainability of model predictions. © 2023, The Author(s).","Convolutional neural networks; Image analysis; Network architecture; Convolutional neural network; Diagnostic modality; Diagnostic performance; Electrocardiogram analysis; Natural images; Performance; Pre-training; Sample sizes; Transfer learning; Transformer modeling; Electrocardiograms","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161316544"

This accepted information bias can be managed in various ways: dropping patients with missing data, imputing with the mean, or using automatic techniques (e.g., machine learning) to handle or impute the data. Here, we systematically reviewed the methods used to handle missing data in EM research. A systematic review was performed after searching PubMed with the query “(emergency medicine OR emergency service) AND (artificial intelligence OR machine learning)”. Seventy-two studies were included in the review.

Eight publications (11%) predicted two outcomes. Only 15 (21%) publications described their missing data. DNPC constitute the “missing data” in EM machine learning studies. Although DNPC have been described more rigorously since 2020, the descriptions in the literature are not exhaustive, systematic or homogeneous. Imputation appears to be the best strategy but requires more time and computational resources. To increase the quality and the comparability of studies, we recommend inclusion of the TRIPOD checklist in each new publication, summarizing the machine learning process in an explicit methodological diagram, and always publishing the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve—even when it is not the primary outcome. © 2023, The Author(s).","Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Machine learning; Publishing; Artificial intelligence learning; Automatic technique; Decision supports; Emergency medicine; Information bias; Machine-learning; Missing data; Predictive models; Support tool; Systematic Review; artificial intelligence; checklist; emergency health service; emergency medicine; human; machine learning; Medline; mortality; outcome assessment; predictive model; probability; publishing; receiver operating characteristic; review; systematic review; Emergency services","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148851880"

They are easy to wear, provide little burden in comparison to other smart wearables, are suitable for nocturnal settings, and can be sized to provide ideal contact between the sensors and the skin at all times. Continuous measuring of blood pressure (BP) provides essential diagnostic and prognostic value for cardiovascular health management. However, conventional ambulatory BP measurement devices operate using an inflating cuff that is bulky, intrusive, and impractical for frequent or continuous measurements. We introduce ring-shaped bioimpedance sensors leveraging the deep tissue sensing ability of bioimpedance while introducing no sensitivity to skin tones, unlike optical modalities. We integrate unique human finger finite element model with exhaustive experimental data from participants and derive optimum design parameters for electrode placement and sizes that yields highest sensitivity to arterial volumetric changes, with no discrimination against varying skin tones. BP is constructed using machine learning algorithms. The ring sensors are used to estimate arterial BP showing peak correlations of 0.81, and low error (systolic BP: 0.11 ± 5.27 mmHg, diastolic BP: 0.11 ± 3.87 mmHg) for >2000 data points and wide BP ranges (systolic: 89–213 mmHg and diastolic: 42–122 mmHg), highlighting the significant potential use of bioimpedance ring for accurate and continuous estimation of BP. © 2023, The Author(s).","Blood; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mercury compounds; Wearable sensors; Bio-impedance; Bioimpedance device; Blood-pressure monitoring; Continuous measuring; Cuffless; Diagnostics and prognostics; Health management; Physiological measurement; Skin tone; Smart wearables; adult; algorithm; alternating current; arterial blood; Article; blood flow; blood pressure; blood pressure monitoring; cold pressor test; controlled study; correlation analysis; current density; diastolic blood pressure; electric current; electric potential; feature extraction; female; finite element analysis; heart cycle; human; machine learning; male; pulse wave; signal noise ratio; systolic blood pressure; waveform; Blood pressure","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153105420"

Often trained with data from a single glaucoma clinic, they report impressive performance on internal test sets, but tend to struggle in generalizing to external sets. This performance drop can be attributed to data shifts in glaucoma prevalence, fundus camera, and the definition of glaucoma ground truth. In this study, we confirm that a previously described regression network for glaucoma referral (G-RISK) obtains excellent results in a variety of challenging settings. Thirteen different data sources of labeled fundus images were utilized. The data sources include two large population cohorts (Australian Blue Mountains Eye Study, BMES and German Gutenberg Health Study, GHS) and 11 publicly available datasets (AIROGS, ORIGA, REFUGE1, LAG, ODIR, REFUGE2, GAMMA, RIM-ONEr3, RIM-ONE DL, ACRIMA, PAPILA). To minimize data shifts in input data, a standardized image processing strategy was developed to obtain 30° disc-centered images from the original data. A total of 149,455 images were included for model testing. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for BMES and GHS population cohorts were at 0.976 [95% CI: 0.967–0.986] and 0.984 [95% CI: 0.980–0.991] on participant level, respectively. At a fixed specificity of 95%, sensitivities were at 87.3% and 90.3%, respectively, surpassing the minimum criteria of 85% sensitivity recommended by Prevent Blindness America. AUC values on the eleven publicly available data sets ranged from 0.854 to 0.988. These results confirm the excellent generalizability of a glaucoma risk regression model trained with homogeneous data from a single tertiary referral center. Further validation using prospective cohort studies is warranted. © 2023, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Image processing; Large dataset; Ophthalmology; Classification models; Data-source; Datum shifts; Fundus camera; Fundus image; Ground truth; Large population; Performance; Regression modelling; Test sets; Population statistics","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161902504"

We aim to estimate the proportion of overdiagnosis in population-based service screening programs for CRC with the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). The natural process of overdiagnosis-embedded disease was first built up to learn transition parameters that quantify the pathway of non-progressive and progressive screen-detected cases calibrated with sensitivity, while also taking competing mortality into account. The Markov algorithms were then developed for estimating these transition parameters based on Taiwan FIT service CRC screening data on 5,417,699 residents aged 50–69 years from 2004 to 2014. Following the digital twin design with the parallel universe structure for emulating the randomized controlled trial, the screened twin, mirroring the control group without screening, was virtually recreated by the application of the above-mentioned trained parameters to predict CRC cases containing overdiagnosis. The ratio of the predicted CRCs derived from the screened twin to the observed CRCs of the control group minus 1 was imputed to measure the extent of overdiagnosis. The extent of overdiagnosis for invasive CRCs resulting from FIT screening is 4.16% (95% CI: 2.61–5.78%). The corresponding figure is increased to 9.90% (95% CI: 8.41–11.42%) for including high grade dysplasia (HGD) and further inflated to 15.83% (95% CI: 15.23–16.46%) when the removal adenoma is considered. The modest proportion of overdiagnosis modelled by the digital twin method, dispensing with the randomized controlled trial design, suggests the harm done to population-based FIT service screening is negligible. © 2023, The Author(s).","Diagnosis; Cancer screening; Control groups; Learn+; Natural process; Overdiagnosis; Randomized controlled trial; Screening data; Screening programs; Transition parameter; Twin design; adult; aged; Article; cancer screening; colorectal cancer; comparative study; controlled study; death registry; digital twin; female; follow up; growth rate; human; incidence; informed consent; male; Markov chain; mass screening; mortality; occult blood test; overdiagnosis; quantitative analysis; randomized controlled trial; screening test; Taiwan; tumor invasion; Diseases","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148248840"

The current review aimed at examining the performance of wearable AI in detecting and predicting depression. The search sources in this systematic review were 8 electronic databases. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were carried out by two reviewers independently. The extracted results were synthesized narratively and statistically. Of the 1314 citations retrieved from the databases, 54 studies were included in this review. The pooled mean of the highest accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.89, 0.87, 0.93, and 4.55, respectively. The pooled mean of lowest accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and RMSE was 0.70, 0.61, 0.73, and 3.76, respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed that there is a statistically significant difference in the highest accuracy, lowest accuracy, highest sensitivity, highest specificity, and lowest specificity between algorithms, and there is a statistically significant difference in the lowest sensitivity and lowest specificity between wearable devices. Wearable AI is a promising tool for depression detection and prediction although it is in its infancy and not ready for use in clinical practice. Until further research improve its performance, wearable AI should be used in conjunction with other methods for diagnosing and predicting depression. Further studies are needed to examine the performance of wearable AI based on a combination of wearable device data and neuroimaging data and to distinguish patients with depression from those with other diseases. © 2023, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Neuroimaging; Risk assessment; Wearable technology; 'current; Electronic database; High-accuracy; Meta-analysis; Performance; Root mean square errors; Statistically significant difference; Systematic Review; Traditional approaches; Wearable devices; Mean square error","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158111550"

Early diagnosis and treatment of SCC are essential to improve outcomes. Here we report a deep learning model-derived SCC-Score to detect and predict SCC from time-series data recorded continuously by a medical wearable. In this single-arm, single-center, observational cohort study, vital signs and physical activity were recorded with a wearable for 31,234 h in 79 patients (54 Inpatient Cohort (IC)/25 Outpatient Cohort (OC)). Hours with normal physical functioning without evidence of SCC (regular hours) were presented to a deep neural network that was trained by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to extract features from the time series that are typical in regular periods. The model was used to calculate a SCC-Score that measures the dissimilarity to regular features. Detection and prediction performance of the SCC-Score was compared to clinical documentation of SCC (AUROC ± SD). In total 124 clinically documented SCC occurred in the IC, 16 in the OC. Detection of SCC was achieved in the IC with a sensitivity of 79.7% and specificity of 87.9%, with AUROC of 0.91 ± 0.01 (OC sensitivity 77.4%, specificity 81.8%, AUROC 0.87 ± 0.02). Prediction of infectious SCC was possible up to 2 days before clinical diagnosis (AUROC 0.90 at −24 h and 0.88 at −48 h). We provide proof of principle for the detection and prediction of SCC in patients treated for hematological malignancies using wearable data and a deep learning model. As a consequence, remote patient monitoring may enable pre-emptive complication management. © 2023, The Author(s).","Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Integrated circuits; Learning systems; Patient monitoring; Patient treatment; Time series; Wearable technology; Clinical complications; Cohort studies; Early diagnosis; Hematological malignancies; Learning models; Learning objectives; Physical activity; Physical functioning; Time-series data; Vital sign; Forecasting","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160944698"

In total, 2504 articles were identified after duplicate removal, and 22 RCTs were included in the final meta-analysis. At the post-treatment assessment, the dCBT-I group had a small to moderate effect in alleviating depressive (standardized mean difference (SMD) = −0.42; 95% CI: −0.56, −0.28; p < 0.001; k = 21) and anxiety symptoms (SMD = −0.29; 95% CI: −0.40, −0.19; p < 0.001; k = 18), but had a large effect on sleep outcome measures (SMD = −0.76; 95% CI: −0.95, −0.57; p < 0.001; k = 22). When considering treatment adherence, the treatment effects of those in the high adherent groups identified a more robust outcome, showing greater effect sizes than those in the low adherent groups for depression, anxiety, and sleep outcomes. Furthermore, additional subgroup analysis on studies that have used the fully automated dCBT-I treatment without the support of human therapists reported significant treatment effects for depression, anxiety, and sleep outcomes. The results demonstrated that digital intervention for insomnia yielded significant effects on alleviating depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as insomnia symptoms.

Because the ability to modulate prosody develops around the age of speech acquisition, it might be affected by ASD symptoms and developmental delays that emerge at the same period. Here, we investigated the existence of a prosodic signature of developmental level and ASD symptom severity in a sample of 74 autistic preschoolers. We first developed an original diarization pipeline to extract preschoolers’ vocalizations from recordings of naturalistic social interactions. Using this novel approach, we then found a robust voice quality signature of ASD developmental difficulties in preschoolers. Furthermore, some prosodic measures were associated with one year later outcome in participants who had not acquired speech yet. Altogether, our results highlight the potential benefits of automatized diarization algorithms and prosodic metrics for digital phenotyping in psychiatry, helping clinicians establish early diagnosis and prognosis. © 2023, The Author(s).","Speech communication; Atypicals; Autism spectrum disorders; Core features; Developmental delay; Diarization; Prosodic signatures; Prosodics; Social interactions; Speech acquisition; Speech production; Diagnosis","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160703099"

This retrospective study is, to the best of our knowledge, an original attempt to develop and assess the generalization performance of a DL model for AF events detection from long term beat-to-beat intervals across geography, ages and sexes. The new recurrent DL model, denoted ArNet2, is developed on a large retrospective dataset of 2,147 patients totaling 51,386 h obtained from continuous electrocardiogram (ECG). The model’s generalization is evaluated on manually annotated test sets from four centers (USA, Israel, Japan and China) totaling 402 patients. The model is further validated on a retrospective dataset of 1,825 consecutives Holter recordings from Israel. The model outperforms benchmark state-of-the-art models and generalized well across geography, ages and sexes. For the task of event detection ArNet2 performance was higher for female than male, higher for young adults (less than 61 years old) than other age groups and across geography. Finally, ArNet2 shows better performance for the test sets from the USA and China. The main finding explaining these variations is an impairment in performance in groups with a higher prevalence of atrial flutter (AFL). Our findings on the relative performance of ArNet2 across groups may have clinical implications on the choice of the preferred AF examination method to use relative to the group of interest. © 2023, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Electrocardiograms; Large dataset; Atrial fibrillation; Events detection; Generalisation; Generalization performance; Holter recordings; Japan and China; Learning models; Performance; State of the art; Test sets; adult; age distribution; aged; analytical error; Article; atrial fibrillation; China; controlled study; deep learning; electrocardiography; female; groups by age; histogram; Holter monitoring; human; Israel; Japan; learning algorithm; major clinical study; male; medical geography; Medline; population research; retrospective study; sex difference; United States; young adult; Learning algorithms","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150862392"

Laboratory-based biomechanical assessment can evaluate ACL injury risk and rehabilitation progress after ACLR; however, lab-based measurements are expensive and inaccessible to most people. Portable sensors such as wearables and cameras can be deployed during sporting activities, in clinics, and in patient homes. Although many portable sensing approaches have demonstrated promising results during various assessments related to ACL injury, they have not yet been widely adopted as tools for out-of-lab assessment. The purpose of this review is to summarize research on out-of-lab portable sensing applied to ACL and ACLR and offer our perspectives on new opportunities for future research and development. We identified 49 original research articles on out-of-lab ACL-related assessment; the most common sensing modalities were inertial measurement units, depth cameras, and RGB cameras. The studies combined portable sensors with direct feature extraction, physics-based modeling, or machine learning to estimate a range of biomechanical parameters (e.g., knee kinematics and kinetics) during jump-landing tasks, cutting, squats, and gait. Many of the reviewed studies depict proof-of-concept methods for potential future clinical applications including ACL injury risk screening, injury prevention training, and rehabilitation assessment. By synthesizing these results, we describe important opportunities that exist for clinical validation of existing approaches, using sophisticated modeling techniques, standardization of data collection, and creation of large benchmark datasets. If successful, these advances will enable widespread use of portable-sensing approaches to identify ACL injury risk factors, mitigate high-risk movements prior to injury, and optimize rehabilitation paradigms. © 2023, The Author(s).","Cameras; Laboratories; Large dataset; Physiological models; Risk assessment; Wearable sensors; ACL reconstruction; Anterior cruciate ligament; Anterior cruciate ligament injury; Anterior-Cruciate-Ligament reconstruction; Biomechanical assessment; Injury prevention; Injury risk; Portable sensors; Research and development; Scoping review; accident prevention; anterior cruciate ligament; anterior cruciate ligament injury; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; biomechanics; feature extraction; gait; human; kinematics; kinetics; machine learning; physics; proof of concept; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; standardization; validation process; Biomechanics","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150928369"

Despite the significant impact on the healthcare system, it is still challenging to leverage machine learning or statistical models to predict PsA and its progression, or analyze drug efficacy. With 3961 patients’ clinical records, we developed a machine learning model for PsA diagnosis and analysis of PsA progression risk, respectively. Furthermore, general additive models (GAMs) and the Kaplan–Meier (KM) method were applied to analyze the efficacy of various drugs on psoriasis treatment and inhibiting PsA progression. The independent experiment on the PsA prediction model demonstrates outstanding prediction performance with an AUC score of 0.87 and an AUPR score of 0.89, and the Jackknife validation test on the PsA progression prediction model also suggests the superior performance with an AUC score of 0.80 and an AUPR score of 0.83, respectively. We also identified that interleukin-17 inhibitors were the more effective drug for severe psoriasis compared to other drugs, and methotrexate had a lower effect in inhibiting PsA progression.

Despite chatbots’ significance amid the COVID-19 pandemic, few studies have performed a rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of chatbots in improving vaccine confidence and acceptance. In Thailand, Hong Kong, and Singapore, from February 11th to June 30th, 2022, we conducted multisite randomised controlled trials (RCT) on 2,045 adult guardians of children and seniors who were unvaccinated or had delayed vaccinations. After a week of using COVID-19 vaccine chatbots, the differences in vaccine confidence and acceptance were compared between the intervention and control groups. Compared to non-users, fewer chatbot users reported decreased confidence in vaccine effectiveness in the Thailand child group [Intervention: 4.3 % vs. Control: 17%, P = 0.023]. However, more chatbot users reported decreased vaccine acceptance [26% vs. 12%, P = 0.028] in Hong Kong child group and decreased vaccine confidence in safety [29% vs. 10%, P = 0.041] in Singapore child group. There was no statistically significant change in vaccine confidence or acceptance in the Hong Kong senior group. Employing the RE-AIM framework, process evaluation indicated strong acceptance and implementation support for vaccine chatbots from stakeholders, with high levels of sustainability and scalability.

Previous artificial intelligence (AI) systems were primarily unexplainable, affecting their clinical credibility and acceptability. We aimed to develop an explainable AI named ENDOANGEL-ED (explainable diagnosis) to solve this problem. A total of 4482 images and 296 videos with focal lesions from 3279 patients from eight hospitals were used for training, validating, and testing ENDOANGEL-ED. A traditional sole deep learning (DL) model was trained using the same dataset. The performance of ENDOANGEL-ED and sole DL was evaluated on six levels: internal and external images, internal and external videos, consecutive videos, and man–machine comparison with 77 endoscopists in videos. Furthermore, a multi-reader, multi-case study was conducted to evaluate the ENDOANGEL-ED’s effectiveness. A scale was used to compare the overall acceptance of endoscopists to traditional and explainable AI systems. The ENDOANGEL-ED showed high performance in the image and video tests. In man–machine comparison, the accuracy of ENDOANGEL-ED was significantly higher than that of all endoscopists in internal (81.10% vs. 70.61%, p < 0.001) and external videos (88.24% vs. 78.49%, p < 0.001). With ENDOANGEL-ED’s assistance, the accuracy of endoscopists significantly improved (70.61% vs. 79.63%, p < 0.001). Compared with the traditional AI, the explainable AI increased the endoscopists’ trust and acceptance (4.42 vs. 3.74, p < 0.001; 4.52 vs. 4.00, p < 0.001). In conclusion, we developed a real-time explainable AI that showed high performance, higher clinical credibility, and acceptance than traditional DL models and greatly improved the diagnostic ability of endoscopists. © 2023, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Domain Knowledge; Tumors; Artificial intelligence systems; Case-studies; Diagnostic ability; Domain knowledge; Gastric neoplasms; Learning models; Man machines; Performance; Real- time; White light; adenomatous polyp; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; atrophic gastritis; cancer patient; case study; chronic inflammation; clinical decision making; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; crossover procedure; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; differential diagnosis; early cancer; early cancer diagnosis; endoscopist; feature extraction; female; gaussian naive bayes; gradient boosting decision tree; health personnel attitude; human; human versus nonhuman data; image analysis; intermethod comparison; intestinal metaplasia of the stomach; intraepithelial neoplasia; k nearest neighbor; knowledge; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; male; man machine interaction; middle aged; predictive value; prospective study; random forest; randomized controlled trial; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; stomach cancer; stomach carcinoma; stomach lymphoma; stomach polyp; support vector machine; trust; tumor differentiation; validation study; videorecording; white light endoscopy; Endoscopy","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153111547"

This study aims to examine the association of hourly criteria air pollutants with AF episodes. We employ a smart device-based photoplethysmography technology to screen AF from 2018 to 2021. Hourly concentrations of six criteria air pollutants are matched to the onset hour of AF for each participant. We adopt a time-stratified case-crossover design to capture the acute effects of air pollutants on AF episodes, using conditional logistic regression models. Subgroup analyses are conducted by age, gender, and season. A total of 11,906 episodes of AF are identified in 2976 participants from 288 Chinese cities. Generally, the strongest associations of air pollutants are present at lag 18–24 h, with positive and linear exposure-response relationships. For an interquartile range increase in inhalable particles, fine particles, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide, the odds ratio (OR) of AF is 1.19 [95% confidential interval (CI): 1.03, 1.37], 1.38 (95%CI: 1.14, 1.67), 1.60 (95%CI: 1.16, 2.20) and 1.48 (95%CI: 1.19, 1.84), respectively. The estimates are robust to the adjustment of co-pollutants, and they are larger in females, older people, and in cold seasons. There are insignificant associations for sulfur dioxide and ozone. This nationwide case-crossover study demonstrates robust evidence of significant associations between hourly exposure to air pollutants and the onset of AF episodes, which underscores the importance of ongoing efforts to further improve air quality as an effective target for AF prevention. © 2023, The Author(s).","Air quality; Diseases; Nitrogen oxides; Regression analysis; Sulfur dioxide; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; Air pollutants; Atrial fibrillation; Case-crossover designs; Chinese cities; Conditional logistic regressions; Confidential interval; Criteria air pollutants; Logistic Regression modeling; Short-term exposure; Smart devices; adult; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; atrial fibrillation; city; cold stress; controlled study; crossover procedure; female; gender; human; major clinical study; male; photoelectric plethysmography; respirable particulate matter; season; Carbon monoxide","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150676196"

The proper use of wearable technology in sleep research requires validated algorithms that can derive sleep outcomes from the sensor data. Since the publication of the first automated scoring algorithm by Webster in 1982, a variety of sleep algorithms have been developed and contributed to sleep research, including many recent ones that leverage machine learning and / or deep learning approaches. However, it remains unclear how these algorithms compare to each other on the same data set and if these modern data science approaches improve the analytical validity of sleep outcomes based on wrist-worn acceleration data. This work provides a systematic evaluation across 8 state-of-the-art sleep algorithms on a common sleep data set with polysomnography (PSG) as ground truth. Despite the inclusion of recently published complex algorithms, simple regression-based and heuristic algorithms demonstrated slightly superior performance in sleep-wake classification and sleep outcome estimation.

E-triage interventions like kiosks have been proposed as a solution to overcrowding. We conducted a literature review into the effectiveness of kiosks in improving triage efficiency. After rigorously searching five biomedical databases and screening candidate articles in Endnote, we identified nine papers pertaining to the introduction of kiosks in emergency departments. Six articles had positive findings—with E-triage interventions improving some aspect of the triage process—such as reducing pre-triage times. Conversely, only three articles reported negative findings, such as low uptake. Consequently, EDs should consider introducing kiosks to complement the current nurse-led triage process and thereby promote better patient outcomes. © 2023, The Author(s).","Diagnosis; Emergency rooms; 'current; Emergency departments; Literature reviews; Waiting time; emergency ward; human; null result; nurse; outcome assessment; patient triage; review; Efficiency","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147332304"

Annotation inconsistencies commonly occur when even highly experienced clinical experts annotate the same phenomenon (e.g., medical image, diagnostics, or prognostic status), due to inherent expert bias, judgments, and slips, among other factors. While their existence is relatively well-known, the implications of such inconsistencies are largely understudied in real-world settings, when supervised learning is applied on such ‘noisy’ labelled data. To shed light on these issues, we conducted extensive experiments and analyses on three real-world Intensive Care Unit (ICU) datasets. Specifically, individual models were built from a common dataset, annotated independently by 11 Glasgow Queen Elizabeth University Hospital ICU consultants, and model performance estimates were compared through internal validation (Fleiss’ κ = 0.383 i.e., fair agreement). Further, broad external validation (on both static and time series datasets) of these 11 classifiers was carried out on a HiRID external dataset, where the models’ classifications were found to have low pairwise agreements (average Cohen’s κ = 0.255 i.e., minimal agreement). Moreover, they tend to disagree more on making discharge decisions (Fleiss’ κ = 0.174) than predicting mortality (Fleiss’ κ = 0.267). Given these inconsistencies, further analyses were conducted to evaluate the current best practices in obtaining gold-standard models and determining consensus. The results suggest that: (a) there may not always be a “super expert” in acute clinical settings (using internal and external validation model performances as a proxy); and (b) standard consensus seeking (such as majority vote) consistently leads to suboptimal models. Further analysis, however, suggests that assessing annotation learnability and using only ‘learnable’ annotated datasets for determining consensus achieves optimal models in most cases. © 2023, The Author(s).","Classification (of information); Decision making; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Supervised learning; Class labels; Clinical decision making; Domain experts; Expert bias; Human annotations; Labeled data; Learning models; Model development; Modeling performance; Real world setting; article; classifier; clinical decision making; consensus; consultation; gold standard; human; intensive care unit; mortality; time series analysis; university hospital; Intensive care units","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148694822"

In people with preserved kidney function, the Reti-CKD score effectively stratifies future CKD risk with greater performance than conventional eGFR-based methods. © 2023, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Patient treatment; Biobanks; Chronic kidney disease; Confidence interval; Disease risks; Follow up; High-risk patients; Kidney function; Performance; Risk stratification; Up period; Learning algorithms","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162122621"

Our assessment is tested in a clinical setting against the ground truth obtained from video recordings. The new approach addresses unmet challenges in existing studies, such as the lack of generalizability to real-world applications, the failure to capture finger scratches, and the limitations in the evaluation due to imbalanced data in the current literature. Furthermore, the performance evaluation shows agreement between derived digital endpoints and the video annotation ground truth, as well as patient-reported outcomes, which demonstrated the validity of the new assessment of nocturnal scratch. © 2023, The Author(s).","Patient monitoring; Patient treatment; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Topology; Actigraphy; Atopic dermatitis; Clinical settings; Disease state; Ground truth; Major factors; New approaches; Quality of life; Topological features; Treatment effects; actimetry; adult; arousal; Article; atopic dermatitis; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; male; night; scratching; signal processing; videorecording; Video recording","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85156153593"

It uses multiplexed immunofluorescence for the simultaneous visualization and quantification of CD68 + macrophages, CD8 + T cells, FOXP3 + regulatory T cells, PD-L1/PD-1 protein expression, and tumor cells. We used 489 tumor cores from 250 patients to train a multilevel deep-learning model to predict tumor recurrence.

We used electronic health record (EHR) data and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict response to four antidepressants classes (SSRI, SNRI, bupropion, and mirtazapine) 4 to 12 weeks after antidepressant initiation. The final data set comprised 17,556 patients. Predictors were derived from both structured and unstructured EHR data and models accounted for features predictive of treatment selection to minimize confounding by indication. Outcome labels were derived through expert chart review and AI-automated imputation. Regularized generalized linear model (GLM), random forest, gradient boosting machine (GBM), and deep neural network (DNN) models were trained and their performance compared. Predictor importance scores were derived using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). All models demonstrated similarly good prediction performance (AUROCs ≥ 0.70, AUPRCs ≥ 0.68). The models can estimate differential treatment response probabilities both between patients and between antidepressant classes for the same patient. In addition, patient-specific factors driving response probabilities for each antidepressant class can be generated.

For early diagnosis, intervention and management of CVDs, it is highly desirable to frequently monitor blood pressure (BP), a vital sign closely related to CVDs, during people’s daily life, including sleep time. Towards this end, wearable and cuffless BP extraction methods have been extensively researched in recent years as part of the mobile healthcare initiative. This review focuses on the enabling technologies for wearable and cuffless BP monitoring platforms, covering both the emerging flexible sensor designs and BP extraction algorithms. Based on the signal type, the sensing devices are classified into electrical, optical, and mechanical sensors, and the state-of-the-art material choices, fabrication methods, and performances of each type of sensor are briefly reviewed. In the model part of the review, contemporary algorithmic BP estimation methods for beat-to-beat BP measurements and continuous BP waveform extraction are introduced. Mainstream approaches, such as pulse transit time-based analytical models and machine learning methods, are compared in terms of their input modalities, features, implementation algorithms, and performances. The review sheds light on the interdisciplinary research opportunities to combine the latest innovations in the sensor and signal processing research fields to achieve a new generation of cuffless BP measurement devices with improved wearability, reliability, and accuracy. © 2023, The Author(s).","Blood; Diagnosis; Extraction; Machine learning; Signal processing; Wearable sensors; Blood-pressure monitoring; Cardiovascular disease; Causes of death; Cuffless; Daily lives; Early diagnosis; Modeling technology; Sensing technology; Sleep time; Vital sign; blood pressure monitoring; calibration; electrocardiogram; human; interdisciplinary research; machine learning; mechanics; noise reduction; optical sensor; Review; Blood pressure","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160021109"

Scaling CDS to the panoply of clinical use cases while mitigating risks to patients will require many ML models be intuitively interpretable for clinicians. To this end, we adapted a symbolic regression method, coined the feature engineering automation tool (FEAT), to train concise and accurate models from high-dimensional electronic health record (EHR) data. We first present an in-depth application of FEAT to classify hypertension, hypertension with unexplained hypokalemia, and apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (aTRH) using EHR data for 1200 subjects receiving longitudinal care in a large healthcare system. FEAT models trained to predict phenotypes adjudicated by chart review had equivalent or higher discriminative performance (p < 0.001) and were at least three times smaller (p < 1 × 10−6) than other potentially interpretable models. For aTRH, FEAT generated a six-feature, highly discriminative (positive predictive value = 0.70, sensitivity = 0.62), and clinically intuitive model. To assess the generalizability of the approach, we tested FEAT on 25 benchmark clinical phenotyping tasks using the MIMIC-III critical care database. Under comparable dimensionality constraints, FEAT’s models exhibited higher area under the receiver-operating curve scores than penalized linear models across tasks (p < 6 × 10−6). In summary, FEAT can train EHR prediction models that are both intuitively interpretable and accurate, which should facilitate safe and effective scaling of ML-triggered CDS to the panoply of potential clinical use cases and healthcare practices. © 2023, The Author(s).","Decision support systems; Health care; Regression analysis; Automation tools; Clinical decision support; Electronic health; Engineering automation; Feature engineerings; Health records; Machine learning models; Prediction modelling; Regression method; Symbolic regression; Forecasting","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161374860"

This results in a slightly smaller cohort (n = 931) for validation, compared to the 20% validation set used in the original paper, and still demonstrates similar performance to the MMAI algorithms using only pretreatment tissue for each clinical endpoint.

As the date of the last menstrual period is often unknown or uncertain, ultrasound measurement of fetal size is currently the best method for estimating gestational age. The calculation assumes an average fetal size at each gestational age. The method is accurate in the first trimester, but less so in the second and third trimesters as growth deviates from the average and variation in fetal size increases. Consequently, fetal ultrasound late in pregnancy has a wide margin of error of at least ±2 weeks’ gestation. Here, we utilise state-of-the-art machine learning methods to estimate gestational age using only image analysis of standard ultrasound planes, without any measurement information. The machine learning model is based on ultrasound images from two independent datasets: one for training and internal validation, and another for external validation. During validation, the model was blinded to the ground truth of gestational age (based on a reliable last menstrual period date and confirmatory first-trimester fetal crown rump length). We show that this approach compensates for increases in size variation and is even accurate in cases of intrauterine growth restriction. Our best machine-learning based model estimates gestational age with a mean absolute error of 3.0 (95% CI, 2.9–3.2) and 4.3 (95% CI, 4.1–4.5) days in the second and third trimesters, respectively, which outperforms current ultrasound-based clinical biometry at these gestational ages. Our method for dating the pregnancy in the second and third trimesters is, therefore, more accurate than published methods. © 2023, The Author(s).","Decision making; Machine learning; Ultrasonics; Accurate estimation; Age-based; Clinical decision making; Fetal ultrasound; First trimesters; Gestational age; Machine-learning; Measurements of; Ultrasound images; Ultrasound measurement; accuracy; achondroplasia; adult; Article; biometry; body mass; body weight; controlled study; crown rump length; demographics; female; fetus; first trimester pregnancy; gestational age; human; image analysis; intrauterine growth retardation; machine learning; menstrual cycle; newborn disease; second trimester pregnancy; third trimester pregnancy; Obstetrics","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149974498"

Thus, scalable, quantitative methods for measuring motor behavior in young autistic children are needed. This work presents an engaging and scalable assessment of visual-motor abilities based on a bubble-popping game administered on a tablet. Participants are 233 children ranging from 1.5 to 10 years of age (147 neurotypical children and 86 children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder [autistic], of which 32 are also diagnosed with co-occurring attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [autistic+ADHD]). Computer vision analyses are used to extract several game-based touch features, which are compared across autistic, autistic+ADHD, and neurotypical participants. Results show that younger (1.5-3 years) autistic children pop the bubbles at a lower rate, and their ability to touch the bubble’s center is less accurate compared to neurotypical children. When they pop a bubble, their finger lingers for a longer period, and they show more variability in their performance. In older children (3-10-years), consistent with previous research, the presence of co-occurring ADHD is associated with greater motor impairment, reflected in lower accuracy and more variable performance. Several motor features are correlated with standardized assessments of fine motor and cognitive abilities, as evaluated by an independent clinical assessment. These results highlight the potential of touch-based games as an efficient and scalable approach for assessing children’s visual-motor skills, which can be part of a broader screening tool for identifying early signs associated with autism. © 2023, The Author(s).","Computer games; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Autism spectrum disorders; Autistic children; Common features; Game-Based; Motor abilities; Motor behaviours; Motor impairments; Motor skills; Quantitative method; age; area under the curve; Article; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism; Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule; child; clinical assessment; cognition; computer vision; controlled study; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; motor dysfunction; motor performance; Mullen scales of early learning; receiver operating characteristic; video game; Diseases","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147371207"

Currently, estimating the quantity of labeled data needed to train a classifier to a desired performance, is largely based on prior experience with similar models and problems or on untested heuristics. In many supervised machine learning applications, data labeling can be expensive and time-consuming and would benefit from a more rigorous means of estimating labeling requirements. Here, we study the problem of estimating the minimum sample size of labeled training data necessary for training computer vision models as an exemplar for other deep learning problems. We consider the problem of identifying the minimal number of labeled data points to achieve a generalizable representation of the data, a minimum converging sample (MCS). We use autoencoder loss to estimate the MCS for fully connected neural network classifiers. At sample sizes smaller than the MCS estimate, fully connected networks fail to distinguish classes, and at sample sizes above the MCS estimate, generalizability strongly correlates with the loss function of the autoencoder. We provide an easily accessible, code-free, and dataset-agnostic tool to estimate sample sizes for fully connected networks. Taken together, our findings suggest that MCS and convergence estimation are promising methods to guide sample size estimates for data collection and labeling prior to training deep learning models in computer vision. © 2022, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Sampling; Supervised learning; Auto encoders; Data labelling; Fully connected networks; Fully connected neural network; Labeled data; Neural networks classifiers; Performance; Prior experience; Sample size estimation; Sample sizes; Agnostic; area under the curve; Article; autoencoder; binocular convergence; classifier; computer vision; deep learning; deep neural network; experimental design; growth curve; human; information processing; learning curve; learning disorder; loss of function mutation; pneumonia; sample size; supervised machine learning; thorax radiography; Computer vision","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143818608"

Knowledge-based methods that represent and reason the standard, explainable process of a task may need to be incorporated into deep learning-based methods for clinical coding. Automated clinical coding is a promising task for AI, despite the technical and organisational challenges. Coders are needed to be involved in the development process.

Millions of adults suffer from dysphagia (impaired or difficulty swallowing), including patients with neurological disorders, head and neck cancer, gastrointestinal diseases, and respiratory disorders. Therapeutic treatments for dysphagia include interventions by speech-language pathologists designed to improve the physiology of the swallowing mechanism by training patients to initiate swallows with sufficient frequency and during the expiratory phase of the breathing cycle. These therapeutic treatments require bulky, expensive equipment to synchronously record swallows and respirations, confined to use in clinical settings. This paper introduces a wireless, wearable technology that enables continuous, mechanoacoustic tracking of respiratory activities and swallows through movements and vibratory processes monitored at the skin surface. Validation studies in healthy adults (n = 67) and patients with dysphagia (n = 4) establish measurement equivalency to existing clinical standard equipment. Additional studies using a differential mode of operation reveal similar performance even during routine daily activities and vigorous exercise.

From a human-centered design perspective, transparency is not a property of the ML model but an affordance, i.e., a relationship between algorithm and users. Thus, prototyping and user evaluations are critical to attaining solutions that afford transparency. Following human-centered design principles in highly specialized and high stakes domains, such as medical image analysis, is challenging due to the limited access to end users and the knowledge imbalance between those users and ML designers. To investigate the state of transparent ML in medical image analysis, we conducted a systematic review of the literature from 2012 to 2021 in PubMed, EMBASE, and Compendex databases. We identified 2508 records and 68 articles met the inclusion criteria. Current techniques in transparent ML are dominated by computational feasibility and barely consider end users, e.g. clinical stakeholders. Despite the different roles and knowledge of ML developers and end users, no study reported formative user research to inform the design and development of transparent ML models. Only a few studies validated transparency claims through empirical user evaluations. These shortcomings put contemporary research on transparent ML at risk of being incomprehensible to users, and thus, clinically irrelevant. To alleviate these shortcomings in forthcoming research, we introduce the INTRPRT guideline, a design directive for transparent ML systems in medical image analysis. The INTRPRT guideline suggests human-centered design principles, recommending formative user research as the first step to understand user needs and domain requirements. Following these guidelines increases the likelihood that the algorithms afford transparency and enable stakeholders to capitalize on the benefits of transparent ML. © 2022, The Author(s).","Image analysis; Medical imaging; Design Principles; End-users; Human-centred designs; Interpretability; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Medical image analysis; Systematic Review; User evaluations; User research; algorithm; diagnostic imaging; Embase; feasibility study; human; human experiment; image analysis; machine learning; Medline; practice guideline; review; systematic review; universal design; Transparency","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140208455"

To date, the results of studies on the impact factors have been inconsistent. Consequently, research on the pooled effects of impact factors on the continuance intention of mHealth is limited. Therefore, this study aims to systematically analyze quantitative studies on the continuance intention of mHealth and explore the pooled effect of each direct and indirect impact factor. Until October 2021, eight literature databases were searched. Fifty-eight peer-reviewed studies on the impact factors and effects on continuance intention of mHealth were included. Out of the 19 direct impact factors of continuance intention, 15 are significant, with attitude (β = 0.450; 95% CI: 0.135, 0.683), satisfaction (β = 0.406; 95% CI: 0.292, 0.509), health empowerment (β = 0.359; 95% CI: 0.204, 0.497), perceived usefulness (β = 0.343; 95% CI: 0.280, 0.403), and perceived quality of health life (β = 0.315, 95% CI: 0.211, 0.412) having the largest pooled effect coefficients on continuance intention. There is high heterogeneity between the studies; thus, we conducted a subgroup analysis to explore the moderating effect of different characteristics on the impact effects. The geographic region, user type, mHealth type, user age, and publication year significantly moderate influential relationships, such as trust and continuance intention. Thus, mHealth developers should develop personalized continuous use promotion strategies based on user characteristics. © 2022, The Author(s).","mHealth; Continuance intentions; Direct and indirect impacts; Direct impact; Global market; Health industry; Impact factor; Literature database; Meta-analysis; Quantitative study; Systematic Review; empowerment; human; meta analysis; quantitative analysis; review; satisfaction; systematic review; trust; International trade","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138203840"

Framework steps include defining clinical quality improvement goals, model development and validation, bias assessment, retrospective and prospective validation, and deployment in clinical workflow. In the retrospective analysis for the use case, 8% of patient encounters were associated with a high risk (pre-defined as predicted probability ≥20%) for a near-term ED visit by the patient. Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for future ED events was 26% and 91%, respectively. Odds ratio (OR) of ED visit (high- vs. low-risk) was 3.5 (95% CI: 3.4–3.5).

Its use has historically been focused on single modal data. Attempts to improve prediction and mimic the multimodal nature of clinical expert decision-making has been met in the biomedical field of machine learning by fusing disparate data. This review was conducted to summarize the current studies in this field and identify topics ripe for future research. We conducted this review in accordance with the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews to characterize multi-modal data fusion in health. Search strings were established and used in databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEEXplore from 2011 to 2021. A final set of 128 articles were included in the analysis. The most common health areas utilizing multi-modal methods were neurology and oncology. Early fusion was the most common data merging strategy. Notably, there was an improvement in predictive performance when using data fusion. Lacking from the papers were clear clinical deployment strategies, FDA-approval, and analysis of how using multimodal approaches from diverse sub-populations may improve biases and healthcare disparities. These findings provide a summary on multimodal data fusion as applied to health diagnosis/prognosis problems. Few papers compared the outputs of a multimodal approach with a unimodal prediction. However, those that did achieved an average increase of 6.4% in predictive accuracy.

Surveillance is generally based on self-reporting, making the monitoring process subjective. We study participants in Israel who received their second or third Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination. All participants wore a Garmin Vivosmart 4 smartwatch and completed a daily questionnaire via smartphone. We compare post-vaccination smartwatch heart rate data and a Garmin-computed stress measure based on heart rate variability with data from the patient questionnaires. Using a mixed effects panel regression to remove participant-level fixed and random effects, we identify considerable changes in smartwatch measures in the 72 h post-vaccination even among participants who reported no side effects in the questionnaire. Wearable devices were more sensitive than questionnaires in determining when participants returned to baseline levels. We conclude that wearable devices can detect physiological responses following vaccination that may not be captured by patient self-reporting. More broadly, the ubiquity of smartwatches provides an opportunity to gather improved data on patient health, including active surveillance of vaccine safety. © 2022, The Author(s).","Heart; Monitoring; Physiological models; Random processes; Surveys; Vaccines; Wearable computers; bnt 162b 2; tozinameran; Fixed effects; Heart rate variability; Heart-rate; High sensitivity; Mixed effects; Monitoring process; Self-reporting; Smart phones; Vaccine safety; Wearable devices; abdominal pain; active surveillance; adult; adverse drug reaction; ageusia; anosmia; Article; backache; chill; cohort analysis; confusion; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; dizziness; drug safety; dyspnea; fatigue; female; fever; headache; heart rate; heart rate variability; human; hypertension; Israel; leg pain; major clinical study; male; middle aged; myalgia; neck pain; otalgia; pilot study; self report; sore throat; thorax pain; vaccination; vomiting; weakness; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138147433"

By tracking both large-scale utilization and clinical imaging results data, the MIDH approach is targeted at measuring surrogates for important disease-related observational quantities over time. To quantitatively investigate its clinical applicability, we performed a retrospective multi-institutional study encompassing 13 healthcare systems throughout the United States before and after the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Using repurposed software infrastructure of a commercial AI-based image analysis service, we harvested data on medical imaging service requests and radiology reports for 40,037 computed tomography pulmonary angiograms (CTPA) to evaluate for pulmonary embolism (PE). Specifically, we compared two 70-day observational periods, namely (i) a pre-pandemic control period from 11/25/2019 through 2/2/2020, and (ii) a period during the early COVID-19 pandemic from 3/8/2020 through 5/16/2020. Natural language processing (NLP) on final radiology reports served as the ground truth for identifying positive PE cases, where we found an NLP accuracy of 98% for classifying radiology reports as positive or negative for PE based on a manual review of 2,400 radiology reports. Fewer CTPA exams were performed during the early COVID-19 pandemic than during the pre-pandemic period (9806 vs. 12,106). However, the PE positivity rate was significantly higher (11.6 vs. 9.9%, p < 10−4) with an excess of 92 PE cases during the early COVID-19 outbreak, i.e., ~1.3 daily PE cases more than statistically expected. Our results suggest that MIDH can contribute value as an exploratory tool, aiming at a better understanding of pandemic-related effects on healthcare. © 2022, The Author(s).","Computerized tomography; Harvesting; Health care; Medical imaging; Natural language processing systems; Radiation; Radiology; Data harvesting; Harvesting methods; Healthcare systems; Language processing; Large-scales; Natural languages; Pulmonary embolism; Radiology reports; Scale utilization; Software infrastructure; adult; aged; Article; artificial intelligence; brain hemorrhage; cohort analysis; comparative study; computed tomography pulmonary angiography; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic test accuracy study; emergency ward; female; health care system; human; image analysis; information processing; longitudinal study; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; natural language processing; pandemic; positivity rate; prevalence; radiology; retrospective study; United States; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136994958"

Here, we combined tablet-based self-directed hearing assessments with neural network classifiers to automatically differentiate participants with tinnitus (N = 24) from a malingering cohort, who were instructed to feign an imagined tinnitus percept (N = 28). We identified clear differences between the groups, both in their overt reporting of tinnitus features, but also covert differences in their fingertip movement trajectories on the tablet surface as they performed the reporting assay.

Fitness is directly measured as maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), or indirectly assessed using heart rate responses to standard exercise tests. However, such testing is costly and burdensome because it requires specialized equipment such as treadmills and oxygen masks, limiting its utility. Modern wearables capture dynamic real-world data which could improve fitness prediction. In this work, we design algorithms and models that convert raw wearable sensor data into cardiorespiratory fitness estimates. We validate these estimates’ ability to capture fitness profiles in free-living conditions using the Fenland Study (N=11,059), along with its longitudinal cohort (N = 2675), and a third external cohort using the UK Biobank Validation Study (N = 181) who underwent maximal VO2max testing, the gold standard measurement of fitness. Our results show that the combination of wearables and other biomarkers as inputs to neural networks yields a strong correlation to ground truth in a holdout sample (r = 0.82, 95CI 0.80–0.83), outperforming other approaches and models and detects fitness change over time (e.g., after 7 years). We also show how the model’s latent space can be used for fitness-aware patient subtyping paving the way to scalable interventions and personalized trial recruitment. These results demonstrate the value of wearables for fitness estimation that today can be measured only with laboratory tests. © 2022, The Author(s).","Ability testing; Patient treatment; Exercise test; Free livings; Heart rate response; Living environment; Metabolic disease; Oxygen consumption; Oxygen masks; Real-world; Sensors data; Specialized equipment; adult; algorithm; Article; biobank; cardiorespiratory fitness; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; gold standard; human; longitudinal study; male; maximal oxygen uptake; middle aged; normal human; prediction; United Kingdom; Oxygen","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143164922"

Unfortunately, the resulting models are often difficult for clinicians to interpret, making clinical inspection and validation of these computationally derived strategies challenging in advance of deployment. In this work, we develop a general framework for identifying succinct sets of clinical contexts in which clinicians make very different treatment choices, tracing the effects of those choices, and inferring a set of recommendations for those specific contexts. By focusing on these few key decision points, our framework produces succinct, interpretable treatment strategies that can each be easily visualized and verified by clinical experts. This interrogation process allows clinicians to leverage the model’s use of historical data in tandem with their own expertise to determine which recommendations are worth investigating further e.g. at the bedside. We demonstrate the value of this approach via application to hypotension management in the ICU, an area with critical implications for patient outcomes that lacks data-driven individualized treatment strategies; that said, our framework has broad implications on how to use computational methods to assist with decision-making challenges on a wide range of clinical domains. © 2022, The Author(s).","Decision making; Intensive care units; Patient treatment; Reinforcement learning; Clinical decision making; Data driven; Decision points; Decisions makings; Deployment models; Different treatments; Historical data; Reinforcement learnings; RL framework; Article; clinical decision making; conceptual framework; health care policy; hypotension; intensive care unit; reinforcement learning (machine learning); Computational methods","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142166636"

Our ability to perceive these vibrations is limited by our range of hearing. However, in-ear infrasonic hemodynography (IH) can measure low-frequency vibrations (<20 Hz) created by vital organs as an acoustic waveform. This is captured using a technology that can be embedded into wearable devices such as in-ear headphones. IH can acquire sound signals that travel within arteries, fluids, bones, and muscles in proximity to the ear canal, allowing for measurements of an individual’s unique audiome. We describe the heart rate and heart rhythm results obtained in time-series analysis of the in-ear IH data taken simultaneously with ECG recordings in two dedicated clinical studies. We demonstrate a high correlation (r = 0.99) between IH and ECG acquired interbeat interval and heart rate measurements and show that IH can continuously monitor physiological changes in heart rate induced by various breathing exercises. We also show that IH can differentiate between atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm with performance similar to ECG. The results represent a demonstration of IH capabilities to deliver accurate heart rate and heart rhythm measurements comparable to ECG, in a wearable form factor.

Early perception of the occurrence and development risk of cryptic transmission is an important part of controlling the spread of COVID-19. Previous relevant studies have limited data sources, and no effective analysis has been carried out on the occurrence and development of cryptic transmission. Hence, we collect Internet multisource big data (including retrieval, migration, and media data) and propose comprehensive and relative application strategies to eliminate the impact of national and media data. We use statistical classification and regression to construct an early warning model for occurrence and development. Under the guidance of the improved coronavirus herd immunity optimizer (ICHIO), we construct a “sampling-feature-hyperparameter-weight” synchronous optimization strategy. In occurrence warning, we propose an undersampling synchronous evolutionary ensemble (USEE); in development warning, we propose a bootstrap-sampling synchronous evolutionary ensemble (BSEE). Regarding the internal training data (Heilongjiang Province), the ROC-AUC of USEE3 incorporating multisource data is 0.9553, the PR-AUC is 0.8327, and the R2 of BSEE2 fused by the “nonlinear + linear” method is 0.8698. Regarding the external validation data (Shaanxi Province), the ROC-AUC and PR-AUC values of USEE3 were 0.9680 and 0.9548, respectively, and the R2 of BSEE2 was 0.8255. Our method has good accuracy and generalization and can be flexibly used in the prediction of cryptic transmission in various regions.

Simple charts and hypothesis-driven statistics can no longer apprehend the content of information-rich clinical data. There is, therefore, a clear need for powerful interactive visualization tools enabling medical practitioners to perceive the patterns and insights gained by state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Here, we report an interactive graphical interface for use as the front end of a machine learning causal inference server (MIIC), to facilitate the visualization and comprehension by clinicians of relationships between clinically relevant variables. The widespread use of such tools, facilitating the interactive exploration of datasets, is crucial both for data visualization and for the generation of research hypotheses. We demonstrate the utility of the MIIC interactive interface, by exploring the clinical network of a large cohort of breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). This example highlights, in particular, the direct and indirect links between post-NAC clinical responses and patient survival. The MIIC interactive graphical interface has the potential to help clinicians identify actionable nodes and edges in clinical networks, thereby ultimately improving the patient care pathway. © 2022, The Author(s).","Chemotherapy; Diseases; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Patient monitoring; Visualization; biological marker; trastuzumab; Amount of information; Breast Cancer; Clinical data; Graphical interface; Health data; Interactive exploration; Interactive visualization tool; Medical record; Neoadjuvant chemotherapies; Simple++; Article; breast cancer; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; clinical practice; clinician; cohort analysis; comprehension; data visualization; female; human; machine learning; major clinical study; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; patient care; quality control; treatment response; Data visualization","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135872709"

A total of 251 normal breast images from patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery were used for training anomaly GAN network. GAN-based anomaly detection was used to calculate abnormalities as an AS, followed by standardization by using z-score. Then, we reviewed 61 breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy followed by reconstruction with autologous tissue or tissue expander. All patients were treated with adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) after reconstruction and computed tomography (CT) was performed at three-time points with a regular follow-up; before RT (Pre-RT), one year after RT (Post-1Y), and two years after RT (Post-2Y). Compared to Pre-RT, Post-1Y and Post-2Y demonstrated higher AS, indicating more abnormal cosmetic outcomes (Pre-RT vs. Post-1Y, P = 0.015 and Pre-RT vs. Post-2Y, P = 0.011). Pre-RT AS was higher in patients having major breast complications (P = 0.016). Patients with autologous reconstruction showed lower AS than those with tissue expander both at Pre-RT (2.00 vs. 4.19, P = 0.008) and Post-2Y (2.89 vs. 5.00, P = 0.010). Linear mixed effect model revealed that days after baseline were associated with increased AS (P = 0.007). Also, tissue expander was associated with steeper rise of AS, compared to autologous tissue (P = 0.015). Fractionation regimen was not associated with the change of AS (P = 0.389).

While some of these models are purely empiric, others are causal, built upon various hypotheses of AD pathophysiology, a complex and incompletely understood area of research. One of the most challenging problems in computational causal modeling is using a purely data-driven approach to derive the model’s parameters and the mathematical model itself, without any prior hypothesis bias. In this paper, we develop an innovative data-driven modeling approach to build and parameterize a causal model to characterize the trajectories of AD biomarkers. This approach integrates causal model learning, population parameterization, parameter sensitivity analysis, and personalized prediction. By applying this integrated approach to a large multicenter database of AD biomarkers, the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, several causal models for different AD stages are revealed. In addition, personalized models for each subject are calibrated and provide accurate predictions of future cognitive status. © 2022, The Author(s).","Forecasting; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neuroimaging; Scattering parameters; Sensitivity analysis; biological marker; Alzheimer; Alzheimers disease; Causal modeling; Clinical trial; Data driven; Data-driven approach; Disease biomarker; Explosive growth; Model discoveries; Pathophysiology; accuracy; algorithm; Alzheimer disease; Article; causal model; controlled study; disease exacerbation; human; mild cognitive impairment; personalized medicine; population model; prediction; sensitivity analysis; Biomarkers","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138092071"

Here, we report on the development and use of a low cost, noninvasive method to rapidly sniff out COVID-19 based on a portable electronic nose (GeNose C19) integrating an array of metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors, optimized feature extraction, and machine learning models. This approach was evaluated in profiling tests involving a total of 615 breath samples composed of 333 positive and 282 negative samples. The samples were obtained from 43 positive and 40 negative COVID-19 patients, respectively, and confirmed with RT-qPCR at two hospitals located in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Four different machine learning algorithms (i.e., linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, stacked multilayer perceptron, and deep neural network) were utilized to identify the top-performing pattern recognition methods and to obtain a high system detection accuracy (88–95%), sensitivity (86–94%), and specificity (88–95%) levels from the testing datasets.

We collect a dataset of clinical NLP projects (n = 94; £ = 41.97 m) funded by UK funders or the European Union’s funding programmes. Additionally, we extract details on 9 funders, 137 organisations, 139 persons and 431 research papers. Networks are created from timestamped data interlinking all entities, and network analysis is subsequently applied to generate insights. 431 publications are identified as part of a literature review, of which 107 are eligible for final analysis. Results show, not surprisingly, clinical NLP in the UK has increased substantially in the last 15 years: the total budget in the period of 2019–2022 was 80 times that of 2007–2010. However, the effort is required to deepen areas such as disease (sub-)phenotyping and broaden application domains. There is also a need to improve links between academia and industry and enable deployments in real-world settings for the realisation of clinical NLP’s great potential in care delivery. The major barriers include research and development access to hospital data, lack of capable computational resources in the right places, the scarcity of labelled data and barriers to sharing of pretrained models. © 2022, The Author(s).","Budget control; Natural language processing systems; Clinical research; European union; Evolution analysis; Extract informations; Free texts; High quality; Language processing; Natural languages; Text format; United kingdom; analytic method; clinical practice; community; eigenvector centrality; health survey; histogram; human; natural language processing; network analysis; ontology; publication; Review; stakeholder engagement; United Kingdom; Clinical research","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144630032"

Current quality assurance depends heavily on a physician peer-review process, which includes a review of the treatment plan’s dose and fractionation. Potentially, physicians may not identify errors during this manual peer review due to time constraints and caseload. A novel prescription anomaly detection algorithm is designed that utilizes historical data from the past to predict anomalous cases. Such a tool can serve as an electronic peer who will assist the peer-review process providing extra safety to the patients. In our primary model, we create two dissimilarity metrics, R and F. R defining how far a new patient’s prescription is from historical prescriptions. F represents how far away a patient’s feature set is from that of the group with an identical or similar prescription. We flag prescription if either metric is greater than specific optimized cut-off values. We use thoracic cancer patients (n = 2504) as an example and extracted seven features. Our testing set f1 score is between 73%-94% for different treatment technique groups. We also independently validate our results by conducting a mock peer review with three thoracic specialists.

In this study, we aimed to develop DeepMRDTR, a deep learning-based medical image interpretation system for the diagnosis of major respiratory diseases based on the automated identification of a wide range of radiological abnormalities through computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) from real-world, large-scale datasets. DeepMRDTR comprises four networks (two CT-Nets and two CXR-Nets) that exploit contrastive learning to generate pre-training parameters that are fine-tuned on the retrospective dataset collected from a single institution. The performance of DeepMRDTR was evaluated for abnormality identification and disease diagnosis on data from two different institutions: one was an internal testing dataset from the same institution as the training data and the second was collected from an external institution to evaluate the model generalizability and robustness to an unrelated population dataset. In such a difficult multi-class diagnosis task, our system achieved the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.856 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.843–0.868) and 0.841 (95%CI:0.832–0.887) for abnormality identification, and 0.900 (95%CI:0.872–0.958) and 0.866 (95%CI:0.832–0.887) for major respiratory diseases’ diagnosis on CT and CXR datasets, respectively. Furthermore, to achieve a clinically actionable diagnosis, we deployed a preliminary version of DeepMRDTR into the clinical workflow, which was performed on par with senior experts in disease diagnosis, with an AUC of 0.890 and a Cohen’s k of 0.746–0.877 at a reasonable timescale; these findings demonstrate the potential to accelerate the medical workflow to facilitate early diagnosis as a triage tool for respiratory diseases which supports improved clinical diagnoses and decision-making. © 2022, The Author(s).","Computerized tomography; Decision making; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Large dataset; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Population statistics; Statistical tests; Automated identification; Confidence interval; Diagnostic systems; Disease diagnosis; Global health; Image interpretation; Interpretation systems; Large-scale datasets; Patient population; Real-world; Pulmonary diseases","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137020069"

While purpose-built pulse oximeters can provide accurate blood-oxygen saturation (SpO2) readings that allow for diagnosis of hypoxemia, enabling this capability in unmodified smartphone cameras via a software update could give more people access to important information about their health. Towards this goal, we performed the first clinical development validation on a smartphone camera-based SpO2 sensing system using a varied fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) protocol, creating a clinically relevant validation dataset for solely smartphone-based contact PPG methods on a wider range of SpO2 values (70–100%) than prior studies (85–100%). We built a deep learning model using this data to demonstrate an overall MAE = 5.00% SpO2 while identifying positive cases of low SpO2 < 90% with 81% sensitivity and 79% specificity.

We develop artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted models using machine learning algorithms to identify a biomarker signature that predisposes high risk patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) to diabetic kidney disease based on clinical information, untargeted metabolomics, targeted lipidomics and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets. This involves 618 individuals who are split into training and testing cohorts of 557 and 61 subjects, respectively. Three models are developed. In model 1, the top 20 features selected by AI give an accuracy rate of 0.83 and an area under curve (AUC) of 0.89 when differentiating DM and non-DM individuals. In model 2, among DM patients, a biomarker signature of 10 AI-selected features gives an accuracy rate of 0.70 and an AUC of 0.76 when identifying subjects at high risk of renal impairment. In model 3, among non-DM patients, a biomarker signature of 25 AI-selected features gives an accuracy rate of 0.82 and an AUC of 0.76 when pinpointing subjects at high risk of chronic kidney disease. In addition, the performance of the three models is rigorously verified using an independent validation cohort. Intriguingly, analysis of the protein–protein interaction network of the genes containing the identified SNPs (RPTOR, CLPTM1L, ALDH1L1, LY6D, PCDH9, B3GNTL1, CDS1, ADCYAP and FAM53A) reveals that, at the molecular level, there seems to be interconnected factors that have an effect on the progression of renal impairment among DM patients. In conclusion, our findings reveal the potential of employing machine learning algorithms to augment traditional methods and our findings suggest what molecular mechanisms may underlie the complex interaction between DM and chronic kidney disease. Moreover, the development of our AI-assisted models will improve precision when diagnosing renal impairment in predisposed patients, both DM and non-DM. Finally, a large prospective cohort study is needed to validate the clinical utility and mechanistic implications of these biomarker signatures. © 2022, The Author(s).","Diagnosis; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Proteins; adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1; aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member L1; beta 1,3 n acetylglucosaminyltransferase like 1; biological marker; cdp diacylglycerol synthase 1; cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1 like; family with sequence similarity 53 member a; lymphocyte antigen 6 family member d; peptides and proteins; protocadherin 9; regulatory associated protein of mTOR; unclassified drug; 'omics'; Accuracy rate; Chronic kidney disease; Diabetes mellitus; Diabetics patients; High-dimensional; Higher-dimensional; Kidney disease; Machine learning algorithms; Three models; aged; area under the curve; Article; artificial intelligence; cohort analysis; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diabetic nephropathy; diabetic patient; diagnostic accuracy; disease predisposition; female; genome-wide association study; high risk patient; human; lipidomics; machine learning; major clinical study; male; metabolomics; molecular pathology; prospective study; protein protein interaction; single nucleotide polymorphism; Biomarkers","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141033151"

Globally, patients can experience diagnostic delays of ~6 to 12 years, which significantly hinders adequate management and places a significant financial burden on patients and the healthcare system. Through artificial intelligence (AI), it is possible to create models that can extract data patterns to act as inputs for developing interventions with predictive and diagnostic accuracies that are superior to conventional methods and current tools used in standards of care. This literature review explored the use of AI methods to address different clinical problems in endometriosis. Approximately 1309 unique records were found across four databases; among those, 36 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were eligible if they involved an AI approach or model to explore endometriosis pathology, diagnostics, prediction, or management and if they reported evaluation metrics (sensitivity and specificity) after validating their models. Only articles accessible in English were included in this review. Logistic regression was the most popular machine learning method, followed by decision tree algorithms, random forest, and support vector machines. Approximately 44.4% (n = 16) of the studies analyzed the predictive capabilities of AI approaches in patients with endometriosis, while 47.2% (n = 17) explored diagnostic capabilities, and 8.33% (n = 3) used AI to improve disease understanding. Models were built using different data types, including biomarkers, clinical variables, metabolite spectra, genetic variables, imaging data, mixed methods, and lesion characteristics. Regardless of the AI-based endometriosis application (either diagnostic or predictive), pooled sensitivities ranged from 81.7 to 96.7%, and pooled specificities ranged between 70.7 and 91.6%. Overall, AI models displayed good diagnostic and predictive capacity in detecting endometriosis using simple classification scenarios (i.e., differentiating between cases and controls), showing promising directions for AI in assessing endometriosis in the near future. This timely review highlighted an emerging area of interest in endometriosis and AI. It also provided recommendations for future research in this field to improve the reproducibility of results and comparability between models, and further test the capacity of these models to enhance diagnosis, prediction, and management in endometriosis patients. © 2022, Crown.","Diagnosis; Metabolites; Support vector machines; Clinical presentations; Clinical use; Condition; Conventional currents; Conventional methods; Data patterns; Diagnostic accuracy; Healthcare systems; Predictive accuracy; Scoping review; algorithm; artificial intelligence; decision tree; endometriosis; female; human; machine learning; prediction; predictive model; random forest; reproducibility; Review; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; Decision trees","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135573166"

For scholars, research into digital technologies in cardiovascular care has been relatively recent, thus it is important to understand the history of digital health technology in cardiovascular research—its emergence, rate of growth, hot topics, and its temporal evolution. The aim of this study was to analyse more than 16,000 articles in this domain based on their scientometric indicators. Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection was accessed and searched at several levels, including titles, abstracts, keywords, authors, sources and individual articles. Analysis examined the temporal shifts in research and scholarly focus based on keywords, networks of collaboration, topical divisions in relation to digital technologies, and influential publications. Findings showed this research area is growing exponentially. Co-citation analysis revealed twenty prominent research streams and identified variation in the magnitude of activities in each stream. A recent emergence of research activities in digital technology in cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR), out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), and arrythmia research was also demonstrated. Conversely, wearable technologies, activity tracking and electronic medical records research are now past their peak of reported research activity. With increasing amounts of novel technologies becoming available and more patients taking part in remote health care monitoring, further evaluation and research into digital technologies, including their long-term effectiveness, is needed. Furthermore, emerging technologies, which are evaluated and/or validated should be considered for implementation into clinical practice as treatment and prevention modalities for CVD. © 2023, The Author(s).","Cardiology; Information analysis; Medical computing; Wearable technology; Cardiovascular care; Cardiovascular disease; Digital technologies; Disease research; Health technology; Hot topics; Research activities; Scientometrics; Temporal evolution; Web of Science; cardiovascular disease; digital technology; electronic medical record; health behavior; heart arrhythmia; human; medical research; medication compliance; out of hospital cardiac arrest; rehabilitation care; Review; scientific literature; sedentary lifestyle; software; Diseases","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145438040"

This study assesses the short-term (first 70 days of eMM use) and long-term (one-year) effectiveness of an eMM system to reduce prescribing errors, and their potential and actual harm. We use a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial (SWCRCT) at a paediatric referral hospital, with eight clusters randomised for eMM implementation. We assess long-term effects from an additional random sample of medication orders one-year post-eMM. In the SWCRCT, errors that are potential adverse drug events (ADEs) are assessed for actual harm. The study comprises 35,260 medication orders for 4821 patients. Results show no significant change in overall prescribing error rates in the first 70 days of eMM use (incident rate ratio [IRR] 1.05 [95%CI 0.92–1.21], but a 62% increase (IRR 1.62 [95%CI 1.28–2.04]) in potential ADEs suggesting immediate risks to safety. One-year post-eMM, errors decline by 36% (IRR 0.64 [95%CI 0.56–0.72]) and high-risk medication errors decrease by 33% (IRR 0.67 [95%CI 0.51–0.88]) compared to pre-eMM. In all periods, dose error rates are more than double that of other error types. Few errors are associated with actual harm, but 71% [95%CI 50–86%] of patients with harm experienced a dose error. In the short-term, eMM implementation shows no improvement in error rates, and an increase in some errors. A year after eMM error rates significantly decline suggesting long-term benefits. eMM optimisation should focus on reducing dose errors due to their high frequency and capacity to cause harm. © 2022, The Author(s).","Pediatrics; Safety engineering; anticoagulant agent; antiinfective agent; antineoplastic agent; electrolyte; heparin; insulin; narcotic agent; opiate; potassium; sedative agent; Electronic medication management systems; Error rate; Error types; Incident rate ratio; Long-term effects; Medication errors; Medication management; Optimisations; Random sample; Randomized controlled trial; adverse drug reaction; Article; child; comparative study; controlled study; disease severity; dosing error; drug intoxication; drug monitoring; drug underdose; female; health hazard; human; interrater reliability; long term survival; major clinical study; male; medication error; multicenter study; New South Wales; patient referral; pediatric hospital; pediatric patient; prescribing error; randomized controlled trial; retrospective study; short term survival; tertiary care center; Errors","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143896238"

It is not clear how large clinical language models with billions of parameters can help medical AI systems utilize unstructured EHRs. In this study, we develop from scratch a large clinical language model—GatorTron—using >90 billion words of text (including >82 billion words of de-identified clinical text) and systematically evaluate it on five clinical NLP tasks including clinical concept extraction, medical relation extraction, semantic textual similarity, natural language inference (NLI), and medical question answering (MQA). We examine how (1) scaling up the number of parameters and (2) scaling up the size of the training data could benefit these NLP tasks. GatorTron models scale up the clinical language model from 110 million to 8.9 billion parameters and improve five clinical NLP tasks (e.g., 9.6% and 9.5% improvement in accuracy for NLI and MQA), which can be applied to medical AI systems to improve healthcare delivery.

However, concerns regarding the accuracy and safety of these symptom checkers have been raised. This systematic review evaluates the accuracy of symptom checkers in providing diagnoses and appropriate triage advice. MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched for studies that used either real or simulated patients to evaluate online or digital symptom checkers. The primary outcomes were the diagnostic and triage accuracy of the symptom checkers. The QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess study quality. Of the 177 studies retrieved, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. Researchers evaluated the accuracy of symptom checkers using a variety of medical conditions, including ophthalmological conditions, inflammatory arthritides and HIV. A total of 50% of the studies recruited real patients, while the remainder used simulated cases. The diagnostic accuracy of the primary diagnosis was low across included studies (range: 19–37.9%) and varied between individual symptom checkers, despite consistent symptom data input. Triage accuracy (range: 48.8–90.1%) was typically higher than diagnostic accuracy. Overall, the diagnostic and triage accuracy of symptom checkers are variable and of low accuracy. Given the increasing push towards adopting this class of technologies across numerous health systems, this study demonstrates that reliance upon symptom checkers could pose significant patient safety hazards. Large-scale primary studies, based upon real-world data, are warranted to demonstrate the adequate performance of these technologies in a manner that is non-inferior to current best practices. Moreover, an urgent assessment of how these systems are regulated and implemented is required. © 2022, The Author(s).","Health hazards; Condition; Data input; Diagnostic accuracy; Health technology; Inflammatory arthritis; Medical conditions; Simulated patients; Study qualities; Systematic Review; Web of Science; clinical assessment tool; diagnostic accuracy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; patient safety; patient triage; Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies; Review; systematic review; telehealth; Diagnosis","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136530520"

Using a school-based cohort in Singapore comprising of 998 children (aged 6–12 years old), we train and perform primary validation of the DLS using 7456 baseline fundus images of 1878 eyes; with external validation using an independent test dataset of 821 baseline fundus images of 189 eyes together with clinical data (age, gender, race, parental myopia, and baseline spherical equivalent (SE)). We derive three distinct algorithms – image, clinical and mix (image + clinical) models to predict high myopia development (SE ≤ −6.00 diopter) during teenage years (5 years later, age 11–17). Model performance is evaluated using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Our image models (Primary dataset AUC 0.93–0.95; Test dataset 0.91–0.93), clinical models (Primary dataset AUC 0.90–0.97; Test dataset 0.93–0.94) and mixed (image + clinical) models (Primary dataset AUC 0.97; Test dataset 0.97–0.98) achieve clinically acceptable performance. The addition of 1 year SE progression variable has minimal impact on the DLS performance (clinical model AUC 0.98 versus 0.97 in primary dataset, 0.97 versus 0.94 in test dataset; mixed model AUC 0.99 versus 0.97 in primary dataset, 0.95 versus 0.98 in test dataset). Thus, our DLS allows prediction of the development of high myopia by teenage years amongst school-going children. This has potential utility as a clinical-decision support tool to identify “at-risk” children for early intervention. © 2023, The Author(s).","Decision support systems; Deep learning; Forecasting; Ophthalmology; Risk assessment; Statistical tests; Acceptable performance; Clinical data; Fundus image; Fundus imaging; Image modeling; Modeling performance; Myopia development; Myopia progression; Receiver operating curves; Singapore; adolescent; algorithm; area under the curve; Article; biometry; child; clinical study; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross validation; decision support system; deep learning; deep neural network; eye fundus; female; high myopia; human; imaging; major clinical study; male; ophthalmoscopy; optometry; parent; performance; prediction; random forest; retina image; risk assessment; Singapore; ultrasound; Learning systems","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146884981"

The benefits of improved movement health have long been recognized and are wide-ranging from improving athletic performance to helping ease of performing simple tasks, but only recently has this concept been put into practice by clinicians and quantitatively studied by researchers. With digital health and movement monitoring becoming more ubiquitous in society, smartphone applications represent a promising avenue for quantifying, monitoring, and improving the movement health of an individual. In this paper, we validate Halo Movement, a movement health assessment which utilizes the front-facing camera of a smartphone and applies computer vision and machine learning algorithms to quantify movement health and its sub-criteria of mobility, stability, and posture through a sequence of five exercises/activities. On a diverse cohort of 150 participants of various ages, body types, and ability levels, we find moderate to strong statistically significant correlations between the Halo Movement assessment overall score, metrics from sensor-based 3D motion capture, and scores from a sequence of 13 standardized functional movement tests. Further, the smartphone assessment is able to differentiate regular healthy individuals from professional movement athletes (e.g., dancers, cheerleaders) and from movement impaired participants, with higher resolution than that of existing functional movement screening tools and thus may be more appropriate than the existing tests for quantifying functional movement in able-bodied individuals. These results support using Halo Movement’s overall score as a valid assessment of movement health. © 2022, The Author(s).","Cameras; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Smartphones; Stability criteria; Activities of Daily Living; Assessment of movements; Athletic performance; Camera-based; Functional movements; Health monitoring; Movement monitoring; Simple++; Smart phones; Smart-phone cameras; adult; age; aged; aptitude; Article; athletic performance; body movement; body position; clinical test of sensor interaction in balance; closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability test; cohort analysis; computer vision; controlled study; correlation coefficient; daily life activity; dancing; deep neural network; exercise; female; functional reach test; functional status; gymnastics; Halo Movement score; human; hurdle step test; instrument validation; intermethod comparison; kinematics; locomotion; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; motor dysfunction; motor dysfunction assessment; motor function test; movement (physiology); performance indicator; physical mobility; plumb line test; professional athlete; reach behind back test; sharpened romberg test; single leg hop test; sit and reach test; star excursion balance test; unilateral hip bridge endurance test; y balance test; yoga; Health","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137978930"

Through these virtual storefronts Apple and Google act as the distributor (and sometimes, importer) of many thousands of health and wellness apps into the EU, some of which have a medical purpose. As a result of changes to EU law which came into effect in May 2021, they must now ensure that apps are compliant with medical devices regulation and to inform authorities of serious incidents arising from their use. The extent to which these new rules are being complied with in practice is uneven, and in some areas unclear. In light of EU legislation related to competition, which came into effect in November 2022, it is also unclear how conflicts of interest can be managed between Apple and Google’s roles as gateway duopoly importers and distributors whilst also developers of their own competitive health products. Finally, with the proposed European health data space regulation, wellness apps will be voluntarily registered and labelled in a fashion more like medical devices than consumer software. We explore the implications of these new regulations and propose future models that could resolve the apparent conflicts.

While there is no cure, levodopa therapy has been shown to mitigate symptoms. A patient on levodopa experiences cycles in the severity of their symptoms, characterized by an ON state—when the drug is active—and an OFF state—when symptoms worsen as the drug wears off. The longitudinal progression of the disease is monitored using episodic assessments performed by trained physicians in the clinic, such as the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Lately, there has been an effort in the field to develop continuous, objective measures of motor symptoms based on wearable sensors and other remote monitoring devices. In this work, we present an effort towards such a solution that uses a single wearable inertial sensor to automatically assess the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) of a Parkinson’s disease patient. Sensor data was collected from two independent studies of subjects performing the UPDRS test and then used to train and validate a convolutional neural network model. Given the typical limited size of such studies we also employed the use of generative adversarial networks to improve the performance of deep-learning models that usually require larger amounts of data for training. We show that for a 2-min walk test, our method’s predicted PIGD scores can be used to identify a patient’s ON/OFF states better than a physician evaluated on the same criteria. This result paves the way for more reliable, continuous tracking of Parkinson’s disease symptoms. © 2022, The Author(s).","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Neurodegenerative diseases; Wearable sensors; levodopa; Disease ratings; Gait disorders; Levodopa; Limb rigidity; Monitoring device; Neurodegenerative disorders; Objective measure; Postural instabilities; Rating scale; Remote monitoring; Article; balance impairment; body equilibrium; clinical article; controlled study; disease exacerbation; gait disorder; human; motor dysfunction; Parkinson disease; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; walk test; Generative adversarial networks","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138192589"

While of great importance, these considerations also reflect a model-centric approach seen in published clinical AI research, which focuses on optimising architecture and performance of an AI model on best available datasets. However, even robustly built models using state-of-the-art algorithms may fail once tested in realistic environments due to unpredictability of real-world conditions, out-of-dataset scenarios, characteristics of deployment infrastructure, and lack of added value to clinical workflows relative to cost and potential clinical risks. In this perspective, we define a vertically integrated approach to AI development that incorporates early, cross-disciplinary, consideration of impact evaluation, data lifecycles, and AI production, and explore its implementation in two contrasting AI development pipelines: a scalable “AI factory” (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, United States), and an end-to-end cervical cancer screening platform for resource poor settings (Paps AI, Mbarara, Uganda). We provide practical recommendations for implementers, and discuss future challenges and novel approaches (including a decentralised federated architecture being developed in the NHS (AI4VBH, London, UK)). Growth in global clinical AI research continues unabated, and introduction of vertically integrated teams and development practices can increase the translational potential of future clinical AI projects. © 2022, The Author(s).","Clinical research; Investments; Life cycle; Risk perception; 'current; Algorithms development; Architecture and performance; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Artificial intelligence research; External validities; Intelligence models; Real-world; Realistic environments; State-of-the-art algorithms; algorithm; Article; artificial intelligence; cancer screening; clinician; health data; human; life cycle; medical research; methodology; resource allocation; uterine cervix cancer; vertically integrated approach; Artificial intelligence","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139225808"

Research on the ageing of bones, especially the skull, are paid much attention in recent years. In this study, a novel deep learning method representing the ageing-related dynamic attention (ARDA) is proposed. The proposed method can quantitatively display the ageing salience of the bones and their change patterns with age on lateral cephalometric radiographs images (LCR) images containing the craniofacial and cervical spine. An age estimation-based deep learning model based on 14142 LCR images from 4 to 40 years old individuals is trained to extract ageing-related features, and based on these features the ageing salience maps are generated by the Grad-CAM method. All ageing salience maps with the same age are merged as an ARDA map corresponding to that age. Ageing salience maps show that ARDA is mainly concentrated in three regions in LCR images: the teeth, craniofacial, and cervical spine regions. Furthermore, the dynamic distribution of ARDA at different ages and instances in LCR images is quantitatively analyzed. The experimental results on 3014 cases show that ARDA can accurately reflect the development and degeneration patterns in LCR images. © 2022, The Author(s).","Bone; Learning systems; Radiography; Cervical spine; Change patterns; Craniofacial; Human bones; Human muscles; Human skin; Learning methods; Physiological characteristics; Radiograph images; Salience map; adolescent; adult; age; age determination; aging; Article; cephalometry; cervical spine; child; craniofacial morphology; deep learning; degenerative disease; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; Deep learning","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139115403"

Repeatability is a key attribute of model robustness. Ideal repeatable models output predictions without variation during independent tests carried out under similar conditions. However, slight variations, though not ideal, may be unavoidable and acceptable in practice. During model development and evaluation, much attention is given to classification performance while model repeatability is rarely assessed, leading to the development of models that are unusable in clinical practice. In this work, we evaluate the repeatability of four model types (binary classification, multi-class classification, ordinal classification, and regression) on images that were acquired from the same patient during the same visit. We study the each model’s performance on four medical image classification tasks from public and private datasets: knee osteoarthritis, cervical cancer screening, breast density estimation, and retinopathy of prematurity. Repeatability is measured and compared on ResNet and DenseNet architectures. Moreover, we assess the impact of sampling Monte Carlo dropout predictions at test time on classification performance and repeatability. Leveraging Monte Carlo predictions significantly increases repeatability, in particular at the class boundaries, for all tasks on the binary, multi-class, and ordinal models leading to an average reduction of the 95% limits of agreement by 16% points and of the class disagreement rate by 7% points. The classification accuracy improves in most settings along with the repeatability. Our results suggest that beyond about 20 Monte Carlo iterations, there is no further gain in repeatability. In addition to the higher test-retest agreement, Monte Carlo predictions are better calibrated which leads to output probabilities reflecting more accurately the true likelihood of being correctly classified. © 2022, The Author(s).","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Diagnosis; Medical imaging; Monte Carlo methods; Classification performance; Clinical workflow; Condition; Key attributes; Learning models; Model outputs; Model robustness; Monte Carlo predictions; Reliable models; Robust modeling; Article; binary classification; breast density; calibration; cancer screening; classification algorithm; comparative study; deep learning; DenseNet; disease severity; human; knee osteoarthritis; limit of agreement; machine learning; measurement accuracy; measurement repeatability; Monte Carlo method; multiclass classification; ordinal classification; prediction; regression model; reproducibility; residual neural network; retrolental fibroplasia; test retest reliability; uterine cervix cancer; uterine cervix carcinoma in situ; Forecasting","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142085581"

In the more general XAI (eXplainable AI) literature, there has been some convergence on explainability meaning model-agnostic techniques that augment a complex model (with internal mechanics intractable for human understanding) with a simpler model argued to deliver results that humans can comprehend. Given the differing usage and intended meaning of the term “explainability” in AI and ML, we propose instead to approximate model/algorithm explainability by understandability defined as a function of transparency and interpretability. These concepts are easier to articulate, to “ground” in our understanding of how algorithms and models operate and are used more consistently in the literature. We describe the TIFU (Transparency and Interpretability For Understandability) framework and examine how this applies to the landscape of AI/ML in mental health research. We argue that the need for understandablity is heightened in psychiatry because data describing the syndromes, outcomes, disorders and signs/symptoms possess probabilistic relationships to each other—as do the tentative aetiologies and multifactorial social- and psychological-determinants of disorders. If we develop and deploy AI/ML models, ensuring human understandability of the inputs, processes and outputs of these models is essential to develop trustworthy systems fit for deployment. © 2023, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Approximate modeling; Artificial intelligence learning; Complex model; Human understanding; Interpretability; Machine-learning; Mental health; Model algorithms; Simple modeling; Understandability; algorithm; artificial intelligence; human; human experiment; machine learning; mental health; mental health research; psychiatry; review; Transparency","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146612095"

It is an open question whether deep learning methods using automated data integration with minimal pre-processing of mixed data domains such as free text, medical history and high-frequency data can provide discrete-time survival estimates for individual ICU patients. We trained a deep learning model on data from patients admitted to ten ICUs in the Capital Region of Denmark and the Region of Southern Denmark between 2011 and 2018. Inspired by natural language processing we mapped the electronic patient record data to an embedded representation and fed the data to a recurrent neural network with a multi-label output layer representing the chance of survival at different follow-up times. We evaluated the performance using the time-dependent concordance index. In addition, we quantified and visualized the drivers of survival predictions using the SHAP methodology. We included 37,355 admissions of 29,417 patients in our study.

In contrast to self-reported measures, wearable accelerometers can provide more precise and reproducible activity quantification. Using wrist-worn accelerometry data from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study, we test associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) – both total MVPA minutes and whether MVPA is above a guideline-based threshold of ≥150 min/week—and incidence of 697 diseases using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, Townsend Deprivation Index, educational attainment, diet quality, alcohol use, blood pressure, anti-hypertensive use. We correct for multiplicity at a false discovery rate of 1%. We perform analogous testing using self-reported MVPA. Among 96,244 adults wearing accelerometers for one week (age 62 ± 8 years), MVPA is associated with 373 (54%) tested diseases over a median 6.3 years of follow-up. Greater MVPA is overwhelmingly associated with lower disease risk (98% of associations) with hazard ratios (HRs) ranging 0.70–0.98 per 150 min increase in weekly MVPA, and associations spanning all 16 disease categories tested. Overall, associations with lower disease risk are enriched for cardiac (16%), digestive (14%), endocrine/metabolic (10%), and respiratory conditions (8%) (chi-square p < 0.01). Similar patterns are observed using the guideline-based threshold of ≥150 MVPA min/week. Some of the strongest associations with guideline-adherent activity include lower risks of incident heart failure (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55–0.77), type 2 diabetes (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.58–0.71), cholelithiasis (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54–0.70), and chronic bronchitis (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33–0.54). When assessed within 456,374 individuals providing self-reported MVPA, effect sizes for guideline-adherent activity are substantially smaller (e.g., heart failure HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.80–0.88).

Specifically, AI systems leveraging multiple data sources and input modalities are poised to become a viable method to deliver more accurate results and deployable pipelines across a wide range of applications. In this work, we propose and evaluate a unified Holistic AI in Medicine (HAIM) framework to facilitate the generation and testing of AI systems that leverage multimodal inputs. Our approach uses generalizable data pre-processing and machine learning modeling stages that can be readily adapted for research and deployment in healthcare environments. We evaluate our HAIM framework by training and characterizing 14,324 independent models based on HAIM-MIMIC-MM, a multimodal clinical database (N = 34,537 samples) containing 7279 unique hospitalizations and 6485 patients, spanning all possible input combinations of 4 data modalities (i.e., tabular, time-series, text, and images), 11 unique data sources and 12 predictive tasks. We show that this framework can consistently and robustly produce models that outperform similar single-source approaches across various healthcare demonstrations (by 6–33%), including 10 distinct chest pathology diagnoses, along with length-of-stay and 48 h mortality predictions. We also quantify the contribution of each modality and data source using Shapley values, which demonstrates the heterogeneity in data modality importance and the necessity of multimodal inputs across different healthcare-relevant tasks. The generalizable properties and flexibility of our Holistic AI in Medicine (HAIM) framework could offer a promising pathway for future multimodal predictive systems in clinical and operational healthcare settings. © 2022, The Author(s).","Data handling; Diagnosis; Health care; Artificial intelligence in medicine; Artificial intelligence systems; Data input; Data preprocessing; Data-source; Health care application; Input modalities; Multi-modal; Multimodal inputs; Multiple data sources; adult; article; artificial intelligence; controlled study; female; hospitalization; human; length of stay; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mortality; prediction; thorax; time series analysis; Artificial intelligence","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138345961"

These measurements have relatively low information content and are usually limited in frequency. Wearable sensors, such as activity monitors, enable remote measurement of parameters associated with physical activity but have not been widely explored beyond measurement of daily step count. Here we report on results from a cohort of 22 individuals with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) who were provided with a Fitbit activity monitor (Fitbit Charge HR®) between two clinic visits (18.4 ± 12.2 weeks). At each clinical visit, a maximum of 26 measurements were recorded (19 categorical and 7 continuous). From analysis of the minute-to-minute step rate and heart rate we derive several metrics associated with physical activity and cardiovascular function. These metrics are used to identify subgroups within the cohort and to compare to clinical parameters. Several Fitbit metrics are strongly correlated to continuous clinical parameters. Using a thresholding approach, we show that many Fitbit metrics result in statistically significant differences in clinical parameters between subgroups, including those associated with physical status, cardiovascular function, pulmonary function, as well as biomarkers from blood tests. These results highlight the fact that daily step count is only one of many metrics that can be derived from activity monitors. © 2022, The Author(s).","Blood pressure; Cardiology; Surveys; biological marker; Activities of Daily Living; Activity monitors; Cardiovascular function; Clinical parameters; Clinical settings; Health status; Measurements of; Physical activity; Physical health; Walk tests; adult; Article; cardiovascular function; clinical article; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; daily life activity; endurance; exercise intensity; female; fitness; health status; heart rate; human; lung function; male; middle aged; mobilization; observational study; physical activity; physical capacity; prospective study; pulmonary hypertension; six minute walk test; step count; usability; walking distance; Wearable sensors","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141682195"

While federated data access concepts exist, they are technically and organizationally difficult to realize. An alternative approach would be to exchange synthetic patient data instead. In this work, we introduce the Multimodal Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (MultiNODEs), a hybrid, multimodal AI approach, which allows for generating highly realistic synthetic patient trajectories on a continuous time scale, hence enabling smooth interpolation and extrapolation of clinical studies. Our proposed method can integrate both static and longitudinal data, and implicitly handles missing values. We demonstrate the capabilities of MultiNODEs by applying them to real patient-level data from two independent clinical studies and simulated epidemiological data of an infectious disease. © 2022, The Author(s).","Continuous time systems; Health insurance; Hospital data processing; Laws and legislation; Population statistics; Clinical study; Data access; Generalization ability; Insurance providers; Legal regulation; Multi-modal; Patient data; Pharmaceutical company; Statistic modeling; Synthetic data; adult; Alzheimer disease; area under the curve; Article; artificial intelligence; autoencoder; Bayesian network; benchmarking; comparative study; controlled study; epidemiological data; feed forward neural network; genetic marker; genotype; human; machine learning; major clinical study; mathematical parameters; Multimodal Neural Ordinary Differential Equation; Parkinson disease; patient coding; recurrent neural network; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; Ordinary differential equations","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136699769"

Sensor derived digital measures of health, such as digital biomarkers or digital clinical outcome assessments, may be used to monitor health status or the risk of adverse events like falls. Current research around such digital measures has largely focused on exploring the use of few individual measures obtained through mobile devices. However, especially for long-term applications in older adults, this choice of technology may not be ideal and could further add to the digital divide. Moreover, large-scale systems biology approaches, like genomics, have already proven beneficial in precision medicine, making it plausible that the same could also hold for remote-health monitoring. In this context, we introduce and describe a zero-interaction digital exhaust: a set of 1268 digital measures that cover large parts of a person’s activity, behavior and physiology. Making this approach more inclusive of older adults, we base this set entirely on contactless, zero-interaction sensing technologies. Applying the resulting digital exhaust to real-world data, we then demonstrate the possibility to create multiple ageing relevant digital clinical outcome assessments. Paired with modern machine learning, we find these assessments to be surprisingly powerful and often on-par with mobile approaches. Lastly, we highlight the possibility to discover novel digital biomarkers based on this large-scale approach. © 2022, The Author(s).","Biomarkers; Genome; Health risks; Large scale systems; mHealth; Risk assessment; biological marker; Clinical outcome; Health status; Healthcare systems; Older adults; Outcome assessment; Population aging; Pro-active approach; Remote health monitoring; Sensing devices; Systems approach; aged; aging; Article; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical outcome; demographics; descriptive research; digital divide; digital technology; Edmonton Frail Scale; female; frailty; genomics; Geriatric Depression Scale; home monitoring; human; late life depression; machine learning; male; mild cognitive impairment; Montreal cognitive assessment; patient monitoring; Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment; personalized medicine; phenotype; remote sensing; senescence; systems biology; timed up and go test; zero interaction digital exhaust; Digital devices","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136150988"

We create an artificial intelligence system (ENDOANGEL-GEV) containing six models to segment GEV and to classify the grades (grades 1–3) and red color signs (RC, RC0-RC3) of varices. It also summarizes changes in the above results with region in real time. ENDOANGEL-GEV is trained using 6034 images from 1156 cirrhotic patients across three hospitals (dataset 1) and validated on multicenter datasets with 11009 images from 141 videos (dataset 2) and in a prospective study recruiting 161 cirrhotic patients from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (dataset 3). In dataset 1, ENDOANGEL-GEV achieves intersection over union values of 0.8087 for segmenting esophageal varices and 0.8141 for gastric varices. In dataset 2, the system maintains fairly accuracy across images from three hospitals. In dataset 3, ENDOANGEL-GEV surpasses attended endoscopists in detecting RC of GEV and classifying grades (p < 0.001). When ranking the risk of patients combined with the Child‒Pugh score, ENDOANGEL-GEV outperforms endoscopists for esophageal varices (p < 0.001) and shows comparable performance for gastric varices (p = 0.152). Compared with endoscopists, ENDOANGEL-GEV may help 12.31% (16/130) more patients receive the right intervention. We establish an interpretable system for the endoscopic diagnosis and risk stratification of GEV. It will assist in detecting the first bleeding risk factors accurately and expanding the scope of quantitative measurement of diseases. © 2022, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Endoscopy; Patient treatment; Risk assessment; Artificial intelligence systems; Bleedings; Measurements of; Performance; Prospective study; Quantitative measurement; Real- time; Risk factors; Risk stratification; Video dataset; adult; aged; Article; artificial intelligence; Child Pugh score; endoscopy; esophagus varices bleeding; female; human; information processing; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; prospective study; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; risk factor; stomach varices bleeding; videorecording; Hospitals","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144311494"

Accurate prediction of successful use is challenging, and augmentation of the physical exam with ultrasound has become routine. Herein, we propose a point-of-care tool based on machine learning to enhance prediction of successful unassisted radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) use. Our analysis includes pooled patient-level data from 704 patients undergoing new radiocephalic AVF creation, eligible for hemodialysis, and enrolled in the 2014–2019 international multicenter PATENCY-1 or PATENCY-2 randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome being predicted is successful unassisted AVF use within 1-year, defined as 2-needle cannulation for hemodialysis for ≥90 days without preceding intervention. Logistic, penalized logistic (lasso and elastic net), decision tree, random forest, and boosted tree classification models were built with a training, tuning, and testing paradigm using a combination of baseline clinical characteristics and 4–6 week ultrasound parameters. Performance assessment includes receiver operating characteristic curves, precision-recall curves, calibration plots, and decision curves. All modeling approaches except the decision tree have similar discrimination performance and comparable net-benefit (area under the ROC curve 0.78–0.81, accuracy 69.1–73.6%). Model performance is superior to Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative and University of Alabama at Birmingham ultrasound threshold criteria. The lasso model is presented as the final model due to its parsimony, retaining only 3 covariates: larger outflow vein diameter, higher flow volume, and absence of >50% luminal stenosis. A point-of-care online calculator is deployed to facilitate AVF assessment in the clinic. © 2022, The Author(s).","Dialysis; Forecasting; Hemodialyzers; Machine learning; Ultrasonics; Accurate prediction; Arteriovenous fistulas; Cannulations; Clinical tasks; Elastic net; Haemodialysis; Machine-learning; On-machines; Point of care; Randomized controlled trial; adult; arteriovenous fistula; Article; calibration; clinical assessment; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; decision tree; echography; female; hemodialysis; human; kidney disease; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study (topic); outcome assessment; point of care ultrasound; prediction; radiocephalic; radiological parameters; random forest; randomized controlled trial (topic); recall; stenosis; vein diameter; Decision trees","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140479569"

How recovery evolves during the first 30 days after cardiac surgery is not well-understood. A digital platform may enable granular quantification of recovery by frequently capturing patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) that can be clinically implemented to support recovery. We conduct a prospective cohort study using a digital platform to measure recovery after cardiac surgery using a PROM sent every 3 days for 30 days after surgery to characterize recovery in multiple domains (e.g., pain, sleep, activities of daily living, anxiety) and to identify factors related to the patient’s perception of overall recovery. We enroll patients who underwent cardiac surgery at a tertiary center between January 2019 and March 2020 and automatically deliver PROMs and reminders electronically. Of the 10 surveys delivered per patient, 8 (IQR 6–10) are completed. Patients who experienced postoperative complications more commonly belong to the worst overall recovery trajectory. Of the 12 domains modeled, only the worst anxiety trajectory is associated with the worse overall recovery trajectory membership, suggesting that even when patients struggle in the recovery of other domains, the patient may still feel progress in their recovery. We demonstrate that using a digital platform, automated PROM data collection, and characterization of multi-domain recovery trajectories is feasible and likely implementable in clinical practice. Overall recovery may be impacted by complications, while slow progress in constituent domains may still allow for the perception of overall recovery progression. © 2022, The Author(s).","Cardiovascular surgery; Heart; Trajectories; creatinine; Activities of Daily Living; Cardiac-surgery; Cohort studies; Digital platforms; Multi-domains; Multiple domains; Outcome measures; Patient-reported outcomes; Prospectives; Support recoveries; adult; aged; anxiety; aortic surgery; aortic valve replacement; Article; assisted ventilation; automation; Caucasian; cerebrovascular disease; clinical practice; cohort analysis; coronary artery bypass graft; daily life activity; demographics; descriptive research; diabetes mellitus; digital technology; elective surgery; emergency surgery; female; health survey; heart ejection fraction; heart surgery; human; hygiene; hypertension; limit of quantitation; liver disease; major clinical study; male; mitral valve replacement; mitral valve surgery; nociception; pain; patient attitude; patient decision making; patient selection; patient-reported outcome; pneumonia; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; prospective study; questionnaire; reoperation; restlessness; robot assisted surgery; self care; sleep; sternotomy; surgery; surgical infection; tertiary care center; transient ischemic attack; treatment response; venous thromboembolism; Recovery","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144622935"

Initially, participants had paired HBM and CTG examinations performed in the clinic. Women then used the HBM unsupervised and rated the experience. Sixty-three women had paired clinic-based HBM and CTG recordings, providing 6982 fetal heart rate measures for point-to-point comparison from 126 min of continuous recording. The accuracy of the HBM was excellent, with limits of agreement (95%) for mean fetal heart rate (FHR) between 0.72 and −1.78 beats per minute. The FHR was detected on all occasions and confirmed to be different from the maternal heart rate. Both methods were equally interpretable by Obstetricians, and had similar signal loss ratios. Thirty-four (100%) women successfully detected the FHR and obtained clinically useful cardiographic data using the device at home unsupervised. They achieved the required length of recording required for non-stress test analysis. The monitor ranked in the 96–100th percentile for usability and learnability.

A systematic search was conducted for trial-based economic evaluations published before 10th May 2021. Electronic databases (including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, PSYNDEX, and NHS Economic Evaluations Database) were searched for randomized controlled trials examining IMIs targeting mental disorders and symptoms and conducting a full health economic evaluation. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed. Cost-effectiveness was assumed at or below £30,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Of the 4044 studies, 36 economic evaluations were reviewed. Guided IMIs were likely to be cost-effective in depression and anxiety. The quality of most evaluations was good, albeit with some risks of bias. Heterogeneity across studies was high because of factors such as different costing methods, design, comparison groups, and outcomes used. IMIs for anxiety and depression have potential to be cost-effective. However, more research is needed into unguided (preventive) IMIs with active control conditions (e.g., treatment as usual) and longer time horizon across a wider range of disorders.

Deconstructing a procedure into discrete instrument-tissue “gestures” is a emerging way to understand surgery. To establish this paradigm in a procedure where performance is the most important factor for patient outcomes, we identify 34,323 individual gestures performed in 80 nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomies from two international medical centers. Gestures are classified into nine distinct dissection gestures (e.g., hot cut) and four supporting gestures (e.g., retraction). Our primary outcome is to identify factors impacting a patient’s 1-year erectile function (EF) recovery after radical prostatectomy. We find that less use of hot cut and more use of peel/push are statistically associated with better chance of 1-year EF recovery. Our results also show interactions between surgeon experience and gesture types—similar gesture selection resulted in different EF recovery rates dependent on surgeon experience. To further validate this framework, two teams independently constructe distinct machine learning models using gesture sequences vs. traditional clinical features to predict 1-year EF. In both models, gesture sequences are able to better predict 1-year EF (Team 1: AUC 0.77, 95% CI 0.73–0.81; Team 2: AUC 0.68, 95% CI 0.66–0.70) than traditional clinical features (Team 1: AUC 0.69, 95% CI 0.65–0.73; Team 2: AUC 0.65, 95% CI 0.62–0.68). Our results suggest that gestures provide a granular method to objectively indicate surgical performance and outcomes.

Using large echocardiography datasets from two healthcare systems, we test whether it is possible to predict age, race, and sex from cardiac ultrasound images using deep learning algorithms and assess the impact of varying confounding variables. Using a total of 433,469 videos from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and 99,909 videos from Stanford Medical Center, we trained video-based convolutional neural networks to predict age, sex, and race. We found that deep learning models were able to identify age and sex, while unable to reliably predict race. Without considering confounding differences between categories, the AI model predicted sex with an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI 0.84–0.86), age with a mean absolute error of 9.12 years (95% CI 9.00–9.25), and race with AUCs ranging from 0.63 to 0.71. When predicting race, we show that tuning the proportion of confounding variables (age or sex) in the training data significantly impacts model AUC (ranging from 0.53 to 0.85), while sex and age prediction was not particularly impacted by adjusting race proportion in the training dataset AUC of 0.81–0.83 and 0.80–0.84, respectively. This suggests significant proportion of AI’s performance on predicting race could come from confounding features being detected. Further work remains to identify the particular imaging features that associate with demographic information and to better understand the risks of demographic identification in medical AI as it pertains to potentially perpetuating bias and disparities. © 2022, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Forecasting; Hospitals; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Population statistics; Cardiac ultrasound; Confounder; Convolutional neural network; Healthcare systems; Learning models; Mean absolute error; Medical center; Stanford; Training data; Ultrasound images; article; confounding variable; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; demographics; diagnostic imaging; echocardiography; female; health care system; human; male; mean absolute error; prediction; race; videorecording; Medical imaging","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144600783"

An approach to realising this potential is the digital twin concept, whereby a virtual representation of a patient is constructed and receives real-time updates of a range of data variables in order to predict disease and optimise treatment selection for the real-life patient. We explored the term digital twin, its defining concepts, the challenges as an emerging field, and potentially important applications in CVD. A mapping review was undertaken using a systematic search of peer-reviewed literature. Industry-based participants and patent applications were identified through web-based sources. Searches of Compendex, EMBASE, Medline, ProQuest and Scopus databases yielded 88 papers related to cardiovascular conditions (28%, n = 25), non-cardiovascular conditions (41%, n = 36), and general aspects of the health digital twin (31%, n = 27). Fifteen companies with a commercial interest in health digital twin or simulation modelling had products focused on CVD. The patent search identified 18 applications from 11 applicants, of which 73% were companies and 27% were universities. Three applicants had cardiac-related inventions. For CVD, digital twin research within industry and academia is recent, interdisciplinary, and established globally. Overall, the applications were numerical simulation models, although precursor models exist for the real-time cyber-physical system characteristic of a true digital twin. Implementation challenges include ethical constraints and clinical barriers to the adoption of decision tools derived from artificial intelligence systems. © 2022, The Author(s).","Cardiology; Diagnosis; Embedded systems; Patents and inventions; Patient treatment; Cardiovascular disease; Condition; Data variables; Interdisciplinary fields; Phenotyping; Potential benefits; Real-time updates; Systematic searches; Treatment selection; Virtual representations; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; big data; cardiovascular disease; clinical decision making; cloud computing; computational fluid dynamics; computer model; computer security; convolutional neural network; data integration; data mining; data processing; data protection; digital twin; finite element analysis; health care quality; health legislation; human; interdisciplinary research; internet of things; machine learning; medical ethics; medical research; patent; personalized medicine; proof of concept; Review; statistical model; trust; Diseases","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137102205"

Mobile health tools, including wearable sensors, have great potential in this space, but have been underutilized. Of specific interest are digital biomarkers, or end-user generated physiologic or behavioral measurements that correlate with health or pathology. The current manuscript describes a longitudinal, observational study of adult patients receiving opioid analgesics for acute painful conditions. Participants in the study are monitored with a wrist-worn E4 sensor, during which time physiologic parameters (heart rate/variability, electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and accelerometry) are collected continuously. Opioid use events are recorded via electronic medical record and self-report. Three-hundred thirty-nine discreet dose opioid events from 36 participant are analyzed among 2070 h of sensor data. Fifty-one features are extracted from the data and initially compared pre- and post-opioid administration, and subsequently are used to generate machine learning models. Model performance is compared based on individual and treatment characteristics. The best performing machine learning model to detect opioid administration is a Channel-Temporal Attention-Temporal Convolutional Network (CTA-TCN) model using raw data from the wearable sensor. History of intravenous drug use is associated with better model performance, while middle age, and co-administration of non-narcotic analgesia or sedative drugs are associated with worse model performance. These characteristics may be candidate input features for future opioid detection model iterations. Once mature, this technology could provide clinicians with actionable data on opioid use patterns in real-world settings, and predictive analytics for early identification of opioid use disorder risk. © 2022, The Author(s).","Biomarkers; Machine learning; Medical computing; mHealth; Physiology; Predictive analytics; 'current; Behavioural measurements; End-users; Health tools; Machine learning models; Modeling performance; Observational study; Opioids; Pressung; User-generated; Wearable sensors","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137014857"

Hence, new AAA monitoring devices that are convenient in use and cost are needed. Our hypothesis is that analysis of arterial waveforms, which could be obtained with such a device, can provide information about AAA size. We aim to initially test this hypothesis via tonometric waveforms. We study noninvasive carotid and femoral blood pressure (BP) waveforms and reference image-based maximal aortic diameter measurements from 50 AAA patients as well as the two noninvasive BP waveforms from these patients after endovascular repair (EVAR) and from 50 comparable control patients. We develop linear regression models for predicting the maximal aortic diameter from waveform or non-waveform features. We evaluate the models in out-of-training data in terms of predicting the maximal aortic diameter value and changes induced by EVAR. The best model includes the carotid area ratio (diastolic area divided by systolic area) and normalized carotid-femoral pulse transit time ((age·diastolic BP)/(height/PTT)) as input features with positive model coefficients. This model is explainable based on the early, negative wave reflection in AAA and the Moens-Korteweg equation for relating PTT to vessel diameter. The predicted maximal aortic diameters yield receiver operating characteristic area under the curves of 0.83 ± 0.04 in classifying AAA versus control patients and 0.72 ± 0.04 in classifying AAA patients before versus after EVAR. These results are significantly better than a baseline model excluding waveform features as input. Our findings could potentially translate to convenient devices that serve as an adjunct to imaging. © 2022, The Author(s).","Blood pressure; Blood vessels; Regression analysis; Abdominal aortic aneurysms; Aortic Diameter; Blood pressure waveform; Endovascular repair; Image-based; Monitoring device; Point of care; Reference image; Waveform features; Waveforms; abdominal aortic aneurysm; adult; aortic diameter; area under the curve; Article; blood pressure; blood pressure monitoring; carotid artery; controlled study; endovascular aneurysm repair; female; human; major clinical study; male; pulse wave; tonometry; waveform; Waveform analysis","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141194983"

Internet- and mobile-based psychological interventions (IMIs) could be a promising addition to close this treatment gap, given their accessibility, anonymity, and scalability. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of IMIs for sexual dysfunctions. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in August 2021 on randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of IMIs on sexual functioning and satisfaction compared to a control condition. Twelve RCTs with 14 comparisons were reviewed with six IMIs targeting female and six IMIs targeting male sexual dysfunctions and n = 952 participants were evaluated in the meta-analysis. IMIs were significantly more effective than control conditions (k = 11 waitlist control group, k = 3 online discussion board) at post-treatment for female sexual functioning (g = 0.59, CI: 0.28–0.90, I2= 0%) and satisfaction (g = 0.90, CI: 0.02–1.79, I2= 82%), and male sexual functioning (g = 0.18, CI: 0.02–0.34, I2= 0%). No significant effect was found for male sexual satisfaction (g = 0.69, CI: −0.13–1.51, I2= 88%) with substantial heterogeneity in studies. Most studies showed high dropout, with ten studies indicating some concern of risk of bias, and two studies showing high risk of bias. The results suggest that IMIs can be an effective treatment for sexual dysfunctions, although additional high-quality research is needed. Given the limited availability of specialized treatment for sexual dysfunctions and individual preferences for discrete treatment options, IMIs seem to be a valuable addition to routine care, empowering individuals to promote their sexual health on a guided self-help basis. © 2022, The Author(s).","Physical therapy; Condition; Control groups; Discussion boards; Literature search; Meta-analysis; Online discussions; Post treatment; Randomized controlled trial; Sexual dysfunction; Systematic Review; adult; cognitive restructuring; controlled study; emotion regulation; erectile dysfunction; female; follow up; human; Internet; interpersonal communication; leisure; male; male sexual dysfunction; meta analysis; mindfulness; premature ejaculation; publication bias; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; self help; sensitivity analysis; sexual dysfunction; sexual education; sexual health; sexual satisfaction; sexuality; systematic review; Ergonomics","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138130040"

While newly developed digital CBT approaches hold important advantages due to higher accessibility, their relative effectiveness compared to traditional CBT remains unclear. We conducted a systematic literature search to identify all studies that conducted a CBT-based intervention (face-to-face or digital) in patients with major depression. Random-effects meta-analytic models of the standardized mean change using raw score standardization (SMCR) were computed. In 106 studies including n = 11854 patients face-to-face CBT shows superior clinical effectiveness compared to digital CBT when investigating depressive symptoms (p < 0.001, face-to-face CBT: SMCR = 1.97, 95%-CI: 1.74–2.13, digital CBT: SMCR = 1.20, 95%-CI: 1.08–1.32) and adherence (p = 0.014, face-to-face CBT: 82.4%, digital CBT: 72.9%). However, after accounting for differences between face-to-face and digital CBT studies, both approaches indicate similar effectiveness. Important variables with significant moderation effects include duration of the intervention, baseline severity, adherence and the level of human guidance in digital CBT interventions. After accounting for potential confounders our analysis indicates comparable effectiveness of face-to-face and digital CBT approaches. These findings underline the importance of moderators of clinical effects and provide a basis for the future personalization of CBT treatment in depression. © 2022, The Author(s).","Patient treatment; antidepressant agent; Analytic modeling; Clinical effectiveness; Cognitive-behavioral therapies; Depressive symptom; Face to face; Human guidance; Literature search; Major depressions; Random effects; Systematic Review; adult; anxiety disorder; clinical effectiveness; cognitive behavioral therapy; comorbidity; comparative effectiveness; confounding variable; depression; disease severity; female; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; human; male; Medline; meta analysis; outcome assessment; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; social psychology; standardization; systematic review; treatment duration; Random processes","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138159864"

Understanding recruitment into RMT research is fundamental for improving historically small sample sizes, reducing loss of statistical power, and ultimately producing results worthy of clinical implementation. There is a need for the standardisation of best practices for successful recruitment into RMT research. The current paper reviews lessons learned from recruitment into the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse- Major Depressive Disorder (RADAR-MDD) study, a large-scale, multi-site prospective cohort study using RMT to explore the clinical course of people with depression across the UK, the Netherlands, and Spain. More specifically, the paper reflects on key experiences from the UK site and consolidates these into four key recruitment strategies, alongside a review of barriers to recruitment. Finally, the strategies and barriers outlined are combined into a model of lessons learned. This work provides a foundation for future RMT study design, recruitment and evaluation. © 2022, The Author(s).","Binary alloys; mHealth; 'current; Best practices; Condition; Health-study; Measurement study; Measurement technologies; Remote measurement; Small Sample Size; Statistical power; Technology research; Article; clinical practice; communication skill; depression assessment; human; major depression; Netherlands; outcome assessment; personal experience; prospective study; relapse; remote assessment of disease and relapse- major depressive disorder; Spain; United Kingdom; Clinical research","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137943093"

To address this gap, we evaluate the effect of smartphone-based gamified team competition intervention on daily step count and sleep duration via a micro-randomized trial on medical interns. Our aim is to assess potential improvements in the factors (namely step count and sleep) that may help interns cope with stress and improve well-being. In 1779 interns, team competition intervention significantly increases the mean daily step count by 105.8 steps (SE 35.8, p = 0.03) relative to the no competition arm, while does not significantly affect the mean daily sleep minutes (p = 0.76). Moderator analyses indicate that the causal effects of competition on daily step count and sleep minutes decreased by 14.5 steps (SE 10.2, p = 0.16) and 1.9 minutes (SE 0.6, p = 0.003) for each additional week-in-study, respectively. Intra-institutional competition negatively moderates the causal effect of competition upon daily step count by −90.3 steps (SE 86.5, p = 0.30). Our results show that gamified team competition delivered via mobile app significantly increases daily physical activity which suggests that team competition can function as a mobile health intervention tool to increase short-term physical activity levels for medical interns. Future improvements in strategies of forming competition opponents and introducing occasional competition breaks may improve the overall effectiveness. © 2023, The Author(s).","Sleep research; Smartphones; Future improvements; Gamification; Health interventions; Mobile app; Moderator analysis; Physical activity; Physical activity levels; Randomized trial; Smart phones; Well being; adult; Article; behavior change; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; competition; controlled study; female; gamification; health behavior; human; human experiment; male; mental health; mood; physical activity; physiological stress; randomized controlled trial; resident; self report; sleep time; step count; wellbeing; mHealth","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146129028"

A nested e-cohort (eFHS) is embedded in the Framingham Heart Study and uses three system components: a new smartphone app, a digital blood pressure (BP) cuff, and a smartwatch. This study aims to identify factors associated with the use of individual eFHS system components over 1-year. Among 1948 eFHS enrollees, we examine participants who returned surveys within 90 days (n = 1918), and those who chose to use the smartwatch (n = 1243) and BP cuff (n = 1115). For each component, we investigate the same set of candidate predictors for usage and use generalized linear mixed models to select predictors (P < 0.1, P value from Z test statistic), adjusting for age, sex, and time (app use: 3-month period, device use: weekly). A multivariable model with the predictors selected from initial testing is used to identify factors associated with use of components (P < 0.05, P value from Z test statistic) adjusting for age, sex, and time. In multivariable models, older age is associated with higher use of all system components. Female sex and higher education levels are associated with higher completion of app-based surveys whereas higher scores for depressive symptoms, and lower than excellent self-rated health are associated with lower use of the smartwatch over the 12-month follow-up. Our findings show that sociodemographic and health related factors are significantly associated with long-term use of digital devices. Future research is needed to test interventional strategies focusing on these factors to evaluate improvement in long-term engagement. © 2022, The Author(s).","Blood pressure; Clinical research; Statistical tests; Statistics; Wearable sensors; Blood pressure cuff; Clinical use; Generalized linear mixed models; Health-study; Multivariable modeling; P-values; Research use; Smartphone apps; System components; Test statistics; adult; age; aged; Article; clinical study; cohort analysis; controlled study; demography; depression; educational status; female; follow up; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; predictor variable; risk factor; sampling; sex difference; tertiary education; Digital devices","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145211051"

However, diagnostic test shortages are prevalent globally and continue to occur in the US with the onset of new COVID-19 variants and emerging diseases like monkeypox, demonstrating an unprecedented need for improving our current methods for mass surveillance testing. By targeting surveillance testing toward individuals who are most likely to be infected and, thus, increasing the testing positivity rate (i.e., percent positive in the surveillance group), fewer tests are needed to capture the same number of positive cases. Here, we developed an Intelligent Testing Allocation (ITA) method by leveraging data from the CovIdentify study (6765 participants) and the MyPHD study (8580 participants), including smartwatch data from 1265 individuals of whom 126 tested positive for COVID-19. Our rigorous model and parameter search uncovered the optimal time periods and aggregate metrics for monitoring continuous digital biomarkers to increase the positivity rate of COVID-19 diagnostic testing. We found that resting heart rate (RHR) features distinguished between COVID-19-positive and -negative cases earlier in the course of the infection than steps features, as early as 10 and 5 days prior to the diagnostic test, respectively. We also found that including steps features increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) by 7–11% when compared with RHR features alone, while including RHR features improved the AUC of the ITA model’s precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) by 38–50% when compared with steps features alone. The best AUC-ROC (0.73 ± 0.14 and 0.77 on the cross-validated training set and independent test set, respectively) and AUC-PR (0.55 ± 0.21 and 0.24) were achieved by using data from a single device type (Fitbit) with high-resolution (minute-level) data. Finally, we show that ITA generates up to a 6.5-fold increase in the positivity rate in the cross-validated training set and up to a 4.5-fold increase in the positivity rate in the independent test set, including both symptomatic and asymptomatic (up to 27%) individuals. Our findings suggest that, if deployed on a large scale and without needing self-reported symptoms, the ITA method could improve the allocation of diagnostic testing resources and reduce the burden of test shortages. © 2022, The Author(s).","Diagnosis; Disease control; Monitoring; Testing; Wearable technology; Allocation methods; Case-studies; Diagnostic testing; Diagnostic tests; Infectious disease; Intelligent testing; Resting heart rate; Test sets; Training sets; Wearable devices; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137435732"

The aim is to evaluate whether smartphone accelerometer data could serve as a proxy for traditional clinical data, either by itself or in combination with typing dynamics. Results show that accelerometer data improves the predictive performance of machine learning models by nearly 5% over those previously reported in the literature based only on clinical data and typing dynamics.

Our literature search included records published between 1st January 2009 and 30th September 2021 from the Scopus, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Global Health and APA PsycInfo databases, and grey literature from a Google Scholar search. We included studies that reported a quantitative and/or qualitative evaluation of a real-world application of AI in an LMIC health context. A total of 10 references evaluating the application of AI in an LMIC were included. Applications varied widely, including: clinical decision support systems, treatment planning and triage assistants and health chatbots. Only half of the papers reported which algorithms and datasets were used in order to train the AI. A number of challenges of using AI tools were reported, including issues with reliability, mixed impacts on workflows, poor user friendliness and lack of adeptness with local contexts. Many barriers exists that prevent the successful development and adoption of well-performing, context-specific AI tools, such as limited data availability, trust and evidence of cost-effectiveness in LMICs. Additional evaluations of the use of AI in healthcare in LMICs are needed in order to identify their effectiveness and reliability in real-world settings and to generate understanding for best practices for future implementations. © 2022, The Author(s).","Cost effectiveness; Decision support systems; Health care; Search engines; AI Technologies; Applications of AI; Global health; Grey literature; Healthcare systems; Literature search; Low income countries; Middle-income countries; Scoping review; Search terms; algorithm; artificial intelligence; clinical decision support system; coronavirus disease 2019; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; diagnosis time; emotional support; health care system; human; low income country; middle income country; reliability; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; self evaluation; thorax radiography; time to treatment; treatment planning; tuberculosis; Artificial intelligence","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140788377"

However, there is a lack of exploration of how biases and methodological decisions impact these tools’ performance in practice. In this paper, we explore the realistic performance of audio-based digital testing of COVID-19. To investigate this, we collected a large crowdsourced respiratory audio dataset through a mobile app, alongside symptoms and COVID-19 test results. Within the collected dataset, we selected 5240 samples from 2478 English-speaking participants and split them into participant-independent sets for model development and validation. In addition to controlling the language, we also balanced demographics for model training to avoid potential acoustic bias. We used these audio samples to construct an audio-based COVID-19 prediction model. The unbiased model took features extracted from breathing, coughs and voice signals as predictors and yielded an AUC-ROC of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65–0.77). We further explored several scenarios with different types of unbalanced data distributions to demonstrate how biases and participant splits affect the performance. With these different, but less appropriate, evaluation strategies, the performance could be overestimated, reaching an AUC up to 0.90 (95% CI: 0.85–0.95) in some circumstances. We found that an unrealistic experimental setting can result in misleading, sometimes over-optimistic, performance. Instead, we reported complete and reliable results on crowd-sourced data, which would allow medical professionals and policy makers to accurately assess the value of this technology and facilitate its deployment. © 2022, Crown.","Audio acoustics; Crowdsourcing; Large dataset; Statistical tests; AND splits; Audio-based; Coronaviruses; Decision impacts; Digital testing; Independent set; Mobile app; Model development; Performance; Tool performance; abnormal respiratory sound; acoustics; adult; Article; audio recording; breathing; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; COVID-19 testing; deep learning; demographics; English (language); feature extraction; female; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mobile application; task performance; validation study; voice; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124006340"

Emergency departments (EDs) are tasked with distinguishing patients who require hospital resources from those who may be safely discharged to the community. The novelty and high variability of COVID-19 have made these determinations challenging. In this study, we developed, implemented and evaluated an electronic health record (EHR) embedded clinical decision support (CDS) system that leverages machine learning (ML) to estimate short-term risk for clinical deterioration in patients with or under investigation for COVID-19. The system translates model-generated risk for critical care needs within 24 h and inpatient care needs within 72 h into rapidly interpretable COVID-19 Deterioration Risk Levels made viewable within ED clinician workflow. ML models were derived in a retrospective cohort of 21,452 ED patients who visited one of five ED study sites and were prospectively validated in 15,670 ED visits that occurred before (n = 4322) or after (n = 11,348) CDS implementation; model performance and numerous patient-oriented outcomes including in-hospital mortality were measured across study periods. Incidence of critical care needs within 24 h and inpatient care needs within 72 h were 10.7% and 22.5%, respectively and were similar across study periods. ML model performance was excellent under all conditions, with AUC ranging from 0.85 to 0.91 for prediction of critical care needs and 0.80–0.90 for inpatient care needs. Total mortality was unchanged across study periods but was reduced among high-risk patients after CDS implementation. © 2022, The Author(s).","Decision support systems; Deterioration; Health risks; Hospitals; Machine learning; Risk perception; Clinical decision support; Critical care; Emergency departments; Hospital admissions; Integrated machines; Machine learning models; Machine learning systems; Modeling performance; Multi-site; Work-flows; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; clinical decision support system; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; electronic health record; emergency ward; female; health care delivery; high risk patient; hospital admission; hospital patient; human; in-hospital mortality; intensive care; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; prediction; retrospective study; risk assessment; young adult; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134402607"

We predicted COVID-19 mortality using baseline commonly measured laboratory values and standard demographic and clinical covariates across healthcare systems, countries, and continents. Specifically, we trained a Cox regression model with nine measured laboratory test values, standard demographics at admission, and comorbidity burden pre-admission. These models were compared at site, country, and continent level. Of the 39,969 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (68.6% male), 5717 (14.3%) died. In the Cox model, age, albumin, AST, creatine, CRP, and white blood cell count are most predictive of mortality. The baseline covariates are more predictive of mortality during the early days of COVID-19 hospitalization. Models trained at healthcare systems with larger cohort size largely retain good transportability performance when porting to different sites. The combination of routine laboratory test values at admission along with basic demographic features can predict mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Importantly, this potentially deployable model differs from prior work by demonstrating not only consistent performance but also reliable transportability across healthcare systems in the US and Europe, highlighting the generalizability of this model and the overall approach. © 2022, The Author(s).","Blood; Forecasting; Health care; Laboratories; Population statistics; Regression analysis; alanine aminotransferase; albumin; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; C reactive protein; creatine; creatinine; Comorbidities; Covariates; Cox model; Cox's regression model; Healthcare systems; International comparison; Laboratory test; Multi-nationals; Prediction algorithms; White blood cells; algorithm; Article; blood cell count; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; clinical laboratory; clinical trial; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; demographics; disease burden; health care system; hospital admission; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; in-hospital mortality; laboratory test; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; mortality rate; mortality risk; neutrophil count; pandemic; population dynamics; predictive model; predictive value; proportional hazards model; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131887608"

They also lead to inefficient use of medical resources in hospitals and clinics. The ability to predict a likely no-show in advance could enable the design and implementation of interventions to reduce the risk of it happening, thus improving patients’ care and clinical resource allocation. In this study, we develop a new interpretable deep learning-based approach for predicting the risk of no-shows at the time when a medical appointment is first scheduled. The retrospective study was conducted in an academic pediatric teaching hospital with a 20% no-show rate. Our approach tackles several challenges in the design of a predictive model by (1) adopting a data imputation method for patients with missing information in their records (77% of the population), (2) exploiting local weather information to improve predictive accuracy, and (3) developing an interpretable approach that explains how a prediction is made for each individual patient. Our proposed neural network-based and logistic regression-based methods outperformed persistence baselines. In an unobserved set of patients, our method correctly identified 83% of no-shows at the time of scheduling and led to a false alert rate less than 17%. Our method is capable of producing meaningful predictions even when some information in a patient’s records is missing. We find that patients’ past no-show record is the strongest predictor. Finally, we discuss several potential interventions to reduce no-shows, such as scheduling appointments of high-risk patients at off-peak times, which can serve as starting point for further studies on no-show interventions. © 2022, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Forecasting; Hospitals; Learning systems; Patient treatment; Population statistics; Scheduling; Clinical resources; Data imputation methods; Design and implementations; Learning-based approach; Machine learning approaches; Missing information; Patient care; Patient health; Predictive models; Resources allocation; article; child; deep learning; female; high risk patient; human; machine learning; male; prediction; predictive model; retrospective study; risk assessment; teaching hospital; weather; Pediatrics","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128449505"

Without careful and deliberate bias mitigation, inequities embedded in data can be transferred to model predictions, perpetuating disparities, and exacerbating the disproportionate harms of the COVID-19 pandemic. These biases in data and forecasts can be viewed through both statistical and sociological lenses, and the challenges of both building hierarchical models with limited data availability and drawing on data that reflects structural inequities must be confronted.

Here, we report a deep learning model trained on an individual’s body shape outline—or “silhouette” —that enables accurate estimation of specific fat depots of interest, including visceral (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous (ASAT), and gluteofemoral (GFAT) adipose tissue volumes, and VAT/ASAT ratio. Two-dimensional coronal and sagittal silhouettes are constructed from whole-body magnetic resonance images in 40,032 participants of the UK Biobank and used as inputs for a convolutional neural network to predict each of these quantities. Mean age of the study participants is 65 years and 51% are female. A cross-validated deep learning model trained on silhouettes enables accurate estimation of VAT, ASAT, and GFAT volumes (R2: 0.88, 0.93, and 0.93, respectively), outperforming a comparator model combining anthropometric and bioimpedance measures (ΔR2 = 0.05–0.13). Next, we study VAT/ASAT ratio, a nearly body-mass index (BMI)—and waist circumference-independent marker of metabolically unhealthy fat distribution. While the comparator model poorly predicts VAT/ASAT ratio (R2: 0.17–0.26), a silhouette-based model enables significant improvement (R2: 0.50–0.55). Increased silhouette-predicted VAT/ASAT ratio is associated with increased risk of prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease independent of BMI and waist circumference. These results demonstrate that body silhouette images can estimate important measures of fat distribution, laying the scientific foundation for scalable population-based assessment. © 2022, The Author(s).","Comparator circuits; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diseases; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Risk perception; Accurate estimation; Adipose tissue; Body fats; Body mass; Body shapes; Clinical practices; Fat depot; Learning models; Mass index; Silhouette images; adipose tissue; adult; aged; anthropometry; Article; biobank; body build; body fat distribution; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; convolutional neural network; cross validation; deep learning; female; human; image quality; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; predictive value; United Kingdom; waist circumference; whole body MRI; Comparators (optical)","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134879544"

Some barriers to communicating health promotion to people of certain cultural groups might be overcome via the internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMI). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the effectiveness of culturally adapted IMI for health promotion interventions among culturally diverse populations. We systematically searched on Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EbscoHost/MEDLINE, Ovid/Embase, EbscoHost/PsychINFO, and Web of Science databases in October 2020. Out of 9438 records, 13 randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating culturally adapted health promotion IMI addressing healthy eating, physical activity, alcohol consumption, sexual health behavior, and smoking cessation included. From the included studies 10,747 participants were eligible. Culturally adapted IMI proved to be non-superior over active control conditions in short- (g = 0.10, [95% CI −0.19 to 0.40]) and long-term (g = 0.20, [95% CI −0.11 to 0.51]) in promoting health behavior. However, culturally adapted IMI for physical activity (k = 3, N = 296) compared to active controls yielded a beneficial effect in long-term (g = 0.48, [95%CI 0.25 to 0.71]). Adapting health promotion IMI to the cultural context of different cultural populations seems not yet to be recommendable given the substantial adaption efforts necessary and the mostly non-significant findings. However, these findings need to be seen as preliminary given the limited number of included trials with varying methodological rigor and the partly substantial between-trial heterogeneity pointing in the direction of potentially useful culturally adapted IMI which now need to be disentangled from the less promising approaches.

Close contacts who were predicted by the data-driven models were tested much more quickly on average (0.94 days from reported exposure; 95% CI 0.78–1.11) than those who were manually contact traced (1.92 days; 95% CI 1.81–2.02). We further discuss how other universities, business, and organizations could adopt similar strategies to help quickly identify positive cases and reduce community transmission. © 2022, The Author(s).","Coronavirus; Software testing; Testing; Transmissions; Data driven; Data-driven model; General Surveillance; Global threats; Machine learning models; Simple++; Student testing; Testing programmes; Article; cohort analysis; community transmission; contact examination; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 testing; disease surveillance; follow up; human; immunofluorescence assay; machine learning; network analysis; positivity rate; predictive model; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124899958"

To be useful, the remotely-collected measurements should be valid, reliable, and sensitive to change, and people with PD must engage with the technology. We developed a smartwatch-based active assessment that enables unsupervised measurement of motor signs of PD. Participants with early-stage PD (N = 388, 64% men, average age 63) wore a smartwatch for a median of 390 days. Participants performed unsupervised motor tasks both in-clinic (once) and remotely (twice weekly for one year). Dropout rate was 5.4%. Median wear-time was 21.1 h/day, and 59% of per-protocol remote assessments were completed. Analytical validation was established for in-clinic measurements, which showed moderate-to-strong correlations with consensus MDS-UPDRS Part III ratings for rest tremor (⍴ = 0.70), bradykinesia (⍴ = −0.62), and gait (⍴ = −0.46). Test-retest reliability of remote measurements, aggregated monthly, was good-to-excellent (ICC = 0.75–0.96). Remote measurements were sensitive to the known effects of dopaminergic medication (on vs off Cohen’s d = 0.19–0.54). Of note, in-clinic assessments often did not reflect the patients’ typical status at home. This demonstrates the feasibility of smartwatch-based unsupervised active tests, and establishes the analytical validity of associated digital measurements. Weekly measurements provide a real-life distribution of disease severity, as it fluctuates longitudinally. Sensitivity to medication-induced change and improved reliability imply that these methods could help reduce sample sizes needed to demonstrate a response to therapeutic interventions or disease progression. © 2022, The Author(s).","Patient monitoring; Wearable computers; Average ages; Disease progression; Measurements of; Motor function; Motor tasks; Patient response; Remote measurement; Remote monitoring; Therapeutic intervention; Wear time; adult; Article; bradykinesia; consensus; controlled study; feasibility study; female; gait; Hoehn and Yahr scale; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; MDS-Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; middle aged; Montreal cognitive assessment; motor performance; Parkinson disease; prospective study; remote sensing; test retest reliability; tremor; validity; Patient treatment","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130721603"

This double-blinded, multi-site, prospective, active comparator cohort study tested the accuracy of an artificial intelligence-based Software as a Medical Device designed to aid primary care healthcare providers (HCPs) in diagnosing ASD. The Device combines behavioral features from three distinct inputs (a caregiver questionnaire, analysis of two short home videos, and an HCP questionnaire) in a gradient boosted decision tree machine learning algorithm to produce either an ASD positive, ASD negative, or indeterminate output. This study compared Device outputs to diagnostic agreement by two or more independent specialists in a cohort of 18–72-month-olds with developmental delay concerns (425 study completers, 36% female, 29% ASD prevalence). Device output PPV for all study completers was 80.8% (95% confidence intervals (CI), 70.3%–88.8%) and NPV was 98.3% (90.6%–100%). For the 31.8% of participants who received a determinate output (ASD positive or negative) Device sensitivity was 98.4% (91.6%–100%) and specificity was 78.9% (67.6%–87.7%). The Device’s indeterminate output acts as a risk control measure when inputs are insufficiently granular to make a determinate recommendation with confidence. If this risk control measure were removed, the sensitivity for all study completers would fall to 51.6% (63/122) (95% CI 42.4%, 60.8%), and specificity would fall to 18.5% (56/303) (95% CI 14.3%, 23.3%). Among participants for whom the Device abstained from providing a result, specialists identified that 91% had one or more complex neurodevelopmental disorders. No significant differences in Device performance were found across participants’ sex, race/ethnicity, income, or education level. For nearly a third of this primary care sample, the Device enabled timely diagnostic evaluation with a high degree of accuracy. The Device shows promise to significantly increase the number of children able to be diagnosed with ASD in a primary care setting, potentially facilitating earlier intervention and more efficient use of specialist resources. © 2022, The Author(s).","Decision trees; Diagnosis; Diseases; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Software testing; Surveys; Autism spectrum disorders; Cohort studies; Confidence interval; Control measures; Health care providers; Medical Devices; Multi-site; Primary care; Prospectives; Risks controls; anxiety disorder; Article; artificial intelligence; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism; caregiver; child; cohort analysis; communication disorder; compulsion; controlled study; developmental delay; developmental disorder; diagnostic accuracy; double blind procedure; education; ethnicity; evaluation study; female; gender; health care personnel; human; income; intellectual impairment; language disability; learning disorder; major clinical study; male; medical specialist; motor dysfunction; multicenter study; oppositional defiant disorder; preschool child; prevalence; primary medical care; prospective study; questionnaire; race; sensitivity and specificity; speech sound disorder; videorecording; Risk assessment","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129593842"

Failure to do so can lead to adverse glycemic events with short and long-term complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is widely used in T1D self-management for real-time glucose measurements, while smartphone apps are adopted as basic electronic diaries, data visualization tools, and simple decision support tools for insulin dosing. Applying a mixed effects logistic regression analysis to the outcomes of a six-week longitudinal study in 12 T1D adults using CGM and a clinically validated wearable sensor wristband (NCT ID: NCT03643692), we identified several significant associations between physiological measurements and hypo- and hyperglycemic events measured an hour later. We proceeded to develop a new smartphone-based platform, ARISES (Adaptive, Real-time, and Intelligent System to Enhance Self-care), with an embedded deep learning algorithm utilizing multi-modal data from CGM, daily entries of meal and bolus insulin, and the sensor wristband to predict glucose levels and hypo- and hyperglycemia. For a 60-minute prediction horizon, the proposed algorithm achieved the average root mean square error (RMSE) of 35.28 ± 5.77 mg/dL with the Matthews correlation coefficients for detecting hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia of 0.56 ± 0.07 and 0.70 ± 0.05, respectively. The use of wristband data significantly reduced the RMSE by 2.25 mg/dL (p < 0.01). The well-trained model is implemented on the ARISES app to provide real-time decision support.

However, these highly complex systems are sensitive to changes in the environment and liable to performance decay. Even after their successful integration into clinical practice, ML/AI algorithms should be continuously monitored and updated to ensure their long-term safety and effectiveness. To bring AI into maturity in clinical care, we advocate for the creation of hospital units responsible for quality assurance and improvement of these algorithms, which we refer to as “AI-QI” units. We discuss how tools that have long been used in hospital quality assurance and quality improvement can be adapted to monitor static ML algorithms. On the other hand, procedures for continual model updating are still nascent.

We compared nine DL frameworks using simulated body mass index (BMI), glucose, and systolic blood pressure trajectories, independently isolated shape and magnitude changes, and evaluated model performance across various parameters (e.g., irregularity, missingness). Overall, discrimination based on variation in shape was more challenging than magnitude. Time-series forest-convolutional neural networks (TSF-CNN) and Gramian angular field(GAF)-CNN outperformed other approaches (P < 0.05) with overall area-under-the-curve (AUCs) of 0.93 for both models, and 0.92 and 0.89 for variation in magnitude and shape with up to 50% missing data. Furthermore, in a real-world assessment, the TSF-CNN model predicted T2D with AUCs reaching 0.72 using only BMI trajectories.

Ages were estimated with a mean absolute error of 5.8 ± 1.6 years, while basic sleep scoring measures had an error of 14.9 ± 6.29 years. After controlling for demographics, sleep, and health covariates, each 10-year increment in age estimate error (AEE) was associated with increased all-cause mortality rate of 29% (95% confidence interval: 20–39%). An increase from −10 to +10 years in AEE translates to an estimated decreased life expectancy of 8.7 years (95% confidence interval: 6.1–11.4 years).

With suicide-related mortality rates rising in recent years, it is becoming increasingly urgent to understand, predict, and prevent suicidal behavior. Here, we compare the predictive value of structured and unstructured EHR data for predicting suicide risk. We find that Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Random Forest (RF) models trained on structured EHR data perform better than those based on unstructured EHR data. An NBC model trained on both structured and unstructured data yields similar performance (AUC = 0.743) to an NBC model trained on structured data alone (0.742, p = 0.668), while an RF model trained on both data types yields significantly better results (AUC = 0.903) than an RF model trained on structured data alone (0.887, p < 0.001), likely due to the RF model’s ability to capture interactions between the two data types. To investigate these interactions, we propose and implement a general framework for identifying specific structured-unstructured feature pairs whose interactions differ between case and non-case cohorts, and thus have the potential to improve predictive performance and increase understanding of clinical risk. We find that such feature pairs tend to capture heterogeneous pairs of general concepts, rather than homogeneous pairs of specific concepts. These findings and this framework can be used to improve current and future EHR-based clinical modeling efforts. © 2022, The Author(s).","Barium compounds; Classifiers; Forecasting; Health risks; opiate; Case-studies; Classifier models; Clinical risks; Datatypes; Electronic health; Health records; Naive Bayes classifiers; Random forest modeling; Structured data; Unstructured interactions; Article; Bayesian learning; bipolar disorder; case study; classifier; electronic health record; human; impulse control disorder; major clinical study; opiate addiction; predictive value; random forest; risk assessment; schizoaffective psychosis; suicidal ideation; suicide; Decision trees","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123994227"

DeTAP (Decentralized Trial in Afib Patients, NCT04471623) was a 6-month, single-arm, 100% virtual study of 100 AF patients on OAC aged >55 years, recruited traditionally and through social media. Participants enrolled and participated virtually using a mobile application and remote blood pressure (BP) and six-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors. Four engagement-based primary endpoints included changes in pre- versus end-of-study OAC adherence (OACA), and % completion of televisits, surveys, and ECG and BP measurements. Secondary endpoints included survey-based nuisance bleeding and patient feedback. 100 subjects (mean age 70 years, 44% women, 90% White) were recruited in 28 days (traditional: 6 pts; social media: 94 pts in 12 days with >300 waitlisted). Study engagement was high: 91% televisits, 85% surveys, and 99% ECG and 99% BP measurement completion. OACA was unchanged at 6 months (baseline: 97 ± 9%, 6 months: 96 ± 15%, p = 0.39). In patients with low baseline OACA (<90%), there was significant 6-month improvement (85 ± 16% to 96 ± 6%, p < 0.01). 86% of respondents (69/80) expressed willingness to continue in a longer trial. The DeTAP study demonstrated rapid recruitment, high engagement, and physiologic reporting via the integration of digital technologies and dedicated study coordination.

Personalized computational models are also assisting in applications ranging from drug development to treatment optimization. More advanced medical digital twins will be essential to making precision medicine a reality. Because the immune system plays an important role in such a wide range of diseases and health conditions, from fighting pathogens to autoimmune disorders, digital twins of the immune system will have an especially high impact. However, their development presents major challenges, stemming from the inherent complexity of the immune system and the difficulty of measuring many aspects of a patient’s immune state in vivo. This perspective outlines a roadmap for meeting these challenges and building a prototype of an immune digital twin. It is structured as a four-stage process that proceeds from a specification of a concrete use case to model constructions, personalization, and continued improvement. © 2022, The Author(s).","Immune system; Autoimmune disorder; Computational modelling; Drug development; Health condition; Human immune systems; Insulin pumps; Pump control; Roadmap; Simulation model; Treatment optimization; computer model; digital twin; government; human; immune system; information system; nonhuman; Review; software; validation process; Diagnosis","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130503166"

However, reported accuracies vary widely among endoscopists. We developed a novel intelligent medical device able to seamlessly operate in real-time using conventional white light (WL) endoscopy video stream without virtual chromoendoscopy (blue light, BL). In this work, we evaluated the standalone performance of this computer-aided diagnosis device (CADx) on a prospectively acquired dataset of unaltered colonoscopy videos. An international group of endoscopists performed optical characterization of each polyp acquired in a prospective study, blinded to both histology and CADx result, by means of an online platform enabling careful video assessment. Colorectal polyps were categorized by reviewers, subdivided into 10 experts and 11 non-experts endoscopists, and by the CADx as either “adenoma” or “non-adenoma”. A total of 513 polyps from 165 patients were assessed. CADx accuracy in WL was found comparable to the accuracy of expert endoscopists (CADxWL/Exp; OR 1.211 [0.766–1.915]) using histopathology as the reference standard. Moreover, CADx accuracy in WL was found superior to the accuracy of non-expert endoscopists (CADxWL/NonExp; OR 1.875 [1.191–2.953]), and CADx accuracy in BL was found comparable to it (CADxBL/CADxWL; OR 0.886 [0.612–1.282]).

However, the availability of medical specialists to annotate digitized images and free-text diagnostic reports does not scale with the need for large datasets required to train robust computer-aided diagnosis methods that can target the high variability of clinical cases and data produced. This work proposes and evaluates an approach to eliminate the need for manual annotations to train computer-aided diagnosis tools in digital pathology. The approach includes two components, to automatically extract semantically meaningful concepts from diagnostic reports and use them as weak labels to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for histopathology diagnosis. The approach is trained (through 10-fold cross-validation) on 3’769 clinical images and reports, provided by two hospitals and tested on over 11’000 images from private and publicly available datasets.

However, the use of these tools in large, complex health systems remains comparatively limited. The adoption and implementation of digital health tools at an enterprise level is a challenge; few strategies exist to help tools cross the chasm from clinical validation to integration within the workflows of a large health system. Many previously proposed frameworks for digital health implementation are difficult to operationalize in these dynamic organizations. In this piece, we put forth nine dimensions along which clinically validated digital health tools should be examined by health systems prior to adoption, and propose strategies for selecting digital health tools and planning for implementation in this setting. By evaluating prospective tools along these dimensions, health systems can evaluate which existing digital health solutions are worthy of adoption, ensure they have sufficient resources for deployment and long-term use, and devise a strategic plan for implementation. © 2022, The Author(s).","Clinical validations; Dynamic organization; Health planning; Health systems; Health tools; Healthcare services; Prospectives; Strategic plan; Work-flows; adoption; health care delivery; human; review; workflow","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123872810"

The urgent need for effective and affordable COVID-19 treatments calls for repurposing combinations of approved drugs. The challenge is to identify which combinations are likely to be most effective and at what stages of the disease. Here, we present the first disease-stage executable signalling network model of SARS-CoV-2-host interactions used to predict effective repurposed drug combinations for treating early- and late stage severe disease. Using our executable model, we performed in silico screening of 9870 pairs of 140 potential targets and have identified nine new drug combinations. Camostat and Apilimod were predicted to be the most promising combination in effectively supressing viral replication in the early stages of severe disease and were validated experimentally in human Caco-2 cells. Our study further demonstrates the power of executable mechanistic modelling to enable rapid pre-clinical evaluation of combination therapies tailored to disease progression. It also presents a novel resource and expandable model system that can respond to further needs in the pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s).","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Disease control; Drug interactions; 4 phenylbutyric acid; acetylcysteine; aliskiren; alpha2a interferon; angiotensin receptor antagonist; anifrolumab; anticoronavirus agent; apilimod; baricitinib; basiliximab; belnacasan; camostat; canakinumab; carlumab; cetuximab; chloroquine; colchicine; copanlisib; dexamethasone; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; disulfiram; emricasan; fedratinib; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; gamma1b interferon; homoharringtonine; infliximab; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; lopinavir; losmapimod; miltefosine; nivocasan; paxlovid; pf 07321332; recombinant interleukin 10; remdesivir; ritonavir; ruxolitinib; sar 113945; sirolimus; tetrandrine; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; ulixertinib; umifenovir; unclassified drug; Breaking point; Combination treatments; Drug combinations; Executables; Healthcare systems; Hosts interactions; Late stage; Network models; Repurposing; Signaling networks; antiinflammatory activity; antiviral activity; antiviral therapy; Article; Caco-2 cell line; combination drug therapy; computer model; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; drug repositioning; drug targeting; endoplasmic reticulum stress; human; human cell; lung alveolus cell; lung epithelium; monotherapy; nonhuman; prediction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus cell interaction; virus entry; virus replication; Diagnosis","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124947165"

A growing challenge for the health care system is therefore to facilitate the identification of safe and effective apps for health care practitioners and patients to generate the most health benefit as well as guide payer coverage decisions. Nearly all developed countries are attempting to define policy frameworks to improve decision-making, patient care, and health outcomes in this context. This study compares the national policy approaches currently in development/use for health apps in nine countries. We used secondary data, combined with a detailed review of policy and regulatory documents, and interviews with key individuals and experts in the field of digital health policy to collect data about implemented and planned policies and initiatives. We found that most approaches aim for centralized pipelines for health app approvals, although some countries are adding decentralized elements. While the countries studied are taking diverse paths, there is nevertheless broad, international convergence in terms of requirements in the areas of transparency, health content, interoperability, and privacy and security. The sheer number of apps on the market in most countries represents a challenge for clinicians and patients. Our analyses of the relevant policies identified challenges in areas such as reimbursement, safety, and privacy and suggest that more regulatory work is needed in the areas of operationalization, implementation and international transferability of approvals. Cross-national efforts are needed around regulation and for countries to realize the benefits of these technologies. © 2022, The Author(s).","Decision making; Decisions makings; Developed countries; Health benefits; Health guides; Health outcomes; Healthcare systems; International comparison; Patient care; Patient health; Policy framework; adult; article; health care policy; human; interview; pipeline; privacy; reimbursement; security; Health care","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126735096"

We assessed the validity of C3PO by deploying established risk models for myocardial infarction/stroke and atrial fibrillation. We then compared C3PO to Convenience Samples including all individuals from the same EHR with complete data, but without a longitudinal primary care requirement. NLP reduced the missingness of vital signs by 31%. NLP-recovered vital signs were highly correlated with values derived from structured fields (Pearson r range 0.95–0.99). Atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction/stroke incidence were lower and risk models were better calibrated in C3PO as opposed to the Convenience Samples (calibration error range for myocardial infarction/stroke: 0.012–0.030 in C3PO vs. 0.028–0.046 in Convenience Samples; calibration error for atrial fibrillation 0.028 in C3PO vs. 0.036 in Convenience Samples).

Objective measures of disease severity would be powerful tools for evaluating real-world drug effectiveness, efficacy in clinical trials, and for identifying participants for cohort studies. We developed a machine learning (ML) based objective measure for ALS disease severity based on voice samples and accelerometer measurements from a four-year longitudinal dataset. 584 people living with ALS consented and carried out prescribed speaking and limb-based tasks. 542 participants contributed 5814 voice recordings, and 350 contributed 13,009 accelerometer samples, while simultaneously measuring ALSFRS-R scores. Using these data, we trained ML models to predict bulbar-related and limb-related ALSFRS-R scores. On the test set (n = 109 participants) the voice models achieved a multiclass AUC of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.85–0.88) on speech ALSFRS-R prediction, whereas the accelerometer models achieved a median multiclass AUC of 0.73 on 6 limb-related functions. The correlations across functions observed in self-reported ALSFRS-R scores were preserved in ML-derived scores. We used these models and self-reported ALSFRS-R scores to evaluate the real-world effects of edaravone, a drug approved for use in ALS. In the cohort of 54 test participants who received edaravone as part of their usual care, the ML-derived scores were consistent with the self-reported ALSFRS-R scores. At the individual level, the continuous ML-derived score can capture gradual changes that are absent in the integer ALSFRS-R scores. This demonstrates the value of these tools for assessing disease severity and, potentially, drug effects. © 2022, The Author(s).","Function evaluation; Machine learning; Neurodegenerative diseases; Surveys; norphenazone; Accelerometer measurement; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Clinical trial; Cohort studies; Disease severity; Edaravone; Machine-learning; Objective measure; Rating scale; Real-world; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; area under the curve; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease severity; drug efficacy; human; longitudinal study; machine learning; major clinical study; prediction; self report; speech; task performance; voice analysis; Accelerometers","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128106998"

Determining a patient’s optimal therapy is a challenge, where oncologists must select a therapy with the highest likelihood of success and the lowest likelihood of toxicity. International standards for prognostication rely on non-specific and semi-quantitative tools, commonly leading to over- and under-treatment. Tissue-based molecular biomarkers have attempted to address this, but most have limited validation in prospective randomized trials and expensive processing costs, posing substantial barriers to widespread adoption. There remains a significant need for accurate and scalable tools to support therapy personalization. Here we demonstrate prostate cancer therapy personalization by predicting long-term, clinically relevant outcomes using a multimodal deep learning architecture and train models using clinical data and digital histopathology from prostate biopsies. We train and validate models using five phase III randomized trials conducted across hundreds of clinical centers. Histopathological data was available for 5654 of 7764 randomized patients (71%) with a median follow-up of 11.4 years. Compared to the most common risk-stratification tool—risk groups developed by the National Cancer Center Network (NCCN)—our models have superior discriminatory performance across all endpoints, ranging from 9.2% to 14.6% relative improvement in a held-out validation set. This artificial intelligence-based tool improves prognostication over standard tools and allows oncologists to computationally predict the likeliest outcomes of specific patients to determine optimal treatment. Outfitted with digital scanners and internet access, any clinic could offer such capabilities, enabling global access to therapy personalization. © 2022, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Oncology; Urology; Cancer therapy; Clinical trial; International standards; Molecular biomarker; Multi-modal; Personalizations; Processing costs; Prospective randomized trial; Prostate cancers; Quantitative tool; adult; African American; androgen deprivation therapy; Article; Asian; biochemical recurrence; cancer therapy; Caucasian; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; deep learning; distant metastasis; external beam radiotherapy; follow up; Gleason score; Hispanic; histopathology; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; multilayer perceptron; oncologist; personalized medicine; phase 3 clinical trial; prospective study; prostate biopsy; prostate cancer; randomized controlled trial; Diseases","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134004361"

We aim to define the term digital surgery and the ethical issues surrounding its clinical application, and to identify barriers and research goals for future practice. 38 international experts, across the fields of surgery, AI, industry, law, ethics and policy, participated in a four-round Delphi exercise. Issues were generated by an expert panel and public panel through a scoping questionnaire around key themes identified from the literature and voted upon in two subsequent questionnaire rounds. Consensus was defined if >70% of the panel deemed the statement important and <30% unimportant. A final online meeting was held to discuss consensus statements. The definition of digital surgery as the use of technology for the enhancement of preoperative planning, surgical performance, therapeutic support, or training, to improve outcomes and reduce harm achieved 100% consensus agreement. We highlight key ethical issues concerning data, privacy, confidentiality and public trust, consent, law, litigation and liability, and commercial partnerships within digital surgery and identify barriers and research goals for future practice.

Current protocols assess PD symptoms during clinic visits and can be subjective. Patient diaries can help clinicians evaluate at-home symptoms, but can be incomplete or inaccurate. Therefore, researchers have developed in-home automated methods to monitor PD symptoms to enable data-driven PD diagnosis and management. We queried the US National Library of Medicine PubMed database to analyze the progression of the technologies and computational/machine learning methods used to monitor common motor PD symptoms. A sub-set of roughly 12,000 papers was reviewed that best characterized the machine learning and technology timelines that manifested from reviewing the literature. The technology used to monitor PD motor symptoms has advanced significantly in the past five decades. Early monitoring began with in-lab devices such as needle-based EMG, transitioned to in-lab accelerometers/gyroscopes, then to wearable accelerometers/gyroscopes, and finally to phone and mobile & web application-based in-home monitoring. Significant progress has also been made with respect to the use of machine learning algorithms to classify PD patients. Using data from different devices (e.g., video cameras, phone-based accelerometers), researchers have designed neural network and non-neural network-based machine learning algorithms to categorize PD patients across tremor, gait, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia. The five-decade co-evolution of technology and computational techniques used to monitor PD motor symptoms has driven significant progress that is enabling the shift from in-lab/clinic to in-home monitoring of PD symptoms. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Cellular telephones; Diagnosis; E-learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; mHealth; Neurodegenerative diseases; Video cameras; Co-evolution; Digital technologies; Disease symptoms; Gait abnormalities; Home monitoring; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning technology; Motor impairments; Neural-networks; Neurodegenerative disorders; bradykinesia; coevolution; controlled study; digital technology; dyskinesia; electromyography; gait; gait disorder; home monitoring; human; Medline; mobile application; Parkinson disease; patient monitoring; Review; supervised machine learning; systematic review; tremor; Accelerometers","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126779509"

Algorithm predictive ability was tested separately on 144 procedures by scoring the performance of neurosurgical trainees who are at different training stages. The ICEMS successfully differentiated between neurosurgeons, senior trainees, junior trainees, and students. Trainee average performance score correlated with the year of training in neurosurgery.

It is challenging to demonstrate the contribution of digital health investment in achieving the healthcare aims of population health and workforce sustainability. We conducted a scoping review to understand how electronic medical record (EMR) implementations in the hospital setting have been evaluated using cost–benefit analysis (CBA) approaches. The review search resulted in 1184 unique articles, a final list of 28 was collated of which 20 were US-based studies. All studies were published in 2010–2019, with fewer studies published in more recent years. The data used to estimate benefits and costs were dated from 1996 to 2016, with most data from 2000 to 2010. Only three studies were qualified as using cost–benefit analysis approaches. While studies indicated that there is a positive impact from the EMR implementation, the impacts measured varied greatly. We concluded that the current literature demonstrates a lack of appropriate and comprehensive economic frameworks to understand the value of digital hospital implementations. Additionally, most studies failed to align fully to the quadruple aims of healthcare: they focused either on cost savings and/or improved patient outcomes and population health, none investigated healthcare-workforce sustainability. © 2022, The Author(s).","Economic analysis; Health care; Hospitals; Medical computing; Personnel; Sustainable development; Analysis approach; Cost-benefits analysis; Digital transformation; Economics analysis; Economics evaluations; Evaluation and analysis; Medical record; Population health; Scoping review; Workforce sustainability; cost benefit analysis; cost control; economic evaluation; electronic medical record; health workforce; human; outcome assessment; population health; review; Cost benefit analysis","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126211367"

A robust method to incorporate “live” updates of progression risk during follow-up has hitherto been lacking. To address this, we developed a deep learning-based individualised longitudinal survival model using Dynamic-DeepHit-Lite (DDHL) that learns data-driven distribution of time-to-event outcomes. Further refining outputs, we used a reinforcement learning approach (Actor-Critic) for temporal predictive clustering (AC-TPC) to discover groups with similar time-to-event outcomes to support clinical utility. We applied these methods to data from 585 men on AS with longitudinal and comprehensive follow-up (median 4.4 years). Time-dependent C-indices and Brier scores were calculated and compared to Cox regression and landmarking methods. Both Cox and DDHL models including only baseline variables showed comparable C-indices but the DDHL model performance improved with additional follow-up data. With 3 years of data collection and 3 years follow-up the DDHL model had a C-index of 0.79 (±0.11) compared to 0.70 (±0.15) for landmarking Cox and 0.67 (±0.09) for baseline Cox only. Model calibration was good across all models tested. The AC-TPC method further discovered 4 distinct outcome-related temporal clusters with distinct progression trajectories. Those in the lowest risk cluster had negligible progression risk while those in the highest cluster had a 50% risk of progression by 5 years. In summary, we report a novel machine learning approach to inform personalised follow-up during active surveillance which improves predictive power with increasing data input over time. © 2022, The Author(s).","Diseases; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Monitoring; Reinforcement learning; Urology; Actor critic; Dynamic estimation; Early disease; Follow up; Landmarking; Machine learning algorithms; Management options; Prostate cancers; Robust methods; Time to events; active surveillance; aged; Article; calibration; cancer growth; cancer survival; cohort analysis; controlled study; deep learning; dynamic deephit lite; follow up; human; human tissue; learning algorithm; longitudinal study; machine learning; major clinical study; male; predictive model; prostate cancer; reinforcement learning (machine learning); Deep learning","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135475318"

Most healthbots are patient-facing, available on a mobile interface and provide a range of functions including health education and counselling support, assessment of symptoms, and assistance with tasks such as scheduling. Most of the 78 apps reviewed focus on primary care and mental health, only 6 (7.59%) had a theoretical underpinning, and 10 (12.35%) complied with health information privacy regulations. Our assessment indicated that only a few apps use machine learning and natural language processing approaches, despite such marketing claims. Most apps allowed for a finite-state input, where the dialogue is led by the system and follows a predetermined algorithm. Healthbots are potentially transformative in centering care around the user; however, they are in a nascent state of development and require further research on development, automation and adoption for a population-level health impact. © 2022, The Author(s).","Learning algorithms; Marketing; mHealth; Natural language processing systems; Search engines; Chatbots; Context of use; Conversational agents; Evaluation framework; Google plays; Language processing; Mobile app; Natural languages; Processing capability; Quality healthcare; geographic distribution; health education; human; machine learning; medical information; mental health; mobile application; natural language processing; patient care; patient counseling; primary medical care; primary prevention; Review; search engine; symptom assessment; web browser; Application programs","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125272316"

Vaccine reactogenicity can potentially lead to detectable physiologic changes, thus we postulated that we could detect an individual’s initial physiologic response to a vaccine by tracking changes relative to their pre-vaccine baseline using consumer wearable devices. We explored this possibility using a smartphone app-based research platform that enabled volunteers (39,701 individuals) to share their smartwatch data, as well as self-report, when appropriate, any symptoms, COVID-19 test results, and vaccination information. Of 7728 individuals who reported at least one vaccination dose, 7298 received an mRNA vaccine, and 5674 provided adequate data from the peri-vaccine period for analysis. We found that in most individuals, resting heart rate (RHR) increased with respect to their individual baseline after vaccination, peaked on day 2, and returned to normal by day 6. This increase in RHR was greater than one standard deviation above individuals’ normal daily pattern in 47% of participants after their second vaccine dose. Consistent with other reports of subjective reactogenicity following vaccination, we measured a significantly stronger effect after the second dose relative to the first, except those who previously tested positive to COVID-19, and a more pronounced increase for individuals who received the Moderna vaccine. Females, after the first dose only, and those aged <40 years, also experienced a greater objective response after adjusting for possible confounding factors. These early findings show that it is possible to detect subtle, but important changes from an individual’s normal as objective evidence of reactogenicity, which, with further work, could prove useful as a surrogate for vaccine-induced immune response. © 2022, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Immune system; Smartphones; Vaccines; Wearable computers; elasomeran; tozinameran; Further works; Global trajectories; Immune response; Objective measure; Research platforms; Resting heart rate; Smartphone apps; Standard deviation; Vaccine development; Wearable devices; adult; aged; Article; behavior change; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 testing; female; human; immune response; male; mobile application; prospective study; resting heart rate; self report; sleep; sleep pattern; vaccination; Physiology","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128353476"

Alongside the tremendous progress in the last several decades, new challenges have emerged. The growing disparity between organ demand and supply requires optimal patient/donor selection and matching. Improvements in long-term graft and patient survival require data-driven diagnosis and management of post-transplant complications. The growing abundance of clinical, genetic, radiologic, and metabolic data in transplantation has led to increasing interest in applying machine-learning (ML) tools that can uncover hidden patterns in large datasets. ML algorithms have been applied in predictive modeling of waitlist mortality, donor–recipient matching, survival prediction, post-transplant complications diagnosis, and prediction, aiming to optimize immunosuppression and management. In this review, we provide insight into the various applications of ML in transplant medicine, why these were used to evaluate a specific clinical question, and the potential of ML to transform the care of transplant recipients. 36 articles were selected after a comprehensive search of the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print and In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations; Ovid Embase; Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Ovid); and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid). In summary, these studies showed that ML techniques hold great potential to improve the outcome of transplant recipients. Future work is required to improve the interpretability of these algorithms, ensure generalizability through larger-scale external validation, and establishment of infrastructure to permit clinical integration. © 2022, The Author(s).","Diagnosis; Machine learning; Patient treatment; Clinical data; Clinical genetics; Data driven; Demand and supply; Genetic data; Machine learning applications; Machine-learning; Matchings; Metabolic data; Patient survivals; adult; bronchiolitis obliterans; convolutional neural network; donor selection; female; graft recipient; graft survival; human; kidney transplantation; liver transplantation; lung transplantation; machine learning; male; mortality; organ transplantation; outcome assessment; Review; survival prediction; systematic review; Large dataset","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133854990"

Much of the evidence behind this claim relies on indirect measures of mental health and few studies have tested if these language features are specific to depression versus other aspects of mental health. We analysed the Tweets of 1006 participants who completed questionnaires assessing symptoms of depression and 8 other mental health conditions. Daily Tweets were subjected to textual analysis and the resulting linguistic features were used to train an Elastic Net model on depression severity, using nested cross-validation. We then tested performance in a held-out test set (30%), comparing predictions of depression versus 8 other aspects of mental health. The depression trained model had modest out-of-sample predictive performance, explaining 2.5% of variance in depression symptoms (R2 = 0.025, r = 0.16). The performance of this model was as-good or superior when used to identify other aspects of mental health: schizotypy, social anxiety, eating disorders, generalised anxiety, above chance for obsessive-compulsive disorder, apathy, but not significant for alcohol abuse or impulsivity. Machine learning analysis of social media data, when trained on well-validated clinical instruments, could not make meaningful individualised predictions regarding users’ mental health. Furthermore, language use associated with depression was non-specific, having similar performance in predicting other mental health problems. © 2022, The Author(s).","Health; Linguistics; Machine learning; Social networking (online); Surveys; Health condition; Healthy controls; Indirect measure; Language features; Linguistic features; Machine-learning; Mental health; Performance; Social media; Textual-analysis; adult; alcohol abuse; apathy; Article; computer prediction; controlled study; depression; eating disorder; elastic tissue; female; generalized anxiety disorder; human; impulsiveness; language; machine learning; male; mental health; obsessive compulsive disorder; phenotype; predictive model; questionnaire; random forest; schizotypal personality disorder; social anxiety; social media; support vector machine; Forecasting","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127241955"

This study aimed to create a machine-learning prediction model for 30-day mortality after a non-cardiac surgery that adapts to the manageable amount of clinical information as input features and is validated against multi-centered rather than single-centered data. Data were collected from 454,404 patients over 18 years of age who underwent non-cardiac surgeries from four independent institutions. We performed a retrospective analysis of the retrieved data. Only 12–18 clinical variables were used for model training. Logistic regression, random forest classifier, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep neural network methods were applied to compare the prediction performances. To reduce overfitting and create a robust model, bootstrapping and grid search with tenfold cross-validation were performed. The XGBoost method in Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) data delivers the best performance in terms of the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) (0.9376) and the area under the precision-recall curve (0.1593). The predictive performance was the best when the SNUH model was validated with Ewha Womans University Medical Center data (AUROC, 0.941). Preoperative albumin, prothrombin time, and age were the most important features in the model for each hospital.

We randomized patients (1:1) to receive crowdsourced HBV/HCV promotion materials through social media or facility-based care without promotional materials for four weeks.

As one of the most prevalent medical conditions worldwide, it is a major cause of premature death. At present, the detection, diagnosis and monitoring of hypertension are subject to several limitations. In this review, we conducted a literature search on blood pressure measurement using only a smartphone, which has the potential to overcome current limitations and thus pave the way for long-term ambulatory blood pressure monitoring on a large scale. Among the 333 articles identified, we included 25 relevant articles over the past decade (November 2011–November 2021) and analyzed the described approaches to the types of underlying data recorded with smartphone sensors, the signal processing techniques applied to construct the desired signals, the features extracted from the constructed signals, and the algorithms used to estimate blood pressure. In addition, we analyzed the validation of the proposed methods against reference blood pressure measurements. We further examined and compared the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Among the 25 articles, 23 propose an approach that requires direct contact between the sensor and the subject and two articles propose a contactless approach based on facial videos. The sample sizes in the identified articles range from three to 3000 subjects, where 8 articles used sample sizes of 85 or more subjects. Furthermore, 10 articles include hypertensive subjects in their participant pools. The methodologies applied for the evaluation of blood pressure measurement accuracy vary considerably among the analyzed articles. There is no consistency regarding the methods for blood pressure data collection and the reference blood pressure measurement and validation. Moreover, no established protocol is currently available for the validation of blood pressure measuring technologies using only a smartphone.

Here, we conduct a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic performance of deep learning (DL) algorithms for early breast and cervical cancer identification. Four subgroups are also investigated: cancer type (breast or cervical), validation type (internal or external), imaging modalities (mammography, ultrasound, cytology, or colposcopy), and DL algorithms versus clinicians. Thirty-five studies are deemed eligible for systematic review, 20 of which are meta-analyzed, with a pooled sensitivity of 88% (95% CI 85–90%), specificity of 84% (79–87%), and AUC of 0.92 (0.90–0.94). Acceptable diagnostic performance with analogous DL algorithms was highlighted across all subgroups. Therefore, DL algorithms could be useful for detecting breast and cervical cancer using medical imaging, having equivalent performance to human clinicians. However, this tentative assertion is based on studies with relatively poor designs and reporting, which likely caused bias and overestimated algorithm performance. Evidence-based, standardized guidelines around study methods and reporting are required to improve the quality of DL research. © 2022, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Diseases; Mammography; Ultrasonic applications; Breast Cancer; Cancer detection; Cervical cancers; Diagnostic performance; Early breast cancer; Early detection of breast cancer; Image-based; Imaging modality; Meta-analysis; Systematic Review; Article; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; colposcopy; cytology; deep learning; diagnostic imaging; evidence based practice; female; human; mammography; meta analysis; practice guideline; quality control; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review; ultrasound; uterine cervix cancer; validation study; Cytology","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125070351"

Just 5% of eligible patients participate in clinical research. Participants, particularly those from minority groups, cite geographical constraints, mistrust, miscommunication, and discrimination as barriers. Here, an intersectional view of inclusion in clinical trials provides significant insights into the complex and counterintuitive challenges of trial design and participant recruitment. The US FDA have recently proposed that decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) might reduce barriers and appeal to a wider range of participants by reducing the costs and commitments required for patients to participate. While common sense and early evidence suggests that allowing participants to take part in trials at or near home has advantages in terms of convenience, travel, and perhaps even infection control, it remains to be seen if DCT approaches will yield significant improvements on participant inclusivity. Some digital studies aiming to be more inclusive on a single element of inclusion, such as race, have experienced unintended consequences in other elements, like education or gender. Implementing DCTs presents new challenges including the digital divide, the exclusion of certain tests and procedures, complexities of at-home medication delivery, and the need to build new infrastructure. We present a range of challenges and opportunities for researchers to adopt and adapt DCT approaches to create reliable evidence that applies to all of us. © 2022, The Author(s).","Clinical research; Clinical trial; Common sense; Decentralised; Digital divide; Infection control; Minority groups; Single element; Trial designs; Unintended consequences; adult; article; clinical research; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; digital divide; education; female; Food and Drug Administration; gender; human; infection control; male; minority group; race; travel; Clinical research","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129707865"

However, values of key variables are often missing during model development or at prediction time, meaning that the point estimates mask significant uncertainty and can lead to over-confident decision making. We present a model of mortality risk in emergency laparotomy which instead presents a distribution of predicted risks, highlighting the uncertainty over the risk of death with an intuitive visualisation. We developed and validated our model using data from 127134 emergency laparotomies from patients in England and Wales during 2013–2019. We captured the uncertainty arising from missing data using multiple imputation, allowing prospective, patient-specific imputation for variables that were frequently missing. Prospective imputation allows early prognostication in patients where these variables are not yet measured, accounting for the additional uncertainty this induces. Our model showed good discrimination and calibration (95% confidence intervals: Brier score 0.071–0.078, C statistic 0.859–0.873, calibration error 0.031–0.059) on unseen data from 37 hospitals, consistently improving upon the current gold-standard model. The dispersion of the predicted risks varied significantly between patients and increased where prospective imputation occurred. We present a case study that illustrates the potential impact of uncertainty quantification on clinical decision making. Our model improves mortality risk prediction in emergency laparotomy and has the potential to inform decision-makers and assist discussions with patients and their families.

Body mass index (BMI) and other clinical or commercially available tools for quantifying body fat (BF) such as DXA, MRI, CT, and photonic scanners (3DPS) are often inaccurate, cost prohibitive, or cumbersome to use. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the performance of a novel automated computer vision method, visual body composition (VBC), that uses two-dimensional photographs captured via a conventional smartphone camera to estimate percentage total body fat (%BF). The VBC algorithm is based on a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN). The hypothesis is that VBC yields better accuracy than other consumer-grade fat measurements devices. 134 healthy adults ranging in age (21–76 years), sex (61.2% women), race (60.4% White; 23.9% Black), and body mass index (BMI, 18.5–51.6 kg/m2) were evaluated at two clinical sites (N = 64 at MGH, N = 70 at PBRC). Each participant had %BF measured with VBC, three consumer and two professional bioimpedance analysis (BIA) systems. The PBRC participants also had air displacement plethysmography (ADP) measured. %BF measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was set as the reference against which all other %BF measurements were compared. To test our scientific hypothesis we run multiple, pair-wise Wilcoxon signed rank tests where we compare each competing measurement tool (VBC, BIA, …) with respect to the same ground-truth (DXA). Relative to DXA, VBC had the lowest mean absolute error and standard deviation (2.16 ± 1.54%) compared to all of the other evaluated methods (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). %BF measured by VBC also had good concordance with DXA (Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient, CCC: all 0.96; women 0.93; men 0.94), whereas BMI had very poor concordance (CCC: all 0.45; women 0.40; men 0.74). Bland-Altman analysis of VBC revealed the tightest limits of agreement (LOA) and absence of significant bias relative to DXA (bias −0.42%, R2 = 0.03; p = 0.062; LOA −5.5% to +4.7%), whereas all other evaluated methods had significant (p < 0.01) bias and wider limits of agreement. Bias in Bland-Altman analyses is defined as the discordance between the y = 0 axis and the regressed line computed from the data in the plot. In this first validation study of a novel, accessible, and easy-to-use system, VBC body fat estimates were accurate and without significant bias compared to DXA as the reference; VBC performance exceeded those of all other BIA and ADP methods evaluated. The wide availability of smartphones suggests that the VBC method for evaluating %BF could play an important role in quantifying adiposity levels in a wide range of settings.

However, few studies focus on how digital approaches can be implemented to enhance community engagement in clinical trials. This narrative review examines three key areas for digital approaches to deepen community engagement in clinical trials—the use of digital technology for trial processes to decentralize trials, digital crowdsourcing to develop trial components, and digital qualitative research methods. We highlight how digital approaches enhanced community engagement through a greater diversity of participants, and deepened community engagement through the decentralization of research processes. We discuss new possibilities that digital technologies offer for community engagement, and highlight potential strengths, weaknesses, and practical considerations. We argue that strengthening community engagement using a digital approach can enhance equity and improve health outcomes. © 2022, The Author(s).","Clinical research; Crowdsourcing; Clinical trial; Community engagement; Decentralisation; Digital technologies; Health outcomes; Qualitative research methods; Research process; adult; controlled study; crowdsourcing; decentralization; digital technology; human; narrative; qualitative research; review; Medical applications","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127276260"

We evaluated self-reported actions taken in response to personal CAD PRS information, with special interest in the initiation of lipid-lowering therapy. 19% (721/3,800) of participants provided complete responses for baseline and follow-up use of lipid-lowering therapy. 20% (n = 19/95) of high CAD PRS vs 7.9% (n = 8/101) of low CAD PRS participants initiated lipid-lowering therapy at follow-up (p-value = 0.002). Both the initiation of statin and non-statin lipid-lowering therapy was associated with degree of CAD PRS: 15.2% (n = 14/92) vs 6.0% (n = 6/100) for statins (p-value = 0.018) and 6.8% (n = 8/118) vs 1.6% (n = 2/123) for non-statins (p-value = 0.022) in high vs low CAD PRS, respectively. High CAD PRS was also associated with earlier initiation of lipid lowering therapy (average age of 52 vs 65 years in high vs low CAD PRS respectively, p-value = 0.007). Overall, degree of CAD PRS was associated with use of any lipid-lowering therapy at follow-up: 42.4% (n = 56/132) vs 28.5% (n = 37/130) (p-value = 0.009). We find that digital communication of personal CAD PRS information is associated with increased and earlier lipid-lowering initiation in individuals of high CAD PRS. Loss to follow-up is the primary limitation of this study. Alternative communication routes, and long-term studies with EHR-based outcomes are needed to understand the generalizability and durability of this finding. © 2022, The Author(s).","Computer aided diagnosis; Digital communication systems; Diseases; antilipemic agent; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; Coronary artery disease; Follow up; Lipid lowering; Mobile applications; P-values; Prospectives; Risk communication; Risk score; Smart-phone applications; Statins; adult; aged; Article; body mass; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; coronary artery disease; female; follow up; genetic counseling; genetic risk score; health survey; human; informed consent; low risk patient; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mobile application; observational study; prospective study; risk factor; self report; single nucleotide polymorphism; social media; Smartphones","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126474320"

In turn, there has been a concurrent rise in secondary research studies regarding these technologies in order to influence key clinical and policymaking decisions. It is therefore essential that these studies accurately appraise methodological quality and risk of bias within shortlisted trials and reports. In order to assess whether this critical step is performed, we undertook a meta-research study evaluating adherence to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool within AI diagnostic accuracy systematic reviews. A literature search was conducted on all studies published from 2000 to December 2020. Of 50 included reviews, 36 performed the quality assessment, of which 27 utilised the QUADAS-2 tool. Bias was reported across all four domains of QUADAS-2. Two hundred forty-three of 423 studies (57.5%) across all systematic reviews utilising QUADAS-2 reported a high or unclear risk of bias in the patient selection domain, 110 (26%) reported a high or unclear risk of bias in the index test domain, 121 (28.6%) in the reference standard domain and 157 (37.1%) in the flow and timing domain. This study demonstrates the incomplete uptake of quality assessment tools in reviews of AI-based diagnostic accuracy studies and highlights inconsistent reporting across all domains of quality assessment. Poor standards of reporting act as barriers to clinical implementation. The creation of an AI-specific extension for quality assessment tools of diagnostic accuracy AI studies may facilitate the safe translation of AI tools into clinical practice. © 2022, The Author(s).","Clinical research; Accuracy study; Assessment tool; Delivery pathways; Diagnostic accuracy; Diagnostic systems; Healthcare delivery; Quality assessment; Research studies; Robust solutions; Systematic Review; adult; article; artificial intelligence; clinical practice; diagnosis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; health care delivery; human; male; patient selection; Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies; quality control; risk assessment; standard; systematic review; Artificial intelligence","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123842924"

Cost data were provided in only 50 studies, but most technologies for which this information was available cost less than 20 USD. Only 24 innovations targeted the ten NCDs responsible for the greatest number of disability-adjusted life years lost globally. Most publications evaluated products created in high-income countries. Reported mHealth technologies are well-developed, but their implementation in LMICs faces operating system incompatibility and a relative neglect of NCDs causing the greatest disease burden. © 2022, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Health care providers; Health interventions; Low income countries; Low-resource settings; Middle-income countries; Mobile applications; Mobile health application; Non-communicable disease; Systematic Review; Web of Science; Cochrane Library; disability-adjusted life year; disease burden; health care personnel; high income country; human; low income country; Medline; middle income country; mobile application; non communicable disease; Review; systematic review; Web of Science; mHealth","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135048554"

Using a case study of COVID-19 diagnosis across four NHS Hospital Trusts, we show that all methods achieve clinically-effective performances (NPV > 0.959), with transfer learning achieving the best results (mean AUROCs between 0.870 and 0.925).

Early recognition of patients at risk is a pressing clinical need to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. We assessed whether information routinely collected in electronic medical records (EMR) could enhance the prediction of preeclampsia risk beyond what is achieved in standard of care assessments. We developed a digital phenotyping algorithm to curate 108,557 pregnancies from EMRs across the Mount Sinai Health System, accurately reconstructing pregnancy journeys and normalizing these journeys across different hospital EMR systems. We then applied machine learning approaches to a training dataset (N = 60,879) to construct predictive models of preeclampsia across three major pregnancy time periods (ante-, intra-, and postpartum). The resulting models predicted preeclampsia with high accuracy across the different pregnancy periods, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of 0.92, 0.82, and 0.89 at 37 gestational weeks, intrapartum and postpartum, respectively. We observed comparable performance in two independent patient cohorts. While our machine learning approach identified known risk factors of preeclampsia (such as blood pressure, weight, and maternal age), it also identified other potential risk factors, such as complete blood count related characteristics for the antepartum period. Our model not only has utility for earlier identification of patients at risk for preeclampsia, but given the prediction accuracy exceeds what is currently achieved in clinical practice, our model provides a path for promoting personalized precision therapeutic strategies for patients at risk. © 2022, The Author(s).","Blood; Forecasting; Machine learning; Medical computing; Medical information systems; Obstetrics; Risk assessment; Adverse outcomes; Complex disease; Heterogeneous disease; Machine learning approaches; Medical record; Preeclampsia; Pregnant woman; Pressung; Risk factors; Risk predictions; adult; African American; algorithm; Article; blood cell count; blood pressure; clinical feature; clinical practice; cohort analysis; controlled study; Doppler flowmetry; electronic medical record; female; health care; health care quality; human; machine learning; major clinical study; medicaid; patient information; phenotype; predictive model; preeclampsia; pregnancy; racial disparity; receiver operating characteristic; risk factor; Blood pressure","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131324617"

For this cross-sectional study, video samples of spontaneous speech were collected from 91 de-novo, drug-naïve PD participants and 75 age and sex-matched healthy controls. Twelve facial markers covering areas of forehead, nose root, eyebrows, eyes, lateral canthal areas, cheeks, mouth, and jaw were used to quantitatively describe facial dynamics. All patients were evaluated using Movement Disorder Society-Unified PD Rating Scale and Dopamine Transporter Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography. Newly developed automated facial analysis tool enabled high-accuracy discrimination between PD and controls with area under the curve of 0.87. The prevalence of hypomimia in de-novo PD cohort was 57%, mainly associated with dysfunction of mouth and jaw movements, and decreased variability in forehead and nose root wrinkles (p < 0.001). Strongest correlation was found between reduction of lower lip movements and nigro-putaminal dopaminergic loss (r = 0.32, p = 0.002) as well as limb bradykinesia/rigidity scores (r = −0.37 p < 0.001). Hypomimia represents a frequent, early marker of motor impairment in PD that can be robustly assessed via automatic video-based analysis. Our results support an association between striatal dopaminergic deficit and hypomimia in PD. © 2022, The Author(s).","Amines; Neurophysiology; Single photon emission computed tomography; dopamine transporter; ioflupane i 123; iometopane i 123; Assessment tool; Automated video; Cross-sectional study; Disease ratings; Dopamine transporter imaging; Facial movements; Healthy controls; Movement disorders; Rating scale; Spontaneous speech; adduction; adult; aged; Article; automation; bradykinesia; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; controlled study; convolutional neural network; cross-sectional study; diagnostic accuracy; facial expression; female; forehead; human; jaw movement; lower lip; major clinical study; male; MDS-Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; mouth; movement (physiology); neuroimaging; neuropathology; nose; Parkinson disease; positivity rate; single photon emission computed tomography; upper lip; videorecording; wrinkle; Particle beams","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134409813"

Numerous systematic reviews summarize the evidence on the accuracy of AI models in diagnosing different mental disorders. This umbrella review aims to synthesize results of previous systematic reviews on the performance of AI models in diagnosing mental disorders. To identify relevant systematic reviews, we searched 11 electronic databases, checked the reference list of the included reviews, and checked the reviews that cited the included reviews. Two reviewers independently selected the relevant reviews, extracted the data from them, and appraised their quality. We synthesized the extracted data using the narrative approach. We included 15 systematic reviews of 852 citations identified. The included reviews assessed the performance of AI models in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease (n = 7), mild cognitive impairment (n = 6), schizophrenia (n = 3), bipolar disease (n = 2), autism spectrum disorder (n = 1), obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 1), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 1), and psychotic disorders (n = 1). The performance of the AI models in diagnosing these mental disorders ranged between 21% and 100%. AI technologies offer great promise in diagnosing mental health disorders. The reported performance metrics paint a vivid picture of a bright future for AI in this field. Healthcare professionals in the field should cautiously and consciously begin to explore the opportunities of AI-based tools for their daily routine. It would also be encouraging to see a greater number of meta-analyses and further systematic reviews on performance of AI models in diagnosing other common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. © 2022, The Author(s).","Data mining; Diagnosis; Diseases; Alzheimer; Autism spectrum disorders; Cognitive impairment; Electronic database; Intelligence models; Mental disorders; Performance; Reference list; Synthesised; Systematic Review; Alzheimer disease; anxiety disorder; artificial intelligence; autism; bipolar disorder; depression; diagnostic accuracy; human; mental disease; mild cognitive impairment; obsessive compulsive disorder; performance indicator; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychosis; Review; schizophrenia; systematic review (topic); Artificial intelligence","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133677588"

Awareness of the potential value of such infrastructure has been heightened by COVID-19, as the lack of a real-time, interoperable data network impaired disease identification, mitigation, and eradication. The Sepsis on FHIR collaboration establishes a dynamic, federated, and interoperable system of sepsis data from 55 hospitals using 2 distinct inpatient electronic health record systems. Here we report on phase 1, a systematic review to identify clinical variables required to define sepsis and its subtypes to produce a concept mapping of elements onto Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Relevant papers described consensus sepsis definitions, provided criteria for sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, or detailed sepsis subtypes. Studies not written in English, published prior to 1970, or “grey” literature were prospectively excluded. We analyzed 55 manuscripts yielding 151 unique clinical variables. We then mapped variables to their corresponding US Core FHIR resources and specific code values.

However, the promise of RMTs relies on user engagement, which at present is variably reported in the field. This review aimed to synthesise the RMT literature to identify how and to what extent engagement is defined, measured, and reported, and to present recommendations for the standardisation of future work. Seven databases (Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO (via Ovid), PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched in July 2020 for papers using RMT apps for symptom monitoring in adults with a health condition, prompting users to track at least three times during the study period. Data were synthesised using critical interpretive synthesis. A total of 76 papers met the inclusion criteria. Sixty five percent of papers did not include a definition of engagement. Thirty five percent included both a definition and measurement of engagement. Four synthetic constructs were developed for measuring engagement: (i) engagement with the research protocol, (ii) objective RMT engagement, (iii) subjective RMT engagement, and (iv) interactions between objective and subjective RMT engagement. The field is currently impeded by incoherent measures and a lack of consideration for engagement definitions. A process for implementing the reporting of engagement in study design is presented, alongside a framework for definition and measurement options available. Future work should consider engagement with RMTs as distinct from the wider eHealth literature, and measure objective versus subjective RMT engagement.

Localization accuracy is important in terms of model interpretability, which is crucial in clinical settings. Moreover, diagnostic performances are likely to vary depending on thresholds which define an accurate localization. In a multi-center, stand-alone clinical trial using temporal and external validation datasets of 1,050 CXRs, we evaluated localization accuracy, localization-adjusted discrimination, and calibration of a commercially available deep-learning-based CAD for detecting consolidation and pneumothorax. The CAD achieved image-level AUROC (95% CI) of 0.960 (0.945, 0.975), sensitivity of 0.933 (0.899, 0.959), specificity of 0.948 (0.930, 0.963), dice of 0.691 (0.664, 0.718), moderate calibration for consolidation, and image-level AUROC of 0.978 (0.965, 0.991), sensitivity of 0.956 (0.923, 0.978), specificity of 0.996 (0.989, 0.999), dice of 0.798 (0.770, 0.826), moderate calibration for pneumothorax. Diagnostic performances varied substantially when localization accuracy was accounted for but remained high at the minimum threshold of clinical relevance. In a separate trial for diagnostic impact using 461 CXRs, the causal effect of the CAD assistance on clinicians’ diagnostic performances was estimated. After adjusting for age, sex, dataset, and abnormality type, the CAD improved clinicians’ diagnostic performances on average (OR [95% CI] = 1.73 [1.30, 2.32]; p < 0.001), although the effects varied substantially by clinical backgrounds. The CAD was found to have high stand-alone diagnostic performances and may beneficially impact clinicians’ diagnostic performances when used in clinical settings. © 2022, The Author(s).","Computer aided diagnosis; Computer aided instruction; Deep learning; Abnormality detection; Chest radiographs; Clinical settings; Clinical trial; Computer aided detection systems; Diagnostic performance; Interpretability; Localisation; Localization accuracy; Stand -alone; adult; Article; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; consensus; controlled study; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; digital imaging and communications in medicine; false negative result; false positive result; female; human; lung consolidation; major clinical study; male; middle aged; pneumothorax; radiologist; sensitivity and specificity; sex difference; thorax radiography; Calibration","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135186983"

Mental illness is a complex multi-factorial disease associated with individual risk factors and a variety of socioeconomic, clinical associations. In order to capture these complex associations expressed in a wide variety of textual data, including social media posts, interviews, and clinical notes, natural language processing (NLP) methods demonstrate promising improvements to empower proactive mental healthcare and assist early diagnosis. We provide a narrative review of mental illness detection using NLP in the past decade, to understand methods, trends, challenges and future directions. A total of 399 studies from 10,467 records were included. The review reveals that there is an upward trend in mental illness detection NLP research.

Most applications targeted a single chronic condition (n = 25), with Alzheimer’s and other dementia being the most common (n = 18). Only one application was designed for management of multiple chronic conditions. Long-term evaluation methods are needed to continually assess the impact of applications on a range of process and health outcomes, such as usability, caregiver burden, and quality of life.

A number of machine learning studies have been conducted to predict the speed of its progression, which varies widely among different individuals, for recruiting fast progressors in future clinical trials.

Here, to suppress the overfitting caused by limited data, we propose a hybrid machine learning framework consisting of multiple convolutional neural networks that automatically extract image features from the point of view of brain segments, which are relevant to cognitive decline according to clinical findings, and a linear support vector classifier that uses extracted image features together with non-image information to make robust final predictions. The experimental results indicate that our model achieves superior performance (accuracy: 0.88, area under the curve [AUC]: 0.95) compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our framework demonstrates high generalizability as a result of evaluations using a completely different cohort dataset (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.91) collected from a different population than that used for training. © 2022, The Author(s).","Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Forecasting; Machine learning; Alzheimer; Areas under the curves; Clinical trial; Hybrid machine learning; Image features; Learning frameworks; Learning studies; Limited data; Machine-learning; Overfitting; adult; Alzheimer disease; area under the curve; Article; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep neural network; disease exacerbation; follow up; human; k fold cross validation; longitudinal study; machine learning; Mini Mental State Examination; neuroimaging; observational study; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; T1 weighted imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128294361"

However, existing methods can be time consuming, labor intensive, and subject to bias. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to provide rapid, automated, and reproducible feedback without the need for expert reviewers. We aimed to systematically review the literature and determine the ML techniques used for technical surgical skill assessment and identify challenges and barriers in the field. A systematic literature search, in accordance with the PRISMA statement, was performed to identify studies detailing the use of ML for technical skill assessment in surgery. Of the 1896 studies that were retrieved, 66 studies were included. The most common ML methods used were Hidden Markov Models (HMM, 14/66), Support Vector Machines (SVM, 17/66), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN, 17/66). 40/66 studies used kinematic data, 19/66 used video or image data, and 7/66 used both. Studies assessed the performance of benchtop tasks (48/66), simulator tasks (10/66), and real-life surgery (8/66). Accuracy rates of over 80% were achieved, although tasks and participants varied between studies. Barriers to progress in the field included a focus on basic tasks, lack of standardization between studies, and lack of datasets. ML has the potential to produce accurate and objective surgical skill assessment through the use of methods including HMM, SVM, and ANN. Future ML-based assessment tools should move beyond the assessment of basic tasks and towards real-life surgery and provide interpretable feedback with clinical value for the surgeon.

However, PPG is rarely included in large sleep studies with gold-standard sleep annotation from polysomnography. Therefore, training data-intensive state-of-the-art deep neural networks is challenging. In this work a deep recurrent neural network is first trained using a large sleep data set with electrocardiogram (ECG) data (292 participants, 584 recordings) to perform 4-class sleep stage classification (wake, rapid-eye-movement, N1/N2, and N3). A small part of its weights is adapted to a smaller, newer PPG data set (60 healthy participants, 101 recordings) through three variations of transfer learning. Best results (Cohen’s kappa of 0.65 ± 0.11, accuracy of 76.36 ± 7.57%) were achieved with the domain and decision combined transfer learning strategy, significantly outperforming the PPG-trained and ECG-trained baselines. This performance for PPG-based 4-class sleep stage classification is unprecedented in literature, bringing home sleep stage monitoring closer to clinical use. The work demonstrates the merit of transfer learning in developing reliable methods for new sensor technologies by reusing similar, older non-wearable data sets. Further study should evaluate our approach in patients with sleep disorders such as insomnia and sleep apnoea. © 2021, The Author(s).","Classification (of information); Electrocardiography; Eye movements; Learning systems; Photoplethysmography; Recurrent neural networks; Sleep research; Data set; Gold standards; Health monitoring; Learning approach; Polysomnography; Sleep disorders; Sleep monitoring; Sleep stages classifications; Sleep studies; Transfer learning; adult; aged; Article; body mass; controlled study; deep neural network; electrocardiogram; female; heart beat; heart contraction; human; long short term memory network; major clinical study; male; photoelectric plethysmography; predictive value; recurrent neural network; REM sleep; sensitivity and specificity; sleep; sleep disorder; sleep stage; slow wave sleep; stage 1 sleep; stage 2 sleep; transfer of learning; wakefulness; Deep neural networks","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115260127"

The authors provisioned one internally held-out and two external test sets to assess model generalizability and compare performance to traditional radiologist interpretation. The pipeline was evaluated on a prospective cohort of 80 radiographs, reporting a 95% diagnostic accuracy.

Although automated classification is unlikely to be perfect, few modern machine learning tools have the ability to assess their own classification confidence to recognize uncertainty that might need human review. Using automated single-channel sleep staging as a first implementation, we demonstrated that uncertainty information (as quantified using Shannon entropy) can be utilized in a “human in the loop” methodology to promote targeted review of uncertain sleep stage classifications on an epoch-by-epoch basis. Across 20 sleep studies, this feedback methodology proved capable of improving scoring agreement with the gold standard over automated scoring alone (average improvement in Cohen’s Kappa of 0.28), in a fraction of the scoring time compared to full manual review (60% reduction).

All original studies reporting ML applications in vascular surgery were included. Publication trends, disease conditions, methodologies, and outcomes were summarized. Critical appraisal was conducted using the PROBAST risk-of-bias and TRIPOD reporting adherence tools. We included 212 studies from a pool of 2235 unique articles. ML techniques were used for diagnosis, prognosis, and image segmentation in carotid stenosis, aortic aneurysm/dissection, peripheral artery disease, diabetic foot ulcer, venous disease, and renal artery stenosis. The number of publications on ML in vascular surgery increased from 1 (1991–1996) to 118 (2016–2021). Most studies were retrospective and single center, with no randomized controlled trials.

A patient’s health state can be characterized by a multitude of signals including medical imaging, clinical variables, genome sequencing, conversations between clinicians and patients, and continuous signals from wearables, among others. This high volume, personalized data stream aggregated over patients’ lives has spurred interest in developing new artificial intelligence (AI) models for higher-precision diagnosis, prognosis, and tracking. While the promise of these algorithms is undeniable, their dissemination and adoption have been slow, owing partially to unpredictable AI model performance once deployed in the real world. We posit that one of the rate-limiting factors in developing algorithms that generalize to real-world scenarios is the very attribute that makes the data exciting—their high-dimensional nature. This paper considers how the large number of features in vast digital health data can challenge the development of robust AI models—a phenomenon known as “the curse of dimensionality” in statistical learning theory.

We examined a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) model to automatically predict per-episode DRGs and corresponding cost-reflecting weights on two cohorts (paid under Medicare Severity (MS) DRG or All Patient Refined (APR) DRG), without human coding efforts. It achieved macro-averaged area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0·871 (SD 0·011) on MS-DRG and 0·884 (0·003) on APR-DRG in fivefold cross-validation experiments on the first day of ICU admission.

The target trial (i.e., NCT00478205) is a Phase III double-blind, parallel-group trial that compared the 23 mg donepezil sustained release with the 10 mg donepezil immediate release formulation in patients with moderate to severe AD. We followed the target trial’s study protocol to identify the study population, treatment regimen assignments and outcome assessments, and to set up a number of different simulation scenarios and parameters. We considered two main scenarios: (1) a one-arm simulation: simulating a standard-of-care (SOC) arm that can serve as an external control arm; and (2) a two-arm simulation: simulating both intervention and control arms with proper patient matching algorithms for comparative effectiveness analysis. In the two-arm simulation scenario, we used propensity score matching controlling for baseline characteristics to simulate the randomization process. In the two-arm simulation, higher serious adverse event (SAE) rates were observed in the simulated trials than the rates reported in original trial, and a higher SAE rate was observed in the 23 mg arm than in the 10 mg SOC arm. In the one-arm simulation scenario, similar estimates of SAE rates were observed when proportional sampling was used to control demographic variables. In conclusion, trial simulation using RWD is feasible in this example of AD trial in terms of safety evaluation. Trial simulation using RWD could be a valuable tool for post-market comparative effectiveness studies and for informing future trials’ design. Nevertheless, such an approach may be limited, for example, by the availability of RWD that matches the target trials of interest, and further investigations are warranted. © 2021, The Author(s).","Drug products; Patient treatment; donepezil; Adverse events; Alzheimer; Clinical data; Clinical trial; Comparative effectiveness; Control arms; Donepezil; Real-world; Research networks; Standard of cares; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; benign neoplasm; Charlson Comorbidity Index; clinical research; clinical study; comparative effectiveness; connective tissue disease; controlled release formulation; controlled study; double blind procedure; eye disease; female; gastrointestinal disease; heart disease; hematologic disease; hepatobiliary disease; human; infection; infestation; injury; intoxication; kidney disease; lymphatic system disease; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; mediastinum disease; mental disease; musculoskeletal disease; neurologic disease; outcome assessment; phase 3 clinical trial; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; respiratory tract disease; simulation; sustained release formulation; vascular disease; Clinical research","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105879517"

Identifying personalized dynamical models of stress-smoking responses can improve characterizations of smoking responses following stress, but techniques used to identify these models require intensive longitudinal data. This study leveraged advances in wearable sensing technology and digital markers of stress and smoking to identify person-specific models of stress and smoking system dynamics by considering stress immediately before, during, and after smoking events. Adult smokers (n = 45) wore the AutoSense chestband (respiration-inductive plethysmograph, electrocardiogram, accelerometer) with MotionSense (accelerometers, gyroscopes) on each wrist for three days prior to a quit attempt. The odds of minute-level smoking events were regressed on minute-level stress probabilities to identify person-specific dynamic models of smoking responses to stress. Simulated pulse responses to a continuous stress episode revealed a consistent pattern of increased odds of smoking either shortly after the beginning of the simulated stress episode or with a delay, for all participants. This pattern is followed by a dramatic reduction in the probability of smoking thereafter, for about half of the participants (49%). Sensor-detected stress probabilities indicate a vulnerability for smoking that may be used as a tailoring variable for just-in-time interventions to support quit attempts. © 2021, The Author(s).","Dynamic models; Probability; Smoke; Wearable sensors; Dynamical modeling; Dynamics models; High frequency sensors; Longitudinal data; Quit attempts; Sensing technology; Sensors data; Stress increase; Stress probability; Wearable sensing; adult; Article; breathing; clinical article; controlled study; electrocardiogram; female; human; male; physiological stress; probability; simulation; smoking; wrist; Accelerometers","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119855971"

Researchers have proposed various human activity recognition (HAR) systems aimed at translating measurements from smartphones into various types of physical activity. In this review, we summarized the existing approaches to smartphone-based HAR. For this purpose, we systematically searched Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles published up to December 2020 on the use of smartphones for HAR. We extracted information on smartphone body location, sensors, and physical activity types studied and the data transformation techniques and classification schemes used for activity recognition. Consequently, we identified 108 articles and described the various approaches used for data acquisition, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and activity classification, identifying the most common practices, and their alternatives. We conclude that smartphones are well-suited for HAR research in the health sciences. For population-level impact, future studies should focus on improving the quality of collected data, address missing data, incorporate more diverse participants and activities, relax requirements about phone placement, provide more complete documentation on study participants, and share the source code of the implemented methods and algorithms. © 2021, The Author(s).","Classification (of information); Data acquisition; Health; Metadata; Pattern recognition; Population statistics; Activities of Daily Living; Built-in sensors; Continuous measurements; Health research; Human activity recognition; Measurements of; Physical activity; Recognition methods; Smart phones; Systematic Review; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; daily life activity; data processing; feature extraction; female; global positioning system; human; information processing; male; medical research; Medline; middle aged; peer review; physical activity; Review; Scopus; systematic review; very elderly; Web of Science; young adult; Smartphones","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117512265"

Famous disasters include the Seveso disaster and the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear meltdown, which had disastrous health consequences. Traditional methods for studying environmental disasters are costly and time-intensive. We propose the use of electronic health records (EHR) and informatics methods to study the health effects of emergent environmental disasters in a cost-effective manner. An emergent environmental disaster is exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the Philadelphia area. Penn Medicine (PennMed) comprises multiple hospitals and facilities within the Philadelphia Metropolitan area, including over three thousand PFAS-exposed women living in one of the highest PFAS exposure areas nationwide. We developed a high-throughput method that utilizes only EHR data to evaluate the disease risk in this heavily exposed population. We replicated all five disease/conditions implicated by PFAS exposure, including hypercholesterolemia, thyroid disease, proteinuria, kidney disease and colitis, either directly or via closely related diagnoses. Using EHRs coupled with informatics enables the health impacts of environmental disasters to be more easily studied in large cohorts versus traditional methods that rely on interviews and expensive serum-based testing. By reducing cost and increasing the diversity of individuals included in studies, we can overcome many of the hurdles faced by previous studies, including a lack of racial and ethnic diversity. This proof-of-concept study confirms that EHRs can be used to study human health and disease impacts of environmental disasters and produces equivalent disease-exposure knowledge to prospective epidemiology studies while remaining cost-effective. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cost effectiveness; Disasters; Environmental impact; Population statistics; Records management; perfluoro compound; perfluoroalkyl substance; unclassified drug; Anthropogenics; Catastrophic event; Cost effective; Electronic health; Environmental disasters; Fukushima daiichi; Health records; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Philadelphia; Proof of concept; adult; Article; clinical study; cohort analysis; colitis; controlled study; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; disaster; disease risk assessment; electronic health record; evaluation study; female; high throughput technology; human; hypercholesterolemia; kidney cancer; kidney disease; kidney function; major clinical study; male; medical informatics; Pennsylvania; proof of concept; proteinuria; thyroid disease; validation study; Diagnosis","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112268484"

Here, we present a transferable embedding method (i.e., a method to transform time series signals into input features for predictive machine learning models) named PHASE (PHysiologicAl Signal Embeddings) that enables us to more accurately forecast adverse surgical outcomes based on physiological signals. We evaluate PHASE on minute-by-minute EHR data of more than 50,000 surgeries from two operating room (OR) datasets and patient stays in an intensive care unit (ICU) dataset. PHASE outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, such as long-short term memory networks trained on raw data and gradient boosted trees trained on handcrafted features, in predicting six distinct outcomes: hypoxemia, hypocapnia, hypotension, hypertension, phenylephrine, and epinephrine. In a transfer learning setting where we train embedding models in one dataset then embed signals and predict adverse events in unseen data, PHASE achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy at lower computational cost compared to conventional approaches.

Large training cohorts, however, are often required by these models to achieve high accuracy, hindering the adoption of DL-based models in scenarios with limited training data. Recently, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and related models have achieved tremendous successes in the natural language processing domain. The pretraining of BERT on a very large training corpus generates contextualized embeddings that can boost the performance of models trained on smaller datasets. Inspired by BERT, we propose Med-BERT, which adapts the BERT framework originally developed for the text domain to the structured EHR domain. Med-BERT is a contextualized embedding model pretrained on a structured EHR dataset of 28,490,650 patients. Fine-tuning experiments showed that Med-BERT substantially improves the prediction accuracy, boosting the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) by 1.21–6.14% in two disease prediction tasks from two clinical databases. In particular, pretrained Med-BERT obtains promising performances on tasks with small fine-tuning training sets and can boost the AUC by more than 20% or obtain an AUC as high as a model trained on a training set ten times larger, compared with deep learning models without Med-BERT. We believe that Med-BERT will benefit disease prediction studies with small local training datasets, reduce data collection expenses, and accelerate the pace of artificial intelligence aided healthcare. © 2021, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Forecasting; Large dataset; Natural language processing systems; Records management; Tuning; acarbose; alogliptin; brain natriuretic peptide; chlorpropamide; diuretic agent; glibenclamide; glimepiride; glipizide; insulin; linagliptin; metformin; miglitol; nateglinide; pioglitazone; repaglinide; rosiglitazone; saxagliptin; sitagliptin; tolazamide; tolbutamide; Clinical tasks; Electronic health; Embeddings; Fine tuning; Health records; High-accuracy; Large-scales; Performance; Predictive models; Training sets; adult; area under the curve; Article; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; comparative study; conceptual framework; data base; deep learning; diabetes mellitus; electronic health record; embedding; female; heart failure; human; ICD-9; laboratory test; major clinical study; male; med bidirectional encoder representations from transformer; natural language processing; outcome assessment; pancreas cancer; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; sample size; semantics; Embeddings","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106317563"

This review aimed to describe the impact of mHealth interventions on blood pressure outcomes in populations with disparities in digital health use. We conducted a systematic search to identify studies with systolic blood pressure (SBP) outcomes located in urban settings in high-income countries that included a digital health disparity population, defined as mean age ≥65 years; lower educational attainment (≥60% ≤high school education); and/or racial/ethnic minority (<50% non-Hispanic White for US studies). Interventions were categorized using an established self-management taxonomy. We conducted a narrative synthesis; among randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with a six-month SBP outcome, we conducted random-effects meta-analyses. Twenty-nine articles (representing 25 studies) were included, of which 15 were RCTs. Fifteen studies used text messaging; twelve used mobile applications. Studies were included based on race/ethnicity (14), education (10), and/or age (6). Common intervention components were: lifestyle advice (20); provision of self-monitoring equipment (17); and training on digital device use (15). In the meta-analyses of seven RCTs, SBP reduction at 6-months in the intervention group (mean SBP difference = −4.10, 95% CI: [−6.38, −1.83]) was significant, but there was no significant difference in SBP change between the intervention and control groups (p = 0.48). The use of mHealth tools has shown promise for chronic disease management but few studies have included older, limited educational attainment, or minority populations. Additional robust studies with these populations are needed to determine what interventions work best for diverse hypertensive patients. © 2021, The Author(s).","Blood; Blood pressure; Diseases; Patient treatment; Text messaging; Digital barriers; Educational attainments; Health interventions; Health technology; Meta-analysis; Randomized clinical trials; Self management; Systematic Review; Systolic blood pressure; Urban population; age; blood pressure monitoring; clinical outcome; education; ethnicity; health disparity; high income country; human; hypertension; hypertensive patient; lifestyle; mental capacity; mobile application; race; Review; self care; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; text messaging; urban population; mHealth","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111167199"

This randomized controlled, single-center, open-label trial tested the impact of a mobile health (mHealth) service tool optimized for ASCVD patient care. Patients with clinical ASCVD were enrolled and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group were provided with a smartphone application named HEART4U, while a dedicated interface integrated into the electronic healthcare record system was provided to the treating physicians. A total of 666 patients with ASCVD were enrolled, with 333 patients in each group. The estimated baseline 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease was 9.5% and 10.8% in the intervention and control groups, respectively, as assessed by the pooled cohort risk equations. The primary study endpoint was the change in the estimated risk at six months. The estimated risk increased by 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively, which did not differ significantly (P = 0.821). None of the secondary study endpoints showed significant differences between the groups. A post-hoc subgroup analysis showed the benefit was greater if a participant in the intervention group accessed the application more frequently. The present study demonstrated no significant benefits associated with the use of the mHealth tool in terms of the predefined study endpoints in stable patients with ASCVD. However, it also suggested that motivating patients to use the mHealth tool more frequently may lead to greater clinical benefit. Better design with a positive user experience needs to be considered for developing future mHealth tools for ASCVD patient care.

Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for PWD, but vaccination rates are suboptimal. The study aimed to increase influenza vaccination rate in people with self-reported diabetes. This study was a prospective, 1:1 randomized controlled trial of a 6-month Digital Diabetes Intervention in U.S. adults with diabetes. The intervention group received monthly messages through an online health platform. The control group received no intervention. Difference in self-reported vaccination rates was tested using multivariable logistic regression controlling for demographics and comorbidities. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03870997. A total of 10,429 participants reported influenza vaccination status (5158 intervention, mean age (±SD) = 46.8 (11.1), 78.5% female; 5271 control, Mean age (±SD) = 46.7 (11.2), 79.4% female). After a 6-month intervention, 64.2% of the intervention arm reported influenza vaccination, vers us 61.1% in the control arm (diff = 3.1, RR = 1.05, 95% CI [1.02, 1.08], p = 0.0013, number needed to treat = 33 to obtain 1 additional vaccination). Completion of one or more intervention messages was associated with up to an 8% increase in vaccination rate (OR 1.27, 95% CI [1.17, 1.38], p < 0.0001). The intervention improved influenza vaccination rates in PWD, suggesting that leveraging new technology to deliver knowledge and information can improve influenza vaccination rates in high-risk populations to reduce public health burden of influenza. Rapid cycle innovation could maximize the effects of these digital interventions in the future with other populations and vaccines. © 2021, The Author(s).","Health risks; Knowledge management; Comorbidities; Control arms; Control groups; Decentralised; Logistics regressions; Mean ages; Multi variables; Prospectives; Randomized controlled trial; Randomized trial; adult; Article; comorbidity; controlled study; decentralization; demography; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; digital technology; female; high risk population; human; influenza vaccination; information processing; intervention study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multivariate logistic regression analysis; outcome assessment; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; self report; treatment duration; Vaccines","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115403214"

Pulse rate variability (PRV) utilizes photoplethysmography (PPG) and recently has been used as a surrogate for HRV. Several studies have found that PRV is not entirely valid as an estimation of HRV and that several physiological factors, including the pulse transit time (PTT) and blood pressure (BP) changes, may affect PRV differently than HRV. This study aimed to assess the relationship between PRV and HRV under different BP states: hypotension, normotension, and hypertension. Using the MIMIC III database, 5 min segments of PPG and ECG signals were used to extract PRV and HRV, respectively. Several time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear indices were obtained from these signals. Bland–Altman analysis, correlation analysis, and Friedman rank sum tests were used to compare HRV and PRV in each state, and PRV and HRV indices were compared among BP states using Kruskal–Wallis tests. The findings indicated that there were differences between PRV and HRV, especially in short-term and nonlinear indices, and although PRV and HRV were altered in a similar manner when there was a change in BP, PRV seemed to be more sensitive to these changes. © 2021, The Author(s).","Blood; Electrocardiography; Frequency domain analysis; Heart; Time domain analysis; Autonomic activity; Critically-ill patients; Differential effect; Heart rate variability; Nonlinear index; Normotension; Physiological factors; Pressure change; Pulse rate variability; Pulse transit time; arterial pressure; Article; blood pressure monitoring; controlled study; correlation analysis; critically ill patient; electrocardiogram; electrocardiography; heart rate variability; human; hypertension; hypotension; Kruskal Wallis test; major clinical study; priority journal; pulse rate; rank sum test; signal processing; Blood pressure","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105889672"

Five main modalities of EMR, i.e., demographics, medication, past medical procedures, comorbidities, and laboratory results, were used as features for predictive modeling, both individually and fused together using late, middle, and early fusion. Models were evaluated in terms of precision, recall, F1-score (within 95% confidence interval). The early fusion model is the most effective predictor with 84% overall F1-score [CI 82.1–86.1]. The predictive performance of the model drops by 6 % when using recent clinical data while omitting the long-term medical history. Feature importance analysis indicates that history of cardiovascular disease, emergency room visits in the past year prior to testing, and demographic factors are predictive of the disease trajectory.

Pleural effusion was the most frequent complication of early COVID-19 infection (89/1803 patients, 4.9%) followed by cardiac arrhythmia (45/1803 patients, 2.5%). Notably, hypertension was the most significant risk factor associated with 10 different complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia, and anemia. The onset of new complications after 30 days is rare and most commonly involves pleural effusion (31–60 days: 11 patients, 61–90 days: 9 patients). Lastly, comparing the rates of complications with a propensity-matched COVID-negative hospitalized population confirmed the importance of hypertension as a risk factor for early-onset complications. Overall, the associations between pre-COVID conditions and COVID-associated complications presented here may form the basis for the development of risk assessment scores to guide clinical care pathways. © 2021, The Author(s).","Deep neural networks; Risk assessment; Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Cardiac arrhythmia; Clinical care; Clinical notes; Condition; Neural network model; Pleural effusion; Risk factors; Risks assessments; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112056247"

In many cases, researchers have no interest in a particular individual’s information but rather aim to derive insights at the level of cohorts. Here, we utilise generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create medical imaging datasets consisting entirely of synthetic patient data. The synthetic images ideally have, in aggregate, similar statistical properties to those of a source dataset but do not contain sensitive personal information. We assess the quality of synthetic data generated by two GAN models for chest radiographs with 14 radiology findings and brain computed tomography (CT) scans with six types of intracranial haemorrhages. We measure the synthetic image quality by the performance difference of predictive models trained on either the synthetic or the real dataset. We find that synthetic data performance disproportionately benefits from a reduced number of classes. Our benchmark also indicates that at low numbers of samples per class, label overfitting effects start to dominate GAN training. We conducted a reader study in which trained radiologists discriminate between synthetic and real images. In accordance with our benchmark results, the classification accuracy of radiologists improves with an increasing resolution. Our study offers valuable guidelines and outlines practical conditions under which insights derived from synthetic images are similar to those that would have been derived from real data. Our results indicate that synthetic data sharing may be an attractive alternative to sharing real patient-level data in the right setting. © 2021, The Author(s).","Computerized tomography; Hospital data processing; Information dissemination; Medical imaging; Sensitive data; Comprehensive evaluation; Data Sharing; Image generations; Medical research; Patient data; Personally identifiable information; Privacy concerns; Statistical properties; Synthetic data; Synthetic images; Article; artificial neural network; benchmarking; brain hemorrhage; computer assisted tomography; data quality; diagnostic imaging; generative adversarial network; imaging and display; information dissemination; neuroimaging; patient information; radiologist; sample size; synthetic medical image; thorax radiography; Generative adversarial networks","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115731423"

Recently, machine learning (ML) emerged as a new technology to process and identify big data relationships, enabling a new era in clinical trial design. In this study, we designed a ML model for predictively stratifying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients, ultimately reducing the required number of patients by increasing statistical power through cohort homogeneity. From the Philips eICU Research Institute (eRI) database, no less than 51,555 ARDS patients were extracted. We defined three subpopulations by outcome: (1) rapid death, (2) spontaneous recovery, and (3) long-stay patients. A retrospective univariate analysis identified highly predictive variables for each outcome. All 220 variables were used to determine the most accurate and generalizable model to predict long-stay patients. Multiclass gradient boosting was identified as the best-performing ML model. Whereas alterations in pH, bicarbonate or lactate proved to be strong predictors for rapid death in the univariate analysis, only the multivariate ML model was able to reliably differentiate the disease course of the long-stay outcome population (AUC of 0.77). We demonstrate the feasibility of prospective patient stratification using ML algorithms in the by far largest ARDS cohort reported to date. Our algorithm can identify patients with sufficiently long ARDS episodes to allow time for patients to respond to therapy, increasing statistical power.

In October 2020, the databases PsycInfo, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were systematically searched for studies that culturally adapted IMI for mental disorders. Among 9438 screened records, we identified 55 eligible articles. We extracted 17 content, methodological, and procedural components of culturally adapting IMI, aiming to consider specific situations and perspectives of the target populations. Adherence and effectiveness of the adapted IMI seemed similar to the original IMI; yet, no included study conducted a direct comparison.

Risk assessment is key for primary prevention of coronary events and coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring using computed tomography (CT) is one such non-invasive tool. Despite the proven clinical value of CAC, the current clinical practice implementation for CAC has limitations such as the lack of insurance coverage for the test, need for capital-intensive CT machines, specialized imaging protocols, and accredited 3D imaging labs for analysis (including personnel and software). Perhaps the greatest gap is the millions of patients who undergo routine chest CT exams and demonstrate coronary artery calcification, but their presence is not often reported or quantitation is not feasible. We present two deep learning models that automate CAC scoring demonstrating advantages in automated scoring for both dedicated gated coronary CT exams and routine non-gated chest CTs performed for other reasons to allow opportunistic screening. First, we trained a gated coronary CT model for CAC scoring that showed near perfect agreement (mean difference in scores = −2.86; Cohen’s Kappa = 0.89, P < 0.0001) with current conventional manual scoring on a retrospective dataset of 79 patients and was found to perform the task faster (average time for automated CAC scoring using a graphics processing unit (GPU) was 3.5 ± 2.1 s vs. 261 s for manual scoring) in a prospective trial of 55 patients with little difference in scores compared to three technologists (mean difference in scores = 3.24, 5.12, and 5.48, respectively). Then using CAC scores from paired gated coronary CT as a reference standard, we trained a deep learning model on our internal data and a cohort from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study (total training n = 341, Stanford test n = 42, MESA test n = 46) to perform CAC scoring on routine non-gated chest CT exams with validation on external datasets (total n = 303) obtained from four geographically disparate health systems. On identifying patients with any CAC (i.e., CAC ≥ 1), sensitivity and PPV was high across all datasets (ranges: 80–100% and 87–100%, respectively). For CAC ≥ 100 on routine non-gated chest CTs, which is the latest recommended threshold to initiate statin therapy, our model showed sensitivities of 71–94% and positive predictive values in the range of 88–100% across all the sites. Adoption of this model could allow more patients to be screened with CAC scoring, potentially allowing opportunistic early preventive interventions. © 2021, The Author(s).","Automation; Biomineralization; Bone; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Computerized tomography; Deep learning; Diseases; Heart; Learning systems; Program processors; Risk assessment; Software testing; calcium; 'current; Cardiovascular disease; Chest CT; Clinical practices; Clinical value; Coronary artery calciums; Coronary artery disease; Coronary calcium; Learning models; Risks assessments; adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; convolutional neural network; coronary artery calcium score; coronary artery disease; deep learning; female; human; major clinical study; male; predictive value; retrospective study; Graphics processing unit","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107441829"

This scoping review aimed to identify actionable guidance for those closely involved in AI-based prediction model (AIPM) development, evaluation and implementation including software engineers, data scientists, and healthcare professionals and to identify potential gaps in this guidance. We performed a scoping review of the relevant literature providing guidance or quality criteria regarding the development, evaluation, and implementation of AIPMs using a comprehensive multi-stage screening strategy. PubMed, Web of Science, and the ACM Digital Library were searched, and AI experts were consulted. Topics were extracted from the identified literature and summarized across the six phases at the core of this review: (1) data preparation, (2) AIPM development, (3) AIPM validation, (4) software development, (5) AIPM impact assessment, and (6) AIPM implementation into daily healthcare practice. From 2683 unique hits, 72 relevant guidance documents were identified. Substantial guidance was found for data preparation, AIPM development and AIPM validation (phases 1–3), while later phases clearly have received less attention (software development, impact assessment and implementation) in the scientific literature. The six phases of the AIPM development, evaluation and implementation cycle provide a framework for responsible introduction of AI-based prediction models in healthcare. Additional domain and technology specific research may be necessary and more practical experience with implementing AIPMs is needed to support further guidance. © 2022, The Author(s).","Digital libraries; Forecasting; Health care; Quality control; Data preparation; Impact assessments; Model development; Model evaluation; Model implementation; Model validation; Prediction modelling; Quality criteria; Scoping review; Six-phase; artificial intelligence; attention; health care practice; human; library; Medline; practice guideline; prediction; review; scientific literature; software; Web of Science; Software design","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122738619"

Drug-agnostic longitudinal analyses of prescription trajectories in a population-wide setting are needed. In this cohort study, we used 24 years of data (1.1 billion prescriptions) from the Danish prescription registry to model the risk of sequentially redeeming a drug after another. Drug pairs were used to build multistep longitudinal prescription trajectories. These were subsequently used to stratify patients and calculate survival hazard ratios between the stratified groups. The similarity between prescription histories was used to determine individuals’ best treatment option. Over the course of 122 million person-years of observation, we identified 9 million common prescription trajectories and demonstrated their predictive power using hypertension as a case. Among patients treated with agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system we identified four groups: patients prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor without change, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) without change, ACE with posterior change to ARB, and ARB posteriorly changed to ACE. In an adjusted time-to-event analysis, individuals treated with ACE compared to those treated with ARB had lower survival probability (hazard ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64–0.82]; P < 1 × 10−16). Replication in UK Biobank data showed the same trends. Prescription trajectories can provide novel insights into how individuals’ drug use change over time, identify suboptimal or futile prescriptions and suggest initial treatments different from first line therapies. Observations of this kind may also be important when updating treatment guidelines. © 2021, The Author(s).","Hazards; Patient monitoring; Patient treatment; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antihypertensive agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; Angiotensin-converting enzyme; Cohort studies; Four-group; Hazard ratio; Health status; Longitudinal analysis; Multisteps; Predictive power; Renin-angiotensin system; Treatment guidelines; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; biobank; child; cohort analysis; Denmark; disease registry; drug use; female; human; hypertension; infant; major clinical study; male; newborn; patient registry; prescribing practice; prescription; United Kingdom; Trajectories","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117716962"

We aimed to understand whether and how digital health technologies (DHTs) are absorbed in Africa, tracking Ethiopia as a key node. We conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed-MEDLINE, Embase, ScienceDirect, African Journals Online, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases from inception to 02 February 2021 for studies of any design that investigated the potential of DHTs in clinical or public health practices in Ethiopia. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021240645) and it was designed to inform our ongoing DHT-enabled randomized controlled trial (RCT) (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04216420). We found 27,493 potentially relevant citations, among which 52 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 596,128 patients, healthy individuals, and healthcare professionals. The studies involved six DHTs: mHealth (29 studies, 574,649 participants); electronic health records (13 studies, 4534 participants); telemedicine (4 studies, 465 participants); cloud-based application (2 studies, 2382 participants); information communication technology (3 studies, 681 participants), and artificial intelligence (1 study, 13,417 participants). The studies targeted six health conditions: maternal and child health (15), infectious diseases (14), non-communicable diseases (3), dermatitis (1), surgery (4), and general health conditions (15). The outcomes of interest were feasibility, usability, willingness or readiness, effectiveness, quality improvement, and knowledge or attitude toward DHTs. Five studies involved RCTs. The analysis showed that although DHTs are a relatively recent phenomenon in Ethiopia, their potential harnessing clinical and public health practices are highly visible. Their adoption and implementation in full capacity require more training, access to better devices such as smartphones, and infrastructure. DHTs hold much promise tackling major clinical and public health backlogs and strengthening the healthcare ecosystem in Ethiopia. More RCTs are needed on emerging DHTs including artificial intelligence, big data, cloud, cybersecurity, telemedicine, and wearable devices to provide robust evidence of their potential use in such settings and to materialize the WHO’s Global Strategy on Digital Health. © 2021, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Diseases; mHealth; Public health; Clinical trial; Controlled trial; Ethiopia; Global strategies; Health condition; Health practices; Health technology; Key nodes; Systematic Review; World Health Organization; adult; Africa; artificial intelligence; child health; Cochrane Library; cohort analysis; communication technology; computer security; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dermatitis; digital technology; ecosystem; electronic health record; Ethiopia; genome-wide association study; health care personnel; human; maternal welfare; Medline; non communicable disease; outcome variable; professional knowledge; public health service; randomized controlled trial (topic); retrospective study; Review; ScienceDirect; systematic review; telehealth; telemedicine; total quality management; Telemedicine","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113141711"

Unlike in other applications of machine learning, where an abundance of labeled data is available, the labeling and annotation of medical data and images require a major effort of manual work by expert clinicians who do not have the time to annotate manually. In this work, we propose a new deep learning technique (SLIVER-net), to predict clinical features from 3-dimensional volumes using a limited number of manually annotated examples. SLIVER-net is based on transfer learning, where we borrow information about the structure and parameters of the network from publicly available large datasets. Since public volume data are scarce, we use 2D images and account for the 3-dimensional structure using a novel deep learning method which tiles the volume scans, and then adds layers that leverage the 3D structure. In order to illustrate its utility, we apply SLIVER-net to predict risk factors for progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness, from optical coherence tomography (OCT) volumes acquired from multiple sites. SLIVER-net successfully predicts these factors despite being trained with a relatively small number of annotated volumes (hundreds) and only dozens of positive training examples. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that SLIVER-net significantly outperforms standard state-of-the-art deep learning techniques used for medical volumes, and its performance is generalizable as it was validated on an external testing set. In a direct comparison with a clinician panel, we find that SLIVER-net also outperforms junior specialists, and identifies AMD progression risk factors similarly to expert retina specialists. © 2021, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical imaging; biological marker; 3-dimensional; Age-related macular degeneration; Automated identification; Clinical features; Labeled data; Labelings; Learning techniques; Machine-learning; Medical data; Risk factors; age related macular degeneration; Article; automation; B scan; blindness; chemical structure; clinical feature; comparative study; convolutional neural network; deep neural network; diabetic macular edema; diagnostic imaging; drusen; empirical research; false positive result; feature extraction; human; image analysis; longitudinal study; major clinical study; optical coherence tomography; prediction; priority journal; retina image; risk factor; subretinal neovascularization; three-dimensional imaging; transfer of learning; two-dimensional imaging; Optical tomography","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111789681"

Computational models that predict the mortality risk of preterm birth in the NICU by integrating vital sign data and static clinical variables in real time may be clinically helpful and potentially superior to static prediction models. However, there is a lack of established computational models for this specific task. In this study, we developed a novel deep learning model, DeepPBSMonitor (Deep Preterm Birth Survival Risk Monitor), to predict the mortality risk of preterm infants during initial NICU hospitalization. The proposed deep learning model can effectively integrate time-series vital sign data and fixed variables while resolving the influence of noise and imbalanced data. The proposed model was evaluated and compared with other approaches using data from 285 infants. Results showed that the DeepPBSMonitor model outperforms other approaches, with an accuracy, recall, and AUC score of 0.888, 0.780, and 0.897, respectively. In conclusion, the proposed model has demonstrated efficacy in predicting the real-time mortality risk of preterm infants in initial NICU hospitalization. © 2021, The Author(s).","Blood pressure; Computation theory; Computational methods; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; 'current; Computational modelling; Learning models; Mortality risk; Preterm birth; Preterm infants; Real- time; Risk monitors; Times series; Vital sign; area under the curve; Article; birth weight; blood pressure measurement; breathing rate; child hospitalization; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; convolutional neural network; cyanotic heart disease; decision tree; deep learning; deep neural network; deep preterm birth survival risk monitor; female; gestational age; heart rate; human; major clinical study; male; mortality risk; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn; oxygen saturation; prediction; prematurity; time series analysis; very low birth weight; vital sign; Time series","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111090545"

Growing numbers of SRCs in professional and amateur contact sports have prompted closer dialog regarding player safety and welfare. Greater emphasis on awareness and education has improved SRC management, but also highlighted the difficulties of diagnosing SRC in a timely manner, particularly during matches or immediately after competition. Therefore, challenges exist in off-field assessment and return to play (RTP) protocols, with current traditional (subjective) approaches largely based on infrequent snapshot assessments. Low-cost digital technologies may provide more objective, integrated and personalized SRC assessment to better inform RTP protocols whilst also enhancing the efficiency and precision of healthcare assessment. To fully realize the potential of digital technologies in the diagnosis and management of SRC will require a significant paradigm shift in clinical practice and mindset. Here, we provide insights into SRC clinical assessment methods and the translational utility of digital approaches, with a focus on off-field digital techniques to detect key SRC metrics/biomarkers. We also provide insights and recommendations to the common benefits and challenges facing digital approaches as they aim to transition from novel technologies to an efficient, valid, reliable, and integrated clinical assessment tool for SRC. Finally, we highlight future opportunities that digital approaches have in SRC assessment and management including digital twinning and the “digital athlete”. © 2021, The Author(s).","Brain; 'current; Clinical assessments; Clinical practices; Digital technologies; Field assessment; Low-costs; Mild traumatic brain injuries; Paradigm shifts; Player safety; Sport technologies; clinical assessment tool; clinical practice; concussion; digital technology; digital twin; field study; human; Review; sport injury; Sports","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120772228"

Identification of meaningful clinical subphenotypes may benefit pathophysiological study, clinical practice, and clinical trials. Here, our aim was to derive and validate COVID-19 subphenotypes using machine learning and routinely collected clinical data, assess temporal patterns of these subphenotypes during the pandemic course, and examine their interaction with social determinants of health (SDoH). We retrospectively analyzed 14418 COVID-19 patients in five major medical centers in New York City (NYC), between March 1 and June 12, 2020. Using clustering analysis, 4 biologically distinct subphenotypes were derived in the development cohort (N = 8199). Importantly, the identified subphenotypes were highly predictive of clinical outcomes (especially 60-day mortality). Sensitivity analyses in the development cohort, and rederivation and prediction in the internal (N = 3519) and external (N = 3519) validation cohorts confirmed the reproducibility and usability of the subphenotypes. Further analyses showed varying subphenotype prevalence across the peak of the outbreak in NYC. We also found that SDoH specifically influenced mortality outcome in Subphenotype IV, which is associated with older age, worse clinical manifestation, and high comorbidity burden. Our findings may lead to a better understanding of how COVID-19 causes disease in different populations and potentially benefit clinical trial development. The temporal patterns and SDoH implications of the subphenotypes may add insights to health policy to reduce social disparity in the pandemic. © 2021, The Author(s).","Medical applications; Sensitivity analysis; corticosteroid; enoxaparin; heparin; hypertensive factor; Biological mechanisms; Clinical practices; Clinical trial; Host response; Machine-learning; New York city; Pathophysiological; Social determinants of healths; Temporal pattern; Viral infections; adult; aged; Article; clinical outcome; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease burden; emergency ward; female; hierarchical clustering; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; New York; pandemic; phenotype; prediction; prevalence; reproducibility; retrospective study; social determinants of health; temporal analysis; usability testing; validation study; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111089627"

Here we describe the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation index (CDI) model based on chest patch-derived continuous sensor data to predict COVID-19 hospitalizations in outpatient-managed COVID-19 positive individuals, achieving an overall AUC of the ROC Curve of 0.84 on 308 event negative participants, and 22 event positive participants, out of an overall study cohort of 400 participants. We retrospectively compare the performance of CDI to standard of care modalities, finding that the machine learning model outperforms the standard of care modalities in terms of both numbers of events identified and with a lower false alarm rate.

We aimed to investigate whether a smartphone-delivered wound assessment tool can expedite diagnosis and treatment of SSI after emergency abdominal surgery. This single-blinded randomised control trial (NCT02704897) enroled adult emergency abdominal surgery patients in two tertiary care hospitals. Patients were randomised (1:1) to routine postoperative care or additional access to a smartphone-delivered wound assessment tool for 30-days postoperatively. Patient-reported SSI symptoms and wound photographs were requested on postoperative days 3, 7, and 15. The primary outcome was time-to-diagnosis of SSI (Centers for Disease Control definition). 492 patients were randomised (smartphone intervention: 223; routine care: 269). There was no significant difference in the 30-day SSI rate between trial arms: 21 (9.4%) in smartphone vs 20 (7.4%, p = 0.513) in routine care. Among the smartphone group, 32.3% (n = 72) did not utilise the tool. There was no significant difference in time-to-diagnosis of SSI for patients receiving the intervention (−2.5 days, 95% CI: −6.6−1.6, p = 0.225). However, patients in the smartphone group had 3.7-times higher odds of diagnosis within 7 postoperative days (95% CI: 1.02−13.51, p = 0.043). The smartphone group had significantly reduced community care attendance (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.34−0.94, p = 0.030), similar hospital attendance (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.28−1.96, p = 0.577), and significantly better experiences in accessing care (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.17−3.53, p = 0.013).

The objective of this scoping review was to identify the key use cases for involving AI for pandemic preparedness and response from the peer-reviewed, preprint, and grey literature. The data synthesis had two parts: an in-depth review of studies that leveraged machine learning (ML) techniques and a limited review of studies that applied traditional modeling approaches. ML applications from the in-depth review were categorized into use cases related to public health and clinical practice, and narratively synthesized. One hundred eighty-three articles met the inclusion criteria for the in-depth review. Six key use cases were identified: forecasting infectious disease dynamics and effects of interventions; surveillance and outbreak detection; real-time monitoring of adherence to public health recommendations; real-time detection of influenza-like illness; triage and timely diagnosis of infections; and prognosis of illness and response to treatment. Data sources and types of ML that were useful varied by use case. The search identified 1167 articles that reported on traditional modeling approaches, which highlighted additional areas where ML could be leveraged for improving the accuracy of estimations or projections. Important ML-based solutions have been developed in response to pandemics, and particularly for COVID-19 but few were optimized for practical application early in the pandemic. These findings can support policymakers, clinicians, and other stakeholders in prioritizing research and development to support operationalization of AI for future pandemics. © 2021, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Diagnosis; Diseases; Data synthesis; Decisions makings; Grey literature; Machine learning applications; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Modeling approach; Preparedness and response; Scoping review; Traditional models; artificial intelligence; clinical decision making; clinical practice; coronavirus disease 2019; disaster preparedness; disaster response; disease surveillance; early diagnosis; emergency health service; epidemic; forecasting; human; infection; influenza; influenza A (H1N1); machine learning; pandemic; prognosis; public health; public policy; Review; severe acute respiratory syndrome; systematic review; treatment response; Public health","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107590843"

Although early research found strong associations between cell phone mobility and infection spread during the initial outbreaks in the United States, it is unclear whether this relationship persists across locations and time. We propose an interpretable statistical model to identify spatiotemporal variation in the association between mobility and infection rates. Using 1 year of US county-level data, we found that sharp drops in mobility often coincided with declining infection rates in the most populous counties in spring 2020. However, the association varied considerably in other locations and across time. Our findings are sensitive to model flexibility, as more restrictive models average over local effects and mask much of the spatiotemporal variation. We conclude that mobility does not appear to be a reliable leading indicator of infection rates, which may have important policy implications. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cellular telephones; Coronavirus; Diseases; Across time; Cell phone; County level; Infection rates; Leading indicators; Local effects; Modeling flexibility; Spatio-temporal variation; Statistic modeling; Time varying; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental temperature; epidemiological model; geographic mapping; growth rate; human; infection rate; morbidity; pharmacy (shop); physical mobility; predictor variable; recreation; seasonal variation; spring; stay-at-home order; travel; United States; urban area; workplace; Public policy","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117909099"

However, V̇O2 monitoring is largely limited to specialized laboratory settings, making its widespread monitoring elusive. Here we investigate temporal prediction of V̇O2 from wearable sensors during cycle ergometer exercise using a temporal convolutional network (TCN). Cardiorespiratory signals were acquired from a smart shirt with integrated textile sensors alongside ground-truth V̇O2 from a metabolic system on 22 young healthy adults. Participants performed one ramp-incremental and three pseudorandom binary sequence exercise protocols to assess a range of V̇O2 dynamics. A TCN model was developed using causal convolutions across an effective history length to model the time-dependent nature of V̇O2. Optimal history length was determined through minimum validation loss across hyperparameter values. The best performing model encoded 218 s history length (TCN-VO2 A), with 187, 97, and 76 s yielding <3% deviation from the optimal validation loss. TCN-VO2 A showed strong prediction accuracy (mean, 95% CI) across all exercise intensities (−22 ml min−1, [−262, 218]), spanning transitions from low–moderate (−23 ml min−1, [−250, 204]), low–high (14 ml min−1, [−252, 280]), ventilatory threshold–high (−49 ml min−1, [−274, 176]), and maximal (−32 ml min−1, [−261, 197]) exercise. Second-by-second classification of physical activity across 16,090 s of predicted V̇O2 was able to discern between vigorous, moderate, and light activity with high accuracy (94.1%).

We characterized the relationship between mentions of cocaine in song lyrics and incidence of cocaine use and mortality in the US. Incidence of cocaine use from 2002 to 2017 was obtained from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health and cocaine overdose mortality rate from 2000 to 2017 was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control. Distributed lag models were fit using ordinary least squares on the first difference to identify associations between changes in cocaine lyric mentions and changes in incidence of cocaine use and mortality.

Lag-times were confirmed with cross-correlation analyses and the association remained after accounting for street pricing of cocaine.

Furthermore, existing phenotyping algorithms are not uniformly applied across large datasets and can suffer from inconsistencies in case definitions across different algorithms. We describe here quantitative disease risk scores based on almost unsupervised methods that require minimal input from clinicians, can be applied to large datasets, and alleviate some of the main weaknesses of existing phenotyping algorithms. We show applications to phenotypic data on approximately 100,000 individuals in eMERGE, and focus on several complex diseases, including Chronic Kidney Disease, Coronary Artery Disease, Type 2 Diabetes, Heart Failure, and a few others. We demonstrate that relative to existing approaches, the proposed methods have higher prediction accuracy, can better identify phenotypic features relevant to the disease under consideration, can perform better at clinical risk stratification, and can identify undiagnosed cases based on phenotypic features available in the EHR. Using genetic data from the eMERGE-seq panel that includes sequencing data for 109 genes on 21,363 individuals from multiple ethnicities, we also show how the new quantitative disease risk scores help improve the power of genetic association studies relative to the standard use of disease phenotypes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of quantitative disease risk scores derived from rich phenotypic EHR databases to provide a more meaningful characterization of clinical risk for diseases of interest beyond the prevalent binary (case-control) classification. © 2021, The Author(s).","Classification (of information); Disease control; Diseases; Clinical risks; Disease risks; Electronic health; Genetic studies; Health records; Large datasets; Phenotypic features; Phenotyping; Risk score; Risk stratification; accuracy; adult; algorithm; Article; case control study; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; coronary artery disease; dementia; disease risk assessment; electronic health record; end stage renal disease; female; gastroesophageal reflux; genetic association study; genetic risk score; heart failure; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; phenotype; principal component analysis; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; Large dataset","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111097748"

Personalized coaching may increase adherence to PA recommendations, but it is challenging to deliver personalized coaching in a scalable manner. The objective of our study was to determine whether novel artificially intelligent (AI) coaching interventions increase PA among overweight or obese, physically inactive cancer survivors compared to a control arm that receives health information. We conducted a single-center, three-arm randomized trial with equal allocation to (1) voice-assisted AI coaching delivered by smart speaker (MyCoach), (2) autonomous AI coaching delivered by text message (SmartText), and (3) control. Data collection was automated via sensors and voice technology, effectively masking outcome ascertainment. The primary outcome was change in mean steps per day from baseline to the end of follow-up at 4 weeks. Of the 42 randomized participants, 91% were female, and 36% were Black; mean age was 62.1 years, and mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m2. The majority were breast cancer survivors (85.7%). At the end of 4 weeks follow-up, steps increased in the MyCoach arm by an average of 3618.2 steps/day; the net gain in this arm was significantly greater [net difference = 3568.9 steps/day (95% CI: 1483–5655), P value <0.001] compared to control arm, and [net difference = 2160.6 steps/day (95% CI: 11–4310), P value 0.049] compared to SmartText. In conclusion, AI-based voice-assisted coaching shows promise as a practical method of delivering scalable, individualized coaching to increase physical activity in sedentary cancer survivors. Additional research is needed to replicate these findings in a broader population of cancer survivors and to investigate the effects of these interventions in the general population.

Reductions in PET scan time or radiotracer dosage typically degrade diagnostic image quality (DIQ). Deep-learning-based reconstruction may improve DIQ, but such methods have not been clinically evaluated in a realistic multicenter, multivendor environment. In this study, we evaluated the performance and generalizability of a deep-learning-based image-quality enhancement algorithm applied to fourfold reduced-count whole-body PET in a realistic clinical oncologic imaging environment with multiple blinded readers, institutions, and scanner types. We demonstrate that the low-count-enhanced scans were noninferior to the standard scans in DIQ (p < 0.05) and overall diagnostic confidence (p < 0.001) independent of the underlying PET scanner used. Lesion detection for the low-count-enhanced scans had a high patient-level sensitivity of 0.94 (0.83–0.99) and specificity of 0.98 (0.95–0.99). Interscan kappa agreement of 0.85 was comparable to intrareader (0.88) and pairwise inter-reader agreements (maximum of 0.72). SUV quantification was comparable in the reference regions and lesions (lowest p-value=0.59) and had high correlation (lowest CCC = 0.94). Thus, we demonstrated that deep learning can be used to restore diagnostic image quality and maintain SUV accuracy for fourfold reduced-count PET scans, with interscan variations in lesion depiction, lower than intra- and interreader variations. This method generalized to an external validation set of clinical patients from multiple institutions and scanner types. Overall, this method may enable either dose or exam-duration reduction, increasing safety and lowering the cost of PET imaging. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cost reduction; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image enhancement; Image quality; Medical imaging; Quality control; Scanning; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; % reductions; Diagnostic image qualities; Enhanced scan; High costs; Image quality enhancements; Multi-vendor environment; Performance; Scan time; Tomography imaging; Whole-body; adult; aged; aorta; Article; bile duct carcinoma; body mass; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; chondrosarcoma; chronic lymphatic leukemia; clinical article; clinical evaluation; colon cancer; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted tomography; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; distant metastasis; esophagus cancer; false negative result; false positive result; female; gluteus muscle; head and neck carcinoma; human; hypermetabolism; image artifact; image quality; imaging algorithm; interrater reliability; intrarater reliability; kidney cancer; leiomyosarcoma; liver; lung cancer; lung metastasis; lymph node metastasis; lymphoma; male; maximum standardized uptake value; measurement repeatability; melanoma; middle aged; multicenter study; ordered subset expectation maximization; oropharynx cancer; pancreas islet cell tumor; positron emission tomography; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; prospective study; qualitative diagnosis; quantitative diagnosis; sarcoma; sensitivity and specificity; standardized uptake value; stomach cancer; urethra cancer; whole body PET; Positron emission tomography","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113724662"

Recent advances in federated learning enable building complex machine-learned models that are trained in a distributed fashion. These techniques facilitate the calculation of research study endpoints such that private data never leaves a given device or healthcare system. We show—on a diverse set of single and multi-site health studies—that federated models can achieve similar accuracy, precision, and generalizability, and lead to the same interpretation as standard centralized statistical models while achieving considerably stronger privacy protections and without significantly raising computational costs. This work is the first to apply modern and general federated learning methods that explicitly incorporate differential privacy to clinical and epidemiological research—across a spectrum of units of federation, model architectures, complexity of learning tasks and diseases.

Owing to the complexity of the blood glucose dynamics, it is difficult to design accurate predictive models in every circumstance, i.e., hypo/normo/hyperglycemic events. We developed deep-learning methods to predict patient-specific blood glucose during various time horizons in the immediate future using patient-specific every 30-min long glucose measurements by the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to predict future glucose levels in 5 min to 1 h. In general, the major challenges to address are (1) the dataset of each patient is often too small to train a patient-specific deep-learning model, and (2) the dataset is usually highly imbalanced given that hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes are usually much less common than normoglycemia. We tackle these two challenges using transfer learning and data augmentation, respectively. We systematically examined three neural network architectures, different loss functions, four transfer-learning strategies, and four data augmentation techniques, including mixup and generative models. Taken together, utilizing these methodologies we achieved over 95% prediction accuracy and 90% sensitivity for a time period within the clinically useful 1 h prediction horizon that would allow a patient to react and correct either hypoglycemia and/or hyperglycemia. We have also demonstrated that the same network architecture and transfer-learning methods perform well for the type 1 diabetes OhioT1DM public dataset. © 2021, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Forecasting; Glucose; Learning systems; Network architecture; Transfer learning; glucose; insulin; oral antidiabetic agent; Accurate prediction; Blood glucose; Data augmentation; Diabetes patients; Glucose level; Glycemic control; Hypoglycaemic; Patient specific; Transfer learning; Type-2 diabetes; adult; aged; Article; attention network; blood glucose monitoring; clinical article; controlled study; convolutional neural network; data analysis; data augmentation; deep learning; diabetic patient; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; glucose blood level; human; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; insulin treatment; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; recurrent neural network; sensitivity and specificity; transfer of learning; Blood","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110768348"

Building on this, we apply four different framing structures to the same generic dataset, using a sepsis risk prediction model as an example, and evaluate how framing affects model performance and learning.

We present a prognostic model predicting critical state within 28 days following COVID-19 diagnosis trained on data from US electronic health records (IBM Explorys), including demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, and hospitalization. Out of 15753 COVID-19 patients, 2050 went into critical state or deceased. Non-random train-test splits by time were repeated 100 times and led to a ROC AUC of 0.861 [0.838, 0.883] and a precision-recall AUC of 0.434 [0.414, 0.485] (median and interquartile range). The interpretability analysis confirmed evidence on major risk factors (e.g., older age, higher BMI, male gender, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) in an efficient way compared to clinical studies, demonstrating the model validity. Such personalized predictions could enable fine-graded risk stratification for optimized care management. © 2021, The Author(s).","Diagnosis; eHealth; Forecasting; Large dataset; Neurodegenerative diseases; Records management; Risk assessment; Comorbidities; Critical-state; Diagnosis model; Electronic health; Health records; Healthcare systems; Inter quartile ranges; Interpretability; Model development; Prognostic modeling; adult; age; aged; Article; body mass; cardiovascular disease; comorbidity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; critical illness; data analysis; diabetes mellitus; electronic health record; female; gender; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; model; prediction; prognosis; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; symptomatology; United States; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110980488"

We propose an AI-augmented forecast modeling framework that provides daily predictions of the expected number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths, cases, and hospitalizations during the following 4 weeks. We present an international, prospective evaluation of our models’ performance across all states and counties in the USA and prefectures in Japan. Nationally, incident mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for predicting COVID-19 associated deaths during prospective deployment remained consistently <8% (US) and <29% (Japan), while cumulative MAPE remained <2% (US) and <10% (Japan). We show that our models perform well even during periods of considerable change in population behavior, and are robust to demographic differences across different geographic locations. We further demonstrate that our framework provides meaningful explanatory insights with the models accurately adapting to local and national policy interventions. Our framework enables counterfactual simulations, which indicate continuing Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions alongside vaccinations is essential for faster recovery from the pandemic, delaying the application of interventions has a detrimental effect, and allow exploration of the consequences of different vaccination strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global emergency. In the face of substantial challenges ahead, the approach presented here has the potential to inform critical decisions. © 2021, The Author(s).","Forecasting; Disease spread; Forecast models; Geographic location; Local policies; Modeling performance; Modelling framework; Percentage error; Prospective evaluation; Prospectives; Reliable models; Article; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; forecasting; geography; human; Japan; observational study; pandemic; prospective study; social distancing; United States; vaccination; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116781679"

Mobile and wearable digital health interventions (DHI) provide an opportunity to monitor and support patients during their postoperative recovery. Lack of high-quality evidence is often cited as a barrier to DHI implementation. This review captures and appraises the current use, evidence base and reporting quality of mobile and wearable DHI following surgery. Keyword searches were performed within Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and WHO Global Index Medicus databases, together with clinical trial registries and Google scholar. Studies involving patients undergoing any surgery requiring skin incision where postoperative outcomes were measured using a DHI following hospital discharge were included, with DHI defined as mobile and wireless technologies for health to improve health system efficiency and health outcomes. Methodological reporting quality was determined using the validated mobile health evidence reporting and assessment (mERA) guidelines. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for randomised studies or MINORS depending on study type. Overall, 6969 articles were screened, with 44 articles included. The majority (n = 34) described small prospective study designs, with a high risk of bias demonstrated. Reporting standards were suboptimal across all domains, particularly in relation to data security, prior patient engagement and cost analysis. Despite the potential of DHI to improve postoperative patient care, current progress is severely restricted by limitations in methodological reporting. There is an urgent need to improve reporting for DHI following surgery to identify patient benefit, promote reproducibility and encourage sustainability. © 2021, The Author(s).","mHealth; Patient rehabilitation; Wearable technology; 'current; Clinical trial; Cochrane library; Global index; Google scholar; Health interventions; High quality; Keyword search; Systematic Review; Web of Science; adult; article; clinical trial registry; Cochrane Library; cost benefit analysis; Embase; female; hospital discharge; human; information security; male; Medline; patient care; patient engagement; practice guideline; prospective study; randomized controlled trial (topic); reproducibility; search engine; skin incision; systematic review; Web of Science; wireless communication; Surgery","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118985662"

Digital mobility outcomes (DMOs), such as real-world gait speed or step count, show promise as clinical measures in many medical conditions. However, current research is nascent and fragmented by discipline. This scoping review maps existing evidence on the clinical utility of DMOs, identifying commonalities across traditional disciplinary divides. In November 2019, 11 databases were searched for records investigating the validity and responsiveness of 34 DMOs in four diverse medical conditions (Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hip fracture). Searches yielded 19,672 unique records. After screening, 855 records representing 775 studies were included and charted in systematic maps. Studies frequently investigated gait speed (70.4% of studies), step length (30.7%), cadence (21.4%), and daily step count (20.7%). They studied differences between healthy and pathological gait (36.4%), associations between DMOs and clinical measures (48.8%) or outcomes (4.3%), and responsiveness to interventions (26.8%). Gait speed, step length, cadence, step time and step count exhibited consistent evidence of validity and responsiveness in multiple conditions, although the evidence was inconsistent or lacking for other DMOs. If DMOs are to be adopted as mainstream tools, further work is needed to establish their predictive validity, responsiveness, and ecological validity. Cross-disciplinary efforts to align methodology and validate DMOs may facilitate their adoption into clinical practice. © 2021, The Author(s).","Pulmonary diseases; Clinical measure; Clinical outcome; Clinical utility; Common ground; Cross-disciplinary; Gait speed; Medical conditions; Physical mobility; Scoping review; Step length; chronic obstructive lung disease; Cinahl; clinical outcome; clinical practice; Cochrane Library; convergent validity; daily step count; digital technology; ecological validity; Embase; femur fracture; functional status; human; Medline; multiple sclerosis; Parkinson disease; physical mobility; predictive validity; proximal femoral fracture; qualitative analysis; quality of life; Review; Scopus; step count; step length; step time; stride length; systematic review; walking speed; Web of Science; Diagnosis","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118169083"

Advances in photoplethysmography (PPG) and rPPG methods have enabled the development of contact and noncontact approaches for continuous monitoring and collection of patient health data. The contagious nature of viruses such as COVID-19 warrants noncontact methods for physiological signal estimation. However, these approaches are subject to estimation biases due to variations in environmental conditions and subject demographics. The performance of contact-based wearable sensors has been evaluated, using off-the-shelf devices across demographics. However, the measurement uncertainty of rPPG methods that estimate pulse rate has not been sufficiently tested across diverse demographic populations or environments. Quantifying the efficacy of rPPG methods in real-world conditions is critical in determining their potential viability as health monitoring solutions. Currently, publicly available face datasets accompanied by physiological measurements are typically captured in controlled laboratory settings, lacking diversity in subject skin tones, age, and cultural artifacts (e.g, bindi worn by Indian women). In this study, we collect pulse rate and facial video data from human subjects in India and Sierra Leone, in order to quantify the uncertainty in noncontact pulse rate estimation methods. The video data are used to estimate pulse rate using state-of-the-art rPPG camera-based methods, and compared against ground truth measurements captured using an FDA-approved contact-based pulse rate measurement device. Our study reveals that rPPG methods exhibit similar biases when compared with a contact-based device across demographic groups and environmental conditions. The mean difference between pulse rates measured by rPPG methods and the ground truth is found to be ~2% (1 beats per minute (b.p.m.)), signifying agreement of rPPG methods with the ground truth. We also find that rPPG methods show pulse rate variability of ~15% (11 b.p.m.), as compared to the ground truth. We investigate factors impacting rPPG methods and discuss solutions aimed at mitigating variance. © 2021, The Author(s).","Photoplethysmography; Physiology; Population statistics; Uncertainty analysis; Viruses; Continuous monitoring; Environmental conditions; Estimation bias; Ground truth; Health data; Non-contact; Patient health; Pulse rate; Rate measurements; Video data; adult; Article; controlled study; deep learning; demography; evaluation study; facial expression; female; Food and Drug Administration; human; image processing; India; limit of quantitation; male; middle aged; motion; photoelectric plethysmography; priority journal; pulse rate; randomized controlled trial; Sierra Leone; statistical bias; videorecording; Video recording","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107160066"

To enable polarization sensitivity in an OCT system, however, requires additional hardware and complexity. We developed a deep-learning method to synthesize PS-OCT images by training a generative adversarial network (GAN) on OCT intensity and PS-OCT images. The synthesis accuracy was first evaluated by the structural similarity index (SSIM) between the synthetic and real PS-OCT images. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the computational PS-OCT images was validated by separately training two image classifiers using the real and synthetic PS-OCT images for cancer/normal classification. The similar classification results of the two trained classifiers demonstrate that the predicted PS-OCT images can be potentially used interchangeably in cancer diagnosis applications.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical impact and quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving interventions evaluating TS, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) prediction tools. A systematic review on PubMed was conducted to identify RCTs involving TS/ML/DL tool interventions in the past decade. A total of 65 RCTs from 26,082 records were included. A majority of them had model development studies and generally good performance was achieved. The function of TS and ML tools in the RCTs mainly included assistive treatment decisions, assistive diagnosis, and risk stratification, but DL trials were only conducted for assistive diagnosis. Nearly two-fifths of the trial interventions showed no clinical benefit compared to standard care. Though DL and ML interventions achieved higher rates of positive results than TS in the RCTs, in trials with low risk of bias (17/65) the advantage of DL to TS was reduced while the advantage of ML to TS disappeared. The current applications of DL were not yet fully spread performed in medicine. It is predictable that DL will integrate more complex clinical problems than ML and TS tools in the future. Therefore, rigorous studies are required before the clinical application of these tools. © 2021, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Medical applications; Quality control; Artificial intelligence tools; Assistive; Clinical practices; Learning tool; Machine-learning; Model development; Prediction tools; Randomized controlled trial; Statistical machine learning; Systematic Review; artificial intelligence; clinical effectiveness; deep learning; human; prediction; quality control; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk assessment; systematic review; Diagnosis","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118363056"

In this paper, we present a method for diagnosing PD that utilizes the study of micro-expressions. We analyzed the facial action units (AU) from 1812 videos of 604 individuals (61 with PD and 543 without PD, with a mean age 63.9 y/o, sd. 7.8) collected online through a web-based tool (www.parktest.net). In these videos, participants were asked to make three facial expressions (a smiling, disgusted, and surprised face) followed by a neutral face. Using techniques from computer vision and machine learning, we objectively measured the variance of the facial muscle movements and used it to distinguish between individuals with and without PD. The prediction accuracy using the facial micro-expressions was comparable to methodologies that utilize motor symptoms. Logistic regression analysis revealed that participants with PD had less variance in AU6 (cheek raiser), AU12 (lip corner puller), and AU4 (brow lowerer) than non-PD individuals. An automated classifier using Support Vector Machine was trained on the variances and achieved 95.6% accuracy. Using facial expressions as a future digital biomarker for PD could be potentially transformative for patients in need of remote diagnoses due to physical separation (e.g., due to COVID) or immobility. © 2021, The Author(s).","Diagnosis; Regression analysis; Action Unit; Facial action; Facial Expressions; Facial muscles; Machine-learning; Mean ages; Micro-expressions; Muscle movement; Vision learning; Web-based tools; adult; aged; Article; computer vision; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; disease marker; face muscle; facial action unit; facial expression; female; human; image analysis; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; movement (physiology); musculoskeletal system parameters; online system; Parkinson disease; prediction; support vector machine; task performance; videorecording; Support vector machines","Nature Research","Retracted","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114621069"

Respiration modulates the heart rate creating excess power in the heart rate variability at a frequency equal to the respiratory rate, a phenomenon known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia. We isolate this component from the power spectral density of the heart beat interval time series, and show that the respiratory rate thus estimated is in good agreement with a validation dataset acquired from sleep studies (root mean squared error = 0.648 min−1, mean absolute error = 0.46 min−1, mean absolute percentage error = 3%). We use this respiratory rate algorithm to illuminate two potential applications (a) understanding the distribution of nocturnal respiratory rate as a function of age and sex, and (b) examining changes in longitudinal nocturnal respiratory rate due to a respiratory infection such as COVID-19. 90% of respiratory rate values for healthy adults fall within the range 11.8−19.2 min−1 with a mean value of 15.4 min−1. Respiratory rate is shown to increase with nocturnal heart rate. It also varies with BMI, reaching a minimum at 25 kg/m2, and increasing for lower and higher BMI. The respiratory rate decreases slightly with age and is higher in females compared to males for age <50 years, with no difference between females and males thereafter. The 90% range for the coefficient of variation in a 14 day period for females (males) varies from 2.3–9.2% (2.3−9.5%) for ages 20−24 yr, to 2.5−16.8% (2.7−21.7%) for ages 65−69 yr. We show that respiratory rate is often elevated in subjects diagnosed with COVID-19. In a 7 day window from D−1 to D+5 (where D0 is the date when symptoms first present, for symptomatic individuals, and the test date for asymptomatic cases), we find that 36.4% (23.7%) of symptomatic (asymptomatic) individuals had at least one measurement of respiratory rate 3 min−1 higher than the regular rate. © 2021, The Author(s).","Errors; Heart; Mean square error; Spectral density; Wearable technology; Heart beats; Heart rate variability; Heart-rate; Interval time series; Measurements of; Power; Respiratory rate; Respiratory sinus arrhythmia; Wearable applications; Wearable devices; adult; aged; algorithm; Article; asymptomatic carrier; asymptomatic disease; body mass; breathing rate; coronavirus disease 2019; female; heart rate; heart rate variability; human; major clinical study; male; nonREM sleep; polysomnography; REM sleep; sleep stage; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115210117"

We summarised the literature on remote measuring technologies, mapping methodological challenges and threats to reproducibility, and identified leading digital signals for depression. Medical and computer science databases were searched between January 2007 and November 2019. Published studies linking depression and objective behavioural data obtained from smartphone and wearable device sensors in adults with unipolar depression and healthy subjects were included. A descriptive approach was taken to synthesise study methodologies. We included 51 studies and found threats to reproducibility and transparency arising from failure to provide comprehensive descriptions of recruitment strategies, sample information, feature construction and the determination and handling of missing data. The literature is characterised by small sample sizes, short follow-up duration and great variability in the quality of reporting, limiting the interpretability of pooled results. Bivariate analyses show consistency in statistically significant associations between depression and digital features from sleep, physical activity, location, and phone use data. Machine learning models found the predictive value of aggregated features. Given the pitfalls in the combined literature, these results should be taken purely as a starting point for hypothesis generation. Since this research is ultimately aimed at informing clinical practice, we recommend improvements in reporting standards including consideration of generalisability and reproducibility, such as wider diversity of samples, thorough reporting methodology and the reporting of potential bias in studies with numerous features. © 2022, The Author(s).","Data handling; Digital devices; mHealth; Clinical science; Computer science engineerings; Digital tools; Engineering science; Health tools; Measuring technology; Mental health; Passive monitoring; Reproducibilities; Systematic Review; actimetry; adult; aged; data base; data collection method; digital technology; feasibility study; female; follow up; human; machine learning; major depression; male; patient monitoring; quality control; remote sensing; reproducibility; Review; sample size; study design; systematic review; young adult; Clinical research","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122780529"

In this context, we investigated the pragmatic application of a previously described framework for digital health validation, the Digital Health Scorecard, in a cohort of 22 popular mobile health oncology apps.

However, it is difficult to know all the relevant codes related to a phenotype due to the large number of codes available. Traditional data mining approaches often require the use of patient-level data, which hinders the ability to share data across institutions. In this project, we demonstrate that multi-center large-scale code embeddings can be used to efficiently identify relevant features related to a disease of interest. We constructed large-scale code embeddings for a wide range of codified concepts from EHRs from two large medical centers. We developed knowledge extraction via sparse embedding regression (KESER) for feature selection and integrative network analysis. We evaluated the quality of the code embeddings and assessed the performance of KESER in feature selection for eight diseases. Besides, we developed an integrated clinical knowledge map combining embedding data from both institutions. The features selected by KESER were comprehensive compared to lists of codified data generated by domain experts. Features identified via KESER resulted in comparable performance to those built upon features selected manually or with patient-level data. The knowledge map created using an integrative analysis identified disease-disease and disease-drug pairs more accurately compared to those identified using single institution data. Analysis of code embeddings via KESER can effectively reveal clinical knowledge and infer relatedness among codified concepts. KESER bypasses the need for patient-level data in individual analyses providing a significant advance in enabling multi-center studies using EHR data. © 2021, The Author(s).","Codes (symbols); Data mining; eHealth; Extraction; Feature extraction; Quality control; Records management; abatacept; adalimumab; anakinra; cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody; etanercept; folic acid; golimumab; hydroxychloroquine; infliximab; leflunomide; methotrexate; methylprednisolone; prednisone; rituximab; salazosulfapyridine; tocilizumab; tofacitinib; vedolizumab; Clinical knowledge; Electronic health; Embeddings; Features selection; Health records; Knowledge extraction; Knowledge map; Large-scales; Performance; Translational Research; Article; colonoscopy; colorectal surgery; comparative study; coronary artery disease; Crohn disease; data accuracy; data extraction; data processing; data warehouse; depression; electronic health record; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; feature learning (machine learning); feature selection; feature selection algorithm; female; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; knowledge extraction via sparse embedding regression; Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes; male; multiple sclerosis; natural language processing; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; osteoporosis; psoriasis; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; rectoscopy; rheumatoid arthritis; RxNorm; singular value decomposition; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine; ulcerative colitis; Embeddings","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118362299"

We demonstrated non-contact monitoring of heart rate and respiratory rate for extended periods of time in 15 post-operative patients.

Six patient cohorts (515,720 patients) curated from two healthcare systems in the United States across intensive care units (ICU) and emergency departments (ED) were used to train and externally and temporally validate this model. In a sequential prediction setting, COMPOSER achieved a consistently high area under the curve (AUC) (ICU: 0.925–0.953; ED: 0.938–0.945).

However, the impact of health apps on outcomes for CD remains unclear, potentially owing to both the poor adoption of formal development standards in the design process and the methodological quality of studies. A systematic search of randomised trials was performed on Medline, ScienceDirect, the Cochrane Library and Scopus to provide a comprehensive outlook and review the impact of health apps on CD. We identified 69 studies on diabetes (n = 29), cardiovascular diseases (n = 13), chronic respiratory diseases (n = 13), cancer (n = 10) or their combinations (n = 4). The apps rarely adopted developmental factors in the design stage, with only around one-third of studies reporting user or healthcare professional engagement. Apps differed significantly in content, with a median of eight behaviour change techniques adopted, most frequently pertaining to the ‘Feedback and monitoring’ (91%) and ‘Shaping knowledge’ (72%) categories. As for the study methodologies, all studies adopted a traditional randomised control trial (RCT) design, with relatively short follow-ups and limited sample sizes. Findings were not significant for the majority of studies across all CD, with most RCTs revealing a high risk of bias. To support the adoption of apps for CD management, this review reinforces the need for more robust development and appropriate study characteristics to sustain evidence generation and elucidate whether study results reflect the true benefits of apps or a biased estimate due to unsuitable designs. © 2021, The Author(s).","Diseases; Chronic conditions; Chronic disease; Condition; Design-process; Formal development; Healthcare services; Mobile app; Randomized trial; Systematic Review; Systematic searches; adult; asthma; behavior change; cardiovascular disease; chronic disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; chronic respiratory tract disease; Cochrane Library; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; follow up; health care personnel; health insurance; heart failure; heart muscle ischemia; human; hypertension; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; interrater reliability; malignant neoplasm; Medline; meta analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; ScienceDirect; Scopus; systematic review; mHealth","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116414582"

In an HIV-endemic area in rural South Africa, we used a CAD algorithm (CAD4TBv5) to interpret digital chest x-rays (CXR) as part of a mobile health screening effort. Participants with TB symptoms or CAD4TBv5 score above the triaging threshold were referred for microbiological sputum assessment. During an initial pilot phase, a low CAD4TBv5 triaging threshold of 25 was selected to maximize TB case finding. We report the performance of CAD4TBv5 in screening 9,914 participants, 99 (1.0%) of whom were found to have microbiologically proven TB. CAD4TBv5 was able to identify TB cases at the same sensitivity but lower specificity as a blinded radiologist, whereas the next generation of the algorithm (CAD4TBv6) achieved comparable sensitivity and specificity to the radiologist. The CXRs of people with microbiologically confirmed TB spanned a range of lung field abnormality, including 19 (19.2%) cases deemed normal by the radiologist. HIV serostatus did not impact CAD4TB’s performance. Notably, 78.8% of the TB cases identified during this population-based survey were asymptomatic and therefore triaged for sputum collection on the basis of CAD4TBv5 score alone. While CAD4TBv6 has the potential to replace radiologists for triaging CXRs in TB prevalence surveys, population-specific piloting is necessary to set the appropriate triaging thresholds. Further work on image analysis strategies is needed to identify radiologically subtle active TB. © 2021, The Author(s).","Computer aided analysis; Computer aided diagnosis; Diseases; Radiography; Surveys; Chest radiographs; Chest radiography; Chest x-rays; Computer-aided; Health screenings; High throughput screening; Performance; Pilot Phase; South Africa; Spectra's; adult; algorithm; Article; asymptomatic infection; computer assisted diagnosis; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; emergency health service; female; health survey; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; population research; predictive value; radiologist; receiver operating characteristic; rural area; screening; sensitivity and specificity; serology; South Africa; sputum analysis; thorax radiography; tuberculosis control; Rural areas","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116979357"

Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted electrocardiography (ECG) has been evaluated as an early-detection approach for dyskalemia. The aims of this study were to determine the clinical accuracy of AI-assisted ECG for dyskalemia and prognostic ability on clinical outcomes such as all-cause mortality, hospitalizations, and ED revisits. This retrospective cohort study was done at two hospitals within a health system from May 2019 to December 2020. In total, 26,499 patients with 34,803 emergency department (ED) visits to an academic medical center and 6492 ED visits from 4747 patients to a community hospital who had a 12-lead ECG to estimate ECG-K+ and serum laboratory potassium measurement (Lab-K+) within 1 h were included. ECG-K+ had mean absolute errors (MAEs) of ≤0.365 mmol/L. Area under receiver operating characteristic curves for ECG-K+ to predict moderate-to-severe hypokalemia (Lab-K+ ≤3 mmol/L) and moderate-to-severe hyperkalemia (Lab-K+ ≥ 6 mmol/L) were >0.85 and >0.95, respectively. The U-shaped relationships between K+ concentration and adverse outcomes were more prominent for ECG-K+ than for Lab-K+. ECG-K+ and Lab-K+ hyperkalemia were associated with high HRs for 30-day all-cause mortality. Compared to hypokalemic Lab-K+, patients with hypokalemic ECG-K+ had significantly higher risk for adverse outcomes after full confounder adjustment. In addition, patients with normal Lab-K+ but dyskalemic ECG-K+ (pseudo-positive) also exhibited more co-morbidities and had worse outcomes. Point-of-care bloodless AI ECG-K+ not only rapidly identified potentially severe hypo- and hyperkalemia, but also may serve as a biomarker for medical complexity and an independent predictor for adverse outcomes. © 2022, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Electrolytes; Hospitals; Laboratories; alanine aminotransferase; albumin; aspartate aminotransferase; bicarbonate; biological marker; brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; calcium; chloride; creatine kinase; creatinine; D dimer; glucose; hemoglobin; potassium; serum albumin; sodium; troponin I; Accuracy prediction; Adverse outcomes; Cardiovascular risk; Clinical outcome; Cohort analysis; Detection approach; Emergency departments; Hypokalemia; Outcome prediction; Point of care; abnormal value; adult; adverse outcome; alanine aminotransferase blood level; albumin blood level; all cause mortality; area under the curve; Article; artificial intelligence; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bicarbonate blood level; chloride blood level; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; community hospital; comorbidity; controlled study; creatine kinase blood level; creatinine blood level; diagnostic accuracy; diastolic blood pressure; disease severity; electrocardiography; emergency ward; female; glucose blood level; hospitalization; human; human tissue; hyperkalemia; hypokalemia; major clinical study; male; mean absolute error; multicenter study; point of care testing; potassium blood level; predictive value; proteinuria; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sinus rhythm; sodium blood level; systolic blood pressure; Electrocardiography","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123081642"

Here, we aimed to investigate whether providing fertility-related information via a smartphone application could improve fertility treatment-related literacy in participants. We performed a randomized control-group pretest posttest study and recruited participants between June 18 and 25, 2020. Participants’ fertility treatment-related literacy was assessed with a pretest that comprised of 28 questions and participants were allocated with stratified randomization to either intervention group or control group. The intervention comprised a one-week smartphone application-based provision of information on fertility-related information and the control group received general information about women’s healthcare. Effectiveness of intervention was assessed using a posttest. A total of 4137 participants were administered the questionnaire and pretest, among which 3765 participants (91.0 %) responded and were randomly allocated into either the intervention group (N = 1883) or the control group (N = 1882). A significantly higher posttest mean score was observed for the intervention group compared to the control group (P = 0.0017). We also observed that posttest scores were significantly improved compared to pretest scores in both the intervention and control group (P < 0.001).

Altoida’s Digital Neuro Signature (DNS), a longitudinal cognitive test consisting of two active digital biomarker metrics, alleviates these limitations. By comparison to conventional neuropsychological assessments, DNS results in faster evaluations (10 min vs 45–120 min), and generates higher test-retest in intraindividual assessment, as well as higher accuracy at detecting abnormal cognition. This study comparatively evaluates the performance of Altoida’s DNS and conventional neuropsychological assessments in intraindividual assessments of cognition and function by means of two semi-naturalistic observational experiments with 525 participants in laboratory and clinical settings. The results show that DNS is consistently more sensitive than conventional neuropsychological assessments at capturing longitudinal individual-level change, both with respect to intraindividual variability and dispersion (intraindividual variability across multiple tests), across three participant groups: healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease. Dispersion differences between DNS and conventional neuropsychological assessments were more pronounced with more advanced disease stages, and DNS-intraindividual variability was able to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. These findings are instrumental for patient monitoring and management, remote clinical trial assessment, and timely interventions, and will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of Alzheimer’s disease. © 2021, The Author(s).","Dispersions; Patient treatment; Well testing; amyloid beta protein; apolipoprotein E; biological marker; tau protein; Alzheimer; Assessment accuracy; Cognitive impairment; Cognitive tests; Cohort studies; Disease risks; Individual levels; Intraindividual variability; Level change; Neuropsychological assessment; adult; aged; Altoida Digital Neuro Signature; Alzheimer disease; Article; attention; augmented reality; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; Clinical Dementia Rating; clinical outcome; cognition; cohort analysis; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; disease exacerbation; dispersion; eye tracking; female; healthy aging; human; intermethod comparison; machine learning; major clinical study; male; memory; mild cognitive impairment; motor performance; neuroimaging; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observational study; patient care; patient monitoring; processing speed; reaction time; velocity; very elderly; Wechsler memory scale; Patient monitoring","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108845870"

Compression ultrasound of the legs is the diagnostic gold standard, leading to a definitive diagnosis. However, many patients with possible symptoms are not found to have a DVT, resulting in long referral waiting times for patients and a large clinical burden for specialists. Thus, diagnosis at the point of care by non-specialists is desired. We collect images in a pre-clinical study and investigate a deep learning approach for the automatic interpretation of compression ultrasound images. Our method provides guidance for free-hand ultrasound and aids non-specialists in detecting DVT. We train a deep learning algorithm on ultrasound videos from 255 volunteers and evaluate on a sample size of 53 prospectively enrolled patients from an NHS DVT diagnostic clinic and 30 prospectively enrolled patients from a German DVT clinic. Algorithmic DVT diagnosis performance results in a sensitivity within a 95% CI range of (0.82, 0.94), specificity of (0.70, 0.82), a positive predictive value of (0.65, 0.89), and a negative predictive value of (0.99, 1.00) when compared to the clinical gold standard. To assess the potential benefits of this technology in healthcare we evaluate the entire clinical DVT decision algorithm and provide cost analysis when integrating our approach into diagnostic pathways for DVT. Our approach is estimated to generate a positive net monetary benefit at costs up to £72 to £175 per software-supported examination, assuming a willingness to pay of £20,000/QALY. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cost benefit analysis; Deep learning; Diseases; Economics; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Ultrasonic imaging; Blood clots; Compression ultrasounds; Deep vein thrombosis; Gold standards; Machine-learning; Non-invasive diagnosis; Point of care; Pulmonary embolism; Ultrasound imaging; Waiting time; adult; anatomical location; Article; automation; carotid artery; comparative study; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; cross validation; deep learning; deep vein thrombosis; diagnostic test accuracy study; Doppler flowmetry; echography; female; Germany; gold standard; health care; health care cost; human; image processing; image segmentation; laboratory test; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non invasive measurement; preclinical study; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; videorecording; Willingness To Pay; Diagnosis","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115264471"

The International Classification of Disease (ICD) is a standardized and widely used method, but the manual classification is an enormously time-consuming endeavor. Natural language processing together with machine learning allows automated structuring of diagnoses using ICD-10 codes, but the limited performance of machine learning models, the necessity of gigantic datasets, and poor reliability of terminal parts of these codes restricted clinical usability. We aimed to create a high performing pipeline for automated classification of reliable ICD-10 codes in the free medical text in cardiology. We focussed on frequently used and well-defined three- and four-digit ICD-10 codes that still have enough granularity to be clinically relevant such as atrial fibrillation (I48), acute myocardial infarction (I21), or dilated cardiomyopathy (I42.0). Our pipeline uses a deep neural network known as a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Network and was trained and tested with 5548 discharge letters and validated in 5089 discharge and procedural letters. As in clinical practice discharge letters may be labeled with more than one code, we assessed the single- and multilabel performance of main diagnoses and cardiovascular risk factors. We investigated using both the entire body of text and only the summary paragraph, supplemented by age and sex. Given the privacy-sensitive information included in discharge letters, we added a de-identification step. The performance was high, with F1 scores of 0.76–0.99 for three-character and 0.87–0.98 for four-character ICD-10 codes, and was best when using complete discharge letters. Adding variables age/sex did not affect results. For model interpretability, word coefficients were provided and qualitative assessment of classification was manually performed. Because of its high performance, this pipeline can be useful to decrease the administrative burden of classifying discharge diagnoses and may serve as a scaffold for reimbursement and research applications. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cardiology; Codes (symbols); Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Diseases; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Network coding; Recurrent neural networks; Risk assessment; Scaffolds; Text processing; amlodipine; gliclazide; insulin; metformin; perindopril; prescription drug; rosuvastatin; valsartan; Discharge letters; Epidemiological studies; International classification of disease; Manual classification; Multi-labels; Multilabel; Natural languages; Neural-networks; Performance; Risk factors; acute heart infarction; adult; age; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; bidirectional gated recurrent unit neural network; cardiology; cardiovascular risk; clinical practice; congestive cardiomyopathy; deep neural network; diabetes mellitus; diagnosis; electronic health record; female; gated recurrent unit network; heart failure; human; hypertension; ICD-10; information retrieval; instrument validation; intermethod comparison; ischemic heart disease; lingua franca; male; medical information; medical terminology; natural language processing; Netherlands; prescription; priority journal; qualitative analysis; sex; word processing; Pipelines","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101734466"

The objective of this scoping review was to summarize the relevant literature and evaluate the potential of AI to improve patient safety in these eight harm domains. A structured search was used to query MEDLINE for relevant articles. The scoping review identified studies that described the application of AI for prediction, prevention, or early detection of adverse events in each of the harm domains. The AI literature was narratively synthesized for each domain, and findings were considered in the context of incidence, cost, and preventability to make projections about the likelihood of AI improving safety. Three-hundred and ninety-two studies were included in the scoping review. The literature provided numerous examples of how AI has been applied within each of the eight harm domains using various techniques. The most common novel data were collected using different types of sensing technologies: vital sign monitoring, wearables, pressure sensors, and computer vision. There are significant opportunities to leverage AI and novel data sources to reduce the frequency of harm across all domains. We expect AI to have the greatest impact in areas where current strategies are not effective, and integration and complex analysis of novel, unstructured data are necessary to make accurate predictions; this applies specifically to adverse drug events, decompensation, and diagnostic errors. © 2021, The Author(s).","Health care; Patient monitoring; Wearable sensors; warfarin; Adverse events; Data-source; Diagnostic errors; Patient safety; Pressure ulcers; Scoping review; Sensing technology; Synthesised; Venous thromboembolism; Vital signs monitoring; adverse drug reaction; aged; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; cardiovascular risk; classification algorithm; computer vision; cost; decubitus; deep vein thrombosis; deterioration; diagnostic error; early diagnosis; failure to rescue (health care); falling; fuzzy logic; healthcare associated infection; human; incidence; international normalized ratio; length of stay; lung embolism; major clinical study; Medical Subject Headings; Medline; nausea and vomiting; operative blood loss; patient safety; postoperative complication; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; priority journal; prophylaxis; Review; sepsis; sequence analysis; surgical mortality; systematic review; vital sign; Artificial intelligence","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102863962"

It is not known whether electronic medical record (EMR)-based tools improve follow-up. The aim of this study was to determine if an EMR-based order to secure cardiology follow-up appointments at hospital discharge would improve follow-up rates and hospital readmission rates. A pre-post interventional study was conducted and evaluated 39,209 cardiovascular medicine discharges within an academic center between 2012 and 2017. Follow-up rates and readmission rates were compared during 2 years prior to EMR-order implementation (pre-order era 2012–2013, n = 12,852) and 4 years after implementation (EMR-order era 2014–2017, n = 26,357). The primary endpoint was 90-day cardiovascular follow-up rates within our health system. In the overall cohort, the mean age of patients was 69.3 years [SD 14.7] and 60.7% (n = 23,827) were male. In the pre-order era, 90-day follow-up was 56.7 ± 0.4% (7286 of 12,852) and increased to 67.9 ± 0.3% (17,888 of 26,357, P < 0.001) in the EMR-order era. The use of the EMR follow-up order was independently associated with increased outpatient follow-up within 90 days after adjusting for patient demographics and payor status (OR 3.28, 95% CI 3.10–3.47, P < 0.001). The 30-day readmission rate in the pre-order era was 12.8% (1642 of 12,852) compared with 13.7% (3601 of 26,357, P = 0.016) in the EMR-order era. An EMR-based appointment order for follow-up appointment scheduling was associated with increased cardiovascular medicine follow-up, but was not associated with an observed reduction in 30-day readmission rates. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cardiology; Medical computing; % reductions; Appointment scheduling; Continuity of cares; Follow up; Health systems; Hospital discharge; Interventional; Mean ages; Medical record; Pre orderings; aged; article; cardiology; cohort analysis; controlled study; demography; electronic medical record; follow up; hospital discharge; hospital readmission; human; intervention study; major clinical study; male; outpatient; Hospitals","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105450612"

However, real-world usage of apps is typically not sustained over time, and no studies systematically examine which features increase sustained engagement with apps or the relationship between engagement features and clinical efficacy. We conducted a systematic search of the literature to identify empirical studies that (1) investigate standalone apps for depression and/or anxiety in symptomatic participants and (2) report at least one measure of engagement. Features intended to increase engagement were categorized using the persuasive system design (PSD) framework and principles of behavioral economics. Twenty-five studies with 4159 participants were included in the analysis. PSD features were commonly used, whereas behavioral economics techniques were not. Smartphone apps were efficacious in treating symptoms of anxiety and depression in randomized controlled trials, with overall small-to-medium effects (g = 0.2888, SE = 0.0999, z(15) = 2.89, p = 0.0119, Q(df = 14) = 41.93, p < 0.0001, I2 = 66.6%), and apps that employed a greater number of engagement features as compared to the control condition had larger effect sizes (β = 0.0450, SE = 0.0164, t(15) = 2.7344, p = 0.0161). We observed an unexpected negative association between PSD features and engagement, as measured by completion rate (β = −0.0293, SE = 0.0121, t(17) = 02.4142, p = 0.0281). Overall, PSD features show promise for augmenting app efficacy, though engagement, as reflected in study completion, may not be the primary factor driving this association. The results suggest that expanding the use of PSD features in mental health apps may increase clinical benefits and that other techniques, such as those informed by behavioral economics, are employed infrequently. © 2021, The Author(s).","Economics; Behavioral economics; Clinical efficacy; Design features; Empirical studies; Mental health; Meta-analysis; Real-world; Smartphone apps; Systematic Review; Systematic searches; adolescent; adult; aged; anxiety; behavioral economics; clinical outcome; depression; empiricism; female; human; major clinical study; male; mental health; meta analysis; mobile application; patient engagement; persuasive communication; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; Smartphones","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101082459"

In this paper, we used anonymized cell-phone data to quantify the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission in business establishments by building a Business Risk Index that measures transmission risk over time. The index was built using two metrics, visits per square foot and the average duration of visits, to account for both density of visits and length of time visitors linger in the business. We analyzed trends in traffic patterns to 1,272,260 businesses across eight states from January 2020 to June 2020. We found that potentially risky traffic behaviors at businesses decreased by 30% by April. Since the end of April, the risk index has been increasing as states reopen. There are some notable differences in trends across states and industries. Finally, we showed that the time series of the average Business Risk Index is useful for forecasting future COVID-19 cases at the county-level (P < 0.001). We found that an increase in a county’s average Business Risk Index is associated with an increase in positive COVID-19 cases in 1 week (IRR: 1.16, 95% CI: (1.1–1.26)). Our risk index provides a way for policymakers and hospital decision-makers to monitor the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission from businesses based on the frequency and density of visits to businesses. This can serve as an important metric as states monitor and evaluate their reopening strategies. © 2021, The Author(s).","Decision making; Risk assessment; Transmissions; Business risks; Cell phone; County level; Decision makers; Policy makers; Potential risks; Risk indices; Times series; Traffic behavior; Traffic pattern; Article; behavior assessment; commercial phenomena; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis; decision making; disease transmission; forecasting; futurology; human; infection risk; priority journal; time factor; time series analysis; trend study; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102690654"

Sleep disruptions due to unnecessary overnight vital sign monitoring are associated with delirium, cognitive impairment, weakened immunity, hypertension, increased stress, and mortality. It is also one of the most common complaints of hospital patients while imposing additional burdens on healthcare providers. Previous efforts to forgo overnight vital sign measurements and improve patient sleep used providers’ subjective stability assessment or utilized an expanded, thus harder to retrieve, set of vitals and laboratory results to predict overnight clinical risk. Here, we present a model that incorporates past values of a small set of vital signs and predicts overnight stability for any given patient-night. Using data obtained from a multi-hospital health system between 2012 and 2019, a recurrent deep neural network was trained and evaluated using ~2.3 million admissions and 26 million vital sign assessments. The algorithm is agnostic to patient location, condition, and demographics, and relies only on sequences of five vital sign measurements, a calculated Modified Early Warning Score, and patient age. We achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.966 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.956–0.967) on the retrospective testing set, and 0.971 (95% CI 0.965–0.974) on the prospective set to predict overnight patient stability. The model enables safe avoidance of overnight monitoring for ~50% of patient-nights, while only misclassifying 2 out of 10,000 patient-nights as stable. Our approach is straightforward to deploy, only requires regularly obtained vital signs, and delivers easily actionable clinical predictions for a peaceful sleep in hospitals. © 2020, The Author(s).","Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Hospitals; Patient monitoring; Recurrent neural networks; Sleep research; System stability; Clinical risks; Cognitive impairment; Condition; Confidence interval; Health care providers; Health systems; Learning models; Stability assessment; Vital sign; Vital signs monitoring; adult; Agnostic; algorithm; article; avoidance behavior; controlled study; deep learning; deep neural network; demography; early warning score; female; human; major clinical study; male; night; prediction; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; sleep; vital sign; Risk assessment","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095932899"

We present a data-driven, generic approach for identifying patients at risk of being mis- or overdiagnosed, here exemplified by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It has been estimated that 5–60% of all COPD cases are misdiagnosed. High-throughput methods are therefore needed in this domain. We have used a national patient registry, which contains hospital diagnoses for 6.9 million patients across the entire Danish population for 21 years and identified statistically significant disease trajectories for COPD patients. Using 284,154 patients diagnosed with COPD, we identified frequent disease trajectories comprising time-ordered comorbidities. Interestingly, as many as 42,459 patients did not present with these time-ordered, common comorbidities. Comparison of the individual disease history for each non-follower to the COPD trajectories, demonstrated that 9597 patients were unusual. Survival analysis showed that this group died significantly earlier than COPD patients following a trajectory. Out of the 9597 patients, we identified one subgroup comprising 2185 patients at risk of misdiagnosed COPD without the typical events of COPD patients. In all, 10% of these patients were diagnosed with lung cancer, and it seems likely that they are underdiagnosed for lung cancer as their laboratory test values and survival pattern are similar to such patients. Furthermore, only 4% had a lung function test to confirm the COPD diagnosis. Another subgroup with 2368 patients were found to be at risk of “classically” overdiagnosed COPD that survive >5.5 years after the COPD diagnosis, but without the typical complications of COPD. © 2021, The Author(s).","Biological organs; Patient monitoring; Pulmonary diseases; Trajectories; C reactive protein; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Comorbidities; Data driven; Diagnostic errors; Disease diagnosis; Generic approach; High-throughput method; Lung Cancer; Overdiagnosis; Survival analysis; adult; aged; Article; asthma; bronchitis; cancer diagnosis; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; comparative study; controlled study; diagnostic error; disease severity; female; human; illness trajectory; laboratory test; longitudinal study; lung cancer; lung function test; major clinical study; male; medical history; overall survival; priority journal; register; spirometry; survival analysis; Diagnosis","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100088869"

Doing so requires overcoming barriers of awareness, availability, and (sometimes) vaccine hesitancy. Here we focus on nudging people to vaccinate through online advertising. We conducted a pre-registered online ads campaign encouraging people to vaccinate against three diseases: influenza, human papillomavirus, and herpes zoster. Ads were shown to ~69,000 people and were compared to similar ads shown to 8.6 million people. Outcome measures were clicks on ads and future searches for relevant terms. We find that ads have two main effects: First, a congruence effect whereby ads increase the likelihood of clicks and future searches by up to 116% in people who express an interest in the disease or the vaccine. Most commercial vaccine advertising is aimed entirely at this population. Second, we observed a priming effect, where ads shown to people who were searching for terms unrelated to the vaccine could be encouraged to click on them (odds ratios of 7.5–33.0) and, more often, search for the vaccine later (hazard ratios of 6.9–157.3). We provide analysis for optimizing vaccine advertising campaign budgets to balance the two populations. These findings demonstrate that digital advertising campaigns should consider not just advertising to direct keywords or to individuals that look exactly like existing customers, but consider tangential keywords that draw a wider target population who are likely earlier in their conversion funnel, thus increasing the number of people who vaccinate and maximizing vaccines uptake. © 2021, The Author(s).","Budget control; Marketing; influenza vaccine; varicella zoster vaccine; Wart virus vaccine; Advertizing; Advertizing campaigns; Health benefits; Human papilloma virus; Main effect; Online ads; Online advertizing; Outcome measures; Priming effects; Relevant terms; Article; awareness; budget; drug marketing; funding; hazard ratio; herpes zoster; human; odds ratio; outcome assessment; papillomavirus infection; priority journal; public health; vaccination; vaccination coverage; vaccine hesitancy; Wart virus; Vaccines","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101099286"

Despite this, limited evidence exists to substantiate claims that digital alerting can improve clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to appraise the evidence on the clinical outcomes of digital alerting systems in remote monitoring through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic literature search, with no language restrictions, was performed to identify studies evaluating healthcare outcomes of digital sensor alerting systems used in remote monitoring across all (medical and surgical) cohorts. The primary outcome was hospitalisation; secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality, emergency department and outpatient visits. Standard, pooled hazard ratio and proportion of means meta-analyses were performed. A total of 33 studies met the eligibility criteria; of which, 23 allowed for a meta-analysis. A 9.6% mean decrease in hospitalisation favouring digital alerting systems from a pooled random effects analysis was noted. However, pooled weighted mean differences and hazard ratios did not reproduce this finding. Digital alerting reduced hospital LOS by a mean difference of 1.043 days. A 3% mean decrease in all-cause mortality from digital alerting systems was noted. There was no benefit of digital alerting with respect to emergency department or outpatient visits. Digital alerts can considerably reduce hospitalisation and length of stay for certain cohorts in remote monitoring.

However, the diagnostic accuracy of DL is uncertain. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms to identify pathology in medical imaging. Searches were conducted in Medline and EMBASE up to January 2020. We identified 11,921 studies, of which 503 were included in the systematic review. Eighty-two studies in ophthalmology, 82 in breast disease and 115 in respiratory disease were included for meta-analysis. Two hundred twenty-four studies in other specialities were included for qualitative review. Peer-reviewed studies that reported on the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms to identify pathology using medical imaging were included. Primary outcomes were measures of diagnostic accuracy, study design and reporting standards in the literature. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. In ophthalmology, AUC’s ranged between 0.933 and 1 for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma on retinal fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography. In respiratory imaging, AUC’s ranged between 0.864 and 0.937 for diagnosing lung nodules or lung cancer on chest X-ray or CT scan. For breast imaging, AUC’s ranged between 0.868 and 0.909 for diagnosing breast cancer on mammogram, ultrasound, MRI and digital breast tomosynthesis. Heterogeneity was high between studies and extensive variation in methodology, terminology and outcome measures was noted. This can lead to an overestimation of the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms on medical imaging. There is an immediate need for the development of artificial intelligence-specific EQUATOR guidelines, particularly STARD, in order to provide guidance around key issues in this field. © 2021, The Author(s).","Biological organs; Computerized tomography; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Eye protection; Medical imaging; Ophthalmology; Optical tomography; Pulmonary diseases; Random processes; Accuracy study; Breast disease; Design standard; Diagnostic accuracy; Medical diagnostics; Medline; Meta-analysis; Reporting standards; Study design; Systematic Review; age related macular degeneration; atelectasis; breast cancer; breast disease; cancer diagnosis; cardiomegaly; cohort analysis; deep learning; diabetic retinopathy; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic test accuracy study; digital breast tomosynthesis; echomammography; emphysema; eye disease; eye fundus; eye photography; female; glaucoma; glaucomatous optic neuropathy; hiatus hernia; human; lung cancer; lung edema; lung nodule; mammography; meta analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; optical coherence tomography; outcome assessment; pleura thickening; pneumonia; pneumothorax; priority journal; prospective study; radiodiagnosis; respiratory tract disease; retrolental fibroplasia; Review; systematic review; thorax radiography; tuberculosis; x-ray computed tomography; Pathology","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104025485"

We built, validated and tested its performance on 11,943 events of volume-controlled mechanical ventilation derived from 61,532 distinct ICU admissions and tested it on an independent, secondary dataset (200,859 ICU stays; 25,086 mechanical ventilation events). A patient “data fingerprint” of 44 features was extracted as multidimensional time series in 4-hour time steps. We used a Markov decision process, including a reward system and a Q-learning approach, to find the optimized settings for positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and ideal body weight-adjusted tidal volume (Vt). The observed outcome was in-hospital or 90-day mortality. VentAI reached a significantly increased estimated performance return of 83.3 (primary dataset) and 84.1 (secondary dataset) compared to physicians’ standard clinical care (51.1). The number of recommended action changes per mechanically ventilated patient constantly exceeded those of the clinicians. VentAI chose 202.9% more frequently ventilation regimes with lower Vt (5–7.5 mL/kg), but 50.8% less for regimes with higher Vt (7.5–10 mL/kg). VentAI recommended 29.3% more frequently PEEP levels of 5–7 cm H2O and 53.6% more frequently PEEP levels of 7–9 cmH2O. VentAI avoided high (>55%) FiO2 values (59.8% decrease), while preferring the range of 50–55% (140.3% increase). In conclusion, VentAI provides reproducible high performance by dynamically choosing an optimized, individualized ventilation strategy and thus might be of benefit for critically ill patients. © 2021, The Author(s).","Intensive care units; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; oxygen; water; Critical care; Critically-ill patients; Mechanical ventilation; Multidimensional time series; Patient data; Performance; Positive end expiratory pressures; Pressure level; Reinforcement learning algorithms; Time step; adult; aged; Article; artificial ventilation; critically ill patient; female; human; ideal body weight; intensive care; major clinical study; male; Markov decision process; mortality; positive end expiratory pressure ventilation; priority journal; Q learning; reinforcement learning (machine learning); tidal volume; time series analysis; validation process; ventilated patient; Ventilation","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101257315"

Recently, AI diagnostic systems developed from ultra-widefield fundus (UWF) images have become popular standard-of-care tools in screening for ocular fundus diseases. However, in real-world settings, these systems must base their diagnoses on images with uncontrolled quality (“passive feeding”), leading to uncertainty about their performance. Here, using 40,562 UWF images, we develop a deep learning–based image filtering system (DLIFS) for detecting and filtering out poor-quality images in an automated fashion such that only good-quality images are transferred to the subsequent AI diagnostic system (“selective eating”). In three independent datasets from different clinical institutions, the DLIFS performed well with sensitivities of 96.9%, 95.6% and 96.6%, and specificities of 96.6%, 97.9% and 98.8%, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the application of our DLIFS significantly improves the performance of established AI diagnostic systems in real-world settings.

However, there have been few simple clinical risk scores available for prompt risk stratification. The objective is to develop a simple risk score for predicting severe COVID-19 disease using territory-wide data based on simple clinical and laboratory variables. Consecutive patients admitted to Hong Kong’s public hospitals between 1 January and 22 August 2020 and diagnosed with COVID-19, as confirmed by RT-PCR, were included. The primary outcome was composite intensive care unit admission, need for intubation or death with follow-up until 8 September 2020. An external independent cohort from Wuhan was used for model validation. COVID-19 testing was performed in 237,493 patients and 4442 patients (median age 44.8 years old, 95% confidence interval (CI): [28.9, 60.8]); 50% males) were tested positive. Of these, 209 patients (4.8%) met the primary outcome. A risk score including the following components was derived from Cox regression: gender, age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, dementia, liver diseases, gastrointestinal bleeding, cancer, increases in neutrophil count, potassium, urea, creatinine, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, bilirubin, D-dimer, high sensitive troponin-I, lactate dehydrogenase, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and C-reactive protein, as well as decreases in lymphocyte count, platelet, hematocrit, albumin, sodium, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, cholesterol, glucose, and base excess. The model based on test results taken on the day of admission demonstrated an excellent predictive value. Incorporation of test results on successive time points did not further improve risk prediction. The derived score system was evaluated with out-of-sample five-cross-validation (AUC: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.82–0.91) and external validation (N = 202, AUC: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.85–0.93).

Patient Generated Health Data (PGHD) from digital devices is a potential solution, but its utility as a tool for describing experiences of people with frequent constipation is unknown. We conducted a virtual, 16-week prospective study of individuals with frequent constipation from an online wellness platform that connects mobile consumer digital devices including wearable monitors capable of passively collecting steps, sleep, and heart rate data. Participants wore a Fitbit monitoring device for the study duration and were administered daily and monthly surveys assessing constipation symptom severity and medication usage. A set of 38 predetermined day-level behavioral activity metrics were computed from minute-level data streams for steps, sleep and heart rate. Mixed effects regression models were used to compare activity metrics between constipation status (irregular or constipated vs. regular day), medication use (medication day vs. non-medication day) and the interaction of medication day with irregular or constipation days, as well as to model likelihood to treat with constipation medications based on daily self-reported symptom severity. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed with the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure for false discovery rate. This study analyzed 1540 enrolled participants with completed daily surveys (mean age 36.6 sd 10.0, 72.8% female, 88.8% Caucasian). Of those, 1293 completed all monthly surveys and 756 had sufficient Fitbit data density for analysis of activity metrics. At a daily-level, 22 of the 38 activity metrics were significantly associated with bowel movement or medication treatment patterns for constipation. Participants were measured to have fewer steps on irregular days compared to regular days (−200 steps, 95% CI [−280, −120]), longer periods of inactivity on constipated days (9.1 min, 95% CI [5.2, 12.9]), reduced total sleep time on irregular and constipated days (−2.4 min, 95% CI [−4.3, −0.4] and −4.0 min, 95% CI [−6.5, −1.4], respectively). Participants reported greater severity of symptoms for bloating, hard stool, difficulty passing, and painful bowel movements on irregular, constipation and medication days compared to regular days with no medication. Interaction analysis of medication days with irregular or constipation days observed small increases in severity compared to non-medication days. Participants were 4.3% (95% CI 3.2, 5.3) more likely to treat with medication on constipated days versus regular. No significant increase in likelihood was observed for irregular days. Daily likelihood to treat increased for each 1-point change in symptom severity of bloating (2.4%, 95% CI [2.0, 2.7]), inability to pass (2.2%, 95% CI [1.4, 3.0]) and incomplete bowel movements (1.3%, 95% CI [0.9, 1.7]). This is the first large scale virtual prospective study describing the association between passively collected PGHD and constipation symptoms and severity at a day-to-day granularity level. Constipation status, irregular or constipated, was associated with a number of activity metrics in steps and sleep, and likelihood to treat with medication increased with increasing severity for a number of constipation symptoms. Given the small magnitude of effect, further research is needed to understand the clinical relevance of these results. PGHD may be useful as a tool for describing real world patient centered experiences for people with constipation. © 2021, The Author(s).","Heart; Regression analysis; Sleep research; Surveys; digestive tract agent; Data stream; Health data; Heart-rate; Medication management; Mixed effects; Monitoring device; Patient-centered outcomes; Prospective study; Real-world; Symptom management; abdominal cramp; abdominal pain; adult; Article; behavior; bloating; clinical outcome; constipation; consumer; controlled study; daily life activity; defecation; digital technology; disease severity assessment; drug use; female; hard feces; heart rate; human; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; nausea; online support group; physical activity; priority journal; prospective study; sleep; step count; wellbeing; Digital devices","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100939337"

A low oxygen level in the blood means low oxygen in the tissues, which can ultimately lead to organ failure. Yet, contrary to heart rate variability measures, a field which has seen the development of stable standards and advanced toolboxes and software, no such standards and open tools exist for continuous oxygen saturation time series variability analysis. The primary objective of this research was to identify, implement and validate key digital oximetry biomarkers (OBMs) for the purpose of creating a standard and associated reference toolbox for continuous oximetry time series analysis. We review the sleep medicine literature to identify clinically relevant OBMs. We implement these biomarkers and demonstrate their clinical value within the context of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis on a total of n = 3806 individual polysomnography recordings totaling 26,686 h of continuous data. A total of 44 digital oximetry biomarkers were implemented. Reference ranges for each biomarker are provided for individuals with mild, moderate, and severe OSA and for non-OSA recordings. Linear regression analysis between biomarkers and the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) showed a high correlation, which reached R¯ 2= 0.82. The resulting python OBM toolbox, denoted “pobm”, was contributed to the open software PhysioZoo (physiozoo.org). Studying the variability of the continuous oxygen saturation time series using pbom may provide information on the underlying physiological control systems and enhance our understanding of the manifestations and etiology of diseases, with emphasis on respiratory diseases. © 2021, The Author(s).","Biomarkers; Computer software; Continuous time systems; Diagnosis; Disease control; Noninvasive medical procedures; Oximeters; Sleep research; Time series analysis; biological marker; Clinical use; Low oxygen; Obstructive sleep apnea; Oximetry; Oxygen saturation; Pulse oximetry; Pulse-oximetry; Respiratory function; Saturation time; Times series; adult; apnea hypopnea index; Article; cohort analysis; diagnostic value; disease severity; female; heart rate variability; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; oxygen desaturation; oxygen saturation; polysomnography; priority journal; pulse oximetry; respiratory function; sleep disordered breathing; sleep medicine; time series analysis; Oxygen","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098655108"

The labeling of large-scale samples leads to costly investment in developing deep learning algorithms. The application of human prior knowledge is an effective way to solve these problems. Previously, we developed a deep learning system for glaucoma diagnosis based on a large number of samples that had high sensitivity and specificity. However, it is a black box and the specific analytic methods cannot be elucidated. Here, we establish a hierarchical deep learning system based on a small number of samples that comprehensively simulates the diagnostic thinking of human experts. This system can extract the anatomical characteristics of the fundus images, including the optic disc, optic cup, and appearance of the retinal nerve fiber layer to realize automatic diagnosis of glaucoma. In addition, this system is transparent and interpretable, and the intermediate process of prediction can be visualized. Applying this system to three validation datasets of fundus images, we demonstrate performance comparable to that of human experts in diagnosing glaucoma. Moreover, it markedly improves the diagnostic accuracy of ophthalmologists. This system may expedite the screening and diagnosis of glaucoma, resulting in improved clinical outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Ophthalmology; Transparency; Fundus image; Human expert; Interpretability; Labelings; Large-scales; Learning approach; Number of samples; Prior-knowledge; Real-world; Small samples; adult; Article; computer assisted diagnosis; controlled study; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; glaucoma; glaucomatous optic neuropathy; human; image segmentation; intraocular pressure; major clinical study; male; middle aged; missed diagnosis; ophthalmologist; optic nerve fiber; prediction; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; Diagnosis","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102458921"

However, there is an ongoing debate on its potential efficacy, especially in light of region-specific demographics. We built an expanded SIR model of COVID-19 epidemics that accounts for region-specific population densities, and we used it to test the impact of a contact-tracing app in a number of scenarios. Using demographic and mobility data from Italy and Spain, we used the model to simulate scenarios that vary in baseline contact rates, population densities, and fraction of app users in the population. Our results show that, in support of efficient isolation of symptomatic cases, app-mediated contact-tracing can successfully mitigate the epidemic even with a relatively small fraction of users, and even suppress altogether with a larger fraction of users. However, when regional differences in population density are taken into consideration, the epidemic can be significantly harder to contain in higher density areas, highlighting potential limitations of this intervention in specific contexts. This work corroborates previous results in favor of app-mediated contact-tracing as mitigation measure for COVID-19, and draws attention on the importance of region-specific demographic and mobility factors to achieve maximum efficacy in containment policies. © 2021, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Epidemiology; Population distribution; Population dynamics; User profile; Contact tracing; Demographic data; Demographic factors; Mitigation measures; Mobility datum; Mobility factors; Population densities; Potential efficacy; Regional differences; SIR model; Article; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; epidemic; home quarantine; human; Italy; mobile application; population density; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Spain; Population statistics","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099382019"

However, patient responses to IO are variable and influenced by a heterogeneous combination of health, immune, and tumor factors. There is a pressing need to discover the distinct NSCLC subgroups that influence response. We have developed a deep patient graph convolutional network, we call “DeePaN”, to discover NSCLC complexity across data modalities impacting IO benefit. DeePaN employs high-dimensional data derived from both real-world evidence (RWE)-based electronic health records (EHRs) and genomics across 1937 IO-treated NSCLC patients. DeePaN demonstrated effectiveness to stratify patients into subgroups with significantly different (P-value of 2.2 × 10−11) overall median survival of 20.35 months and 9.42 months post-IO therapy. Significant differences in IO outcome were not seen from multiple non-graph-based unsupervised methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that patient stratification from DeePaN has the potential to augment the emerging IO biomarker of tumor mutation burden (TMB). Characterization of the subgroups discovered by DeePaN indicates potential to inform IO therapeutic insight, including the enrichment of mutated KRAS and high blood monocyte count in the IO beneficial and IO non-beneficial subgroups, respectively. Our work has proven the concept that graph-based AI is feasible and can effectively integrate high-dimensional genomic and EHR data to meaningfully stratify cancer patients on distinct clinical outcomes, with potential to inform precision oncology. © 2021, The Author(s).","Biological organs; Blood; Clustering algorithms; Convolution; Diseases; Graphic methods; Oncology; Patient treatment; Tumors; antineoplastic monoclonal antibody; biological marker; hemoglobin; K ras protein; lactate dehydrogenase; programmed death 1 ligand 1; programmed death 1 receptor; Cancer patients; Convolutional networks; Electronic health; Genomics; Graph-based; Health records; Lung Cancer; Non small cell lung cancer; Patient response; Therapeutic landscapes; adult; aged; Article; cancer immunotherapy; clinical decision making; clinical feature; clinical outcome; clustering algorithm; cohort analysis; convolutional neural network; deep patient graph convolutional network; demography; electronic health record; female; health care access; human; ICD-10; ICD-9; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; median survival time; monocyte count; non small cell lung cancer; oncogenomics; overall survival; priority journal; secondary analysis; treatment response; tumor microenvironment; tumor mutation burden; tumor volume; Genes","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100356312"

Nonetheless, accurate prediction remains unavailable. Although machine learning has shown promise in many fields, including medical diagnosis and prognosis, such models are rarely deployed in real-world settings due to a lack of transparency and trustworthiness. To address these drawbacks, we propose a machine learning-based framework that is explainable and aligns with clinical domain knowledge. To build such a framework, additional layers of statistical inference and human expert validation are added to the model, which ensures the predicted risk score’s trustworthiness. Using 831 patients with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury to build a model using the proposed framework, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy of 0.8085 and 0.7488 were achieved, respectively, in determining which patients will experience poor functional outcomes. The performance of the machine learning classifier is not adversely affected by the imposition of statistical and domain knowledge “checks and balances”.

We observed that clinicopathologic features such as T-category, N-category, and grade explained a small fraction of the variance in DLS scores (R2 = 18% in both validation sets). Next, we generated human-interpretable histologic features by clustering embeddings from a deep-learning-based image-similarity model and showed that they explained the majority of the variance (R2 of 73–80%). Furthermore, the clustering-derived feature most strongly associated with high DLS scores was also highly prognostic in isolation. With a distinct visual appearance (poorly differentiated tumor cell clusters adjacent to adipose tissue), this feature was identified by annotators with 87.0–95.5% accuracy. Our approach can be used to explain predictions from a prognostic deep learning model and uncover potentially-novel prognostic features that can be reliably identified by people for future validation studies. © 2021, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Diseases; Dynamic light scattering; Forecasting; Clusterings; Derived features; Disease-specific survivals; Embeddings; Image similarity modeling; Predictive values; Survival prediction; Tumour cells; Validation sets; Visual appearance; adipose tissue; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical feature; colorectal cancer; deep learning; disease specific survival; female; histology; histopathology; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; predictive value; priority journal; retrospective study; survival prediction; tumor cell; tumor depth; Learning systems","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104536402"

Here, we utilized an accelerometer and electrocardiogram incorporated within a digital medicine system, which also provides objective medication ingestion records, to explore markers of patient activity and investigate whether these markers of behavioral change are related to medication adherence. We developed an activity rhythm score to measure the consistency of step count patterns across the treatment regimen and explored the intensity of activity during active intervals. We then compared these activity features to ingestion behavior, both on a daily basis, using daily features and single-day ingestion behavior, and at the patient-level, using aggregate features and overall ingestion rates. Higher values of the single-day features for both the activity rhythm and activity intensity scores were associated with higher rates of ingestion on the following day. Patients with a mean activity rhythm score greater than the patient-level median were also shown to have higher overall ingestion rates than patients with lower activity rhythm scores (p = 0.004).

Our AI prognosis system, trained using data from 3661 patients, achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.786 (95% CI: 0.745–0.830) when predicting deterioration within 96 hours. The deep neural network extracts informative areas of chest X-ray images to assist clinicians in interpreting the predictions and performs comparably to two radiologists in a reader study. In order to verify performance in a real clinical setting, we silently deployed a preliminary version of the deep neural network at New York University Langone Health during the first wave of the pandemic, which produced accurate predictions in real-time.

In this work we use time series of online search query frequencies to gain insights about the prevalence of COVID-19 in multiple countries. We first develop unsupervised modelling techniques based on associated symptom categories identified by the United Kingdom’s National Health Service and Public Health England. We then attempt to minimise an expected bias in these signals caused by public interest—as opposed to infections—using the proportion of news media coverage devoted to COVID-19 as a proxy indicator. Our analysis indicates that models based on online searches precede the reported confirmed cases and deaths by 16.7 (10.2–23.2) and 22.1 (17.4–26.9) days, respectively. We also investigate transfer learning techniques for mapping supervised models from countries where the spread of the disease has progressed extensively to countries that are in earlier phases of their respective epidemic curves. Furthermore, we compare time series of online search activity against confirmed COVID-19 cases or deaths jointly across multiple countries, uncovering interesting querying patterns, including the finding that rarer symptoms are better predictors than common ones. Finally, we show that web searches improve the short-term forecasting accuracy of autoregressive models for COVID-19 deaths. Our work provides evidence that online search data can be used to develop complementary public health surveillance methods to help inform the COVID-19 response in conjunction with more established approaches. © 2021, The Author(s).","Learning systems; Public health; Time series; Gain insight; Infectious disease; Modelling techniques; National health services; Property; Query frequencies; Search behavior; Search queries; Times series; United kingdom; Article; Australia; Canada; coronavirus disease 2019; England; forecasting; France; Greece; human; Italy; journalism; mortality; pandemic; prevalence; priority journal; search engine; South Africa; time series analysis; transfer of learning; United States; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101115156"

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, a major focus of artificial intelligence (AI) is interpreting chest CT, which can be readily used in the assessment and management of the disease. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of a federated learning method for detecting COVID-19 related CT abnormalities with external validation on patients from a multinational study. We recruited 132 patients from seven multinational different centers, with three internal hospitals from Hong Kong for training and testing, and four external, independent datasets from Mainland China and Germany, for validating model generalizability. We also conducted case studies on longitudinal scans for automated estimation of lesion burden for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We explore the federated learning algorithms to develop a privacy-preserving AI model for COVID-19 medical image diagnosis with good generalization capability on unseen multinational datasets. Federated learning could provide an effective mechanism during pandemics to rapidly develop clinically useful AI across institutions and countries overcoming the burden of central aggregation of large amounts of sensitive data. © 2021, The Author(s).","Computerized tomography; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Hospital data processing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensitive data; Data distribution; Lung abnormalities; Machine learning systems; Medical training; Patient data; Privacy mechanisms; Privacy preserving; Scalings; Training database; Validation study; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; artificial intelligence; automation; child; computer assisted tomography; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease burden; feasibility study; female; Germany; ground glass opacity; Hong Kong; hospital patient; human; learning algorithm; lung consolidation; lung disease; major clinical study; male; multicenter study (topic); pandemic; priority journal; privacy; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; validation study; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103580182"

Throughout 2020, over 400,000 coronavirus-related publications have been collected through the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset. Here, we present CO-Search, a semantic, multi-stage, search engine designed to handle complex queries over the COVID-19 literature, potentially aiding overburdened health workers in finding scientific answers and avoiding misinformation during a time of crisis. CO-Search is built from two sequential parts: a hybrid semantic-keyword retriever, which takes an input query and returns a sorted list of the 1000 most relevant documents, and a re-ranker, which further orders them by relevance. The retriever is composed of a deep learning model (Siamese-BERT) that encodes query-level meaning, along with two keyword-based models (BM25, TF-IDF) that emphasize the most important words of a query. The re-ranker assigns a relevance score to each document, computed from the outputs of (1) a question–answering module which gauges how much each document answers the query, and (2) an abstractive summarization module which determines how well a query matches a generated summary of the document. To account for the relatively limited dataset, we develop a text augmentation technique which splits the documents into pairs of paragraphs and the citations contained in them, creating millions of (citation title, paragraph) tuples for training the retriever. We evaluate our system (http://einstein.ai/covid) on the data of the TREC-COVID information retrieval challenge, obtaining strong performance across multiple key information retrieval metrics. © 2021, The Author(s).","Coronavirus; Deep learning; Information retrieval; Search engines; Semantic Web; Semantics; Complex queries; Coronaviruses; Learning models; Multistage search; Question Answering; Relevant documents; Scientific discipline; Semantic search; Time of crisis; Workers'; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; health care personnel; information retrieval; misinformation; priority journal; questionnaire; scoring system; search engine; semantics; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104234111"

This scoping review aims to synthesize the emerging field of mobile health app quality assessment by reviewing criteria used by previous studies to assess the quality of mobile apps for chronic disease management. A literature review was conducted in September 2017 for published studies that use a set of quality criteria to directly evaluate two or more patient-facing apps supporting promote chronic disease management. This resulted in 8182 citations which were reviewed by research team members, resulting in 65 articles for inclusion. An inductive coding schema to synthesize the quality criteria utilized by included articles was developed, with 40 unique quality criteria identified. Of the 43 (66%) articles that reported resources used to support criteria selection, 19 (29%) used clinical guidelines, and 10 (15%) used behavior change theory. The most commonly used criteria included the presence of user engagement or behavior change functions (97%, n = 63) and technical features of the app such as customizability (20%, n = 13, while Usability was assessed by 24 studies (36.9%). This study highlights the significant variation in quality criteria employed for the assessment of mobile health apps. Future methods for app evaluation will benefit from approaches that leverage the best evidence regarding the clinical impact and behavior change mechanisms while more directly reflecting patient needs when evaluating the quality of apps. © 2021, The Author(s).","Behavioral research; mHealth; Quality control; Behaviour changes; Chronic disease; Chronic disease management; Literature reviews; Mobile app; Mobile applications; Quality assessment; Quality criteria; Rapid growth; Scoping review; behavior change; behavior change theory; behavior theory; chronic disease; citation analysis; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; coding; disease management; evidence based medicine; field study; health care need; human; information dissemination; medical information; methodology; patient education; practice guideline; priority journal; quality control; Review; scoping review; stakeholder engagement; Diseases","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102346727"

Moving toward a rapid learning system to solve intractable problems in health demands a balance between protecting patients and making data available to improve health and health care. Public concerns in the U.S. about privacy and the potential for unethical or harmful uses of this data, if not proactively addressed, could upset this balance. New federal laws prioritize sharing health data, including with patient digital tools. U.S. health privacy laws do not cover data collected by many consumer digital technologies and have not been updated to address concerns about the entry of large technology companies into health care. Further, there is increasing recognition that many classes of data not traditionally considered to be healthcare-related, for example consumer credit histories, are indeed predictive of health status and outcomes. We propose a multi-pronged approach to protecting health-relevant data while promoting and supporting beneficial uses and disclosures to improve health and health care for individuals and populations. Such protections should apply to entities collecting health-relevant data regardless of whether they are covered by federal health privacy laws. We focus largely on privacy but also address protections against harms as a critical component of a comprehensive approach to governing health-relevant data. U.S. policymakers and regulators should consider these recommendations in crafting privacy bills and rules. However, our recommendations also can inform best practices even in the absence of new federal requirements. © 2021, The Author(s).","Data privacy; E-learning; Health care; Learning systems; Population statistics; Care process; Digital datas; Health systems; Healthcare systems; National academies; Privacy law; Privacy protection; Public concern; Rapid learning; Reference data; adult; consumer; drug abuse; health status; human; learning health system; privacy; review; Digital devices","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098998069"

Objective measurements of nighttime scratching and sleep quantity can help assess the efficacy of an intervention. Wearable sensors can provide novel, objective measures of nighttime scratching and sleep; however, many current approaches were not designed for passive, unsupervised monitoring during daily life. In this work, we present the development and analytical validation of a method that sequentially processes epochs of sample-level accelerometer data from a wrist-worn device to provide continuous digital measures of nighttime scratching and sleep quantity. This approach uses heuristic and machine learning algorithms in a hierarchical paradigm by first determining when the patient intends to sleep, then detecting sleep–wake states along with scratching episodes, and lastly deriving objective measures of both sleep and scratch. Leveraging reference data collected in a sleep laboratory (NCT ID: NCT03490877), results show that sensor-derived measures of total sleep opportunity (TSO; time when patient intends to sleep) and total sleep time (TST) correlate well with reference polysomnography data (TSO: r = 0.72, p < 0.001; TST: r = 0.76, p < 0.001; N = 32). Log transformed sensor derived measures of total scratching duration achieve strong agreement with reference annotated video recordings (r = 0.82, p < 0.001; N = 25). These results support the use of wearable sensors for objective, continuous measurement of nighttime scratching and sleep during daily life. © 2021, The Author(s).","Digital devices; Heuristic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Sleep research; Video recording; 'current; Atopic dermatitis; Daily lives; Measurements of; Objective measure; Objective measurement; Quality of life; Sleep disturbances; Sleep time; Wearable devices; adult; Article; atopic dermatitis; classifier; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; digital technology; feature detection; female; hand movement; human; laboratory; learning algorithm; machine learning; male; night sleep; polysomnography; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; scratching; sensitivity and specificity; skin pruritus; sleep latency; sleep time; sleep waking cycle; validation study; videorecording; wrist; Wearable sensors","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102009187"

Despite the critical role of data in informing this debate, accurate and comprehensive data on firearm sales and ownership is not readily available. In this study, we evaluate the potential of using firearm-related internet search queries as a complementary, freely available, and near-real-time data source for tracking firearm sales and ownership that enables analysis at finer geographic and temporal scales. (Here, we examine data by state and by month to compare with other data sources, but search engine volume can be analyzed by city and by the week or by day). We validate search query volume against available data on background checks in all 50 US states, and find that they are highly correlated over time (Pearson’s r = 0.96, Spearman’s ρ = 0.94) and space (Pearson’s r = 0.78, Spearman’s ρ = 0.76). We find that stratifying this analysis by gun type (long-gun vs. handgun) increases this correlation dramatically, across both time and space. We also find a positive association between firearm-related search query volume and firearm-related mortality (Pearson’s r = 0.87, Spearman’s ρ = 0.90), and a negative association with the strength of state-level firearm control policies (Pearson’s r = −0.82, Spearman’s ρ = −0.83). Based on these findings, we propose a framework for prospective surveillance that incorporates firearm-related internet search volume as a useful complementary data source to inform the public health policy debate on this issue. © 2020, The Author(s).","Information retrieval; Public health; Search engines; Data-source; Geographics; Internet searches; Near real-time datum; Near-real-time data; Policy debates; Sales policies; Search patterns; Search queries; Temporal scale; article; controlled study; firearm; human; Internet; mortality; prospective study; public health; search engine; Sales","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096335558"

The role of digital interventions to support self-management in improving outcomes is uncertain. We conducted an open, randomised controlled trial of a digital health platform application (app) in 41 COPD patients recruited following hospital admission with an acute exacerbation. Subjects were randomised to either receive usual care, including a written self-management plan (n = 21), or the myCOPD app (n = 20) for 90 days. The primary efficacy outcome was recovery rate of symptoms measured by COPD assessment test (CAT) score. Exacerbations, readmission, inhaler technique quality of life and patient activation (PAM) scores were also captured by a blinded team. The app was acceptable in this care setting and was used by 17 of the 20 patients with sustained use over the study period. The treatment effect on the CAT score was 4.49 (95% CI: −8.41, −0.58) points lower in the myCOPD arm. Patients’ inhaler technique improved in the digital intervention arm (101 improving to 20 critical errors) compared to usual care (100 to 72 critical errors). Exacerbations tended to be less frequent in the digital arm compared to usual care; 34 vs 18 events. Hospital readmissions risk was numerically lower in the digital intervention arm: OR for readmission 0.383 (95% CI: 0.074, 1.987; n = 35). In this feasibility study of the digital self-management platform myCOPD, the app has proven acceptable to patients to use and use has improved exacerbation recovery rates, with strong signals of lower re-exacerbation and readmission rates over 90 days. myCOPD reduced the number of critical errors in inhaler technique compared to usual care with written self-management. This provides a strong basis for further exploration of the use of app interventions in the context of recently hospitalised patients with COPD and informs the potential design of a large multi-centre trial. © 2020, The Author(s).","Errors; Patient treatment; Pulmonary diseases; Acute exacerbations; Be recoveries; E health; Hospital admissions; Management plans; Quality of life; Randomized controlled trial; Recovery rate; Self management; Treatment effects; aged; Article; automation; chronic obstructive lung disease; chronic obstructive lung disease assessment test; clinical article; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; disease exacerbation; feasibility study; female; hospital admission; hospital readmission; human; intermethod comparison; longitudinal study; male; minimal clinically important difference; open study; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; respiratory tract disease assessment; self care; telehealth; treatment outcome; Hospitals","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094658564"

We investigated seasonal and weather effects of sleep duration, bedtime, and wake time. We found several small but statistically significant effects of seasonal and weather effects on sleep patterns. We observe the strongest seasonal effects for wake time and sleep duration, especially during the spring season: wake times are earlier, and sleep duration decreases (compared to the reference season winter). Sleep duration also modestly decreases when day lengths get longer (between the winter and summer solstice).

In healthcare, intelligible models not only help clinicians to understand the problem and create more targeted action plans, but also help to gain the clinicians’ trust. One method of overcoming the limited interpretability of more complex models is to use Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). Standard GAMs simply model the target response as a sum of univariate models. Inspired by GAMs, the same idea can be applied to neural networks through an architecture referred to as Generalized Additive Models with Neural Networks (GAM-NNs). In this manuscript, we present the development and validation of a model applying the concept of GAM-NNs to allow for interpretability by visualizing the learned feature patterns related to risk of in-hospital mortality for patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia. The data consists of 59,985 patients with a feature set of 46 features extracted at the end of surgery to which we added previously not included features: total anesthesia case time (1 feature); the time in minutes spent with mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 mmHg during surgery (6 features); and Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Code Descriptions of the Primary current procedure terminology (CPT) codes (33 features) for a total of 86 features. All data were randomly split into 80% for training (n = 47,988) and 20% for testing (n = 11,997) prior to model development. Model performance was compared to a standard LR model using the same features as the GAM-NN. The data consisted of 59,985 surgical records, and the occurrence of in-hospital mortality was 0.81% in the training set and 0.72% in the testing set. The GAM-NN model with HCUP features had the highest area under the curve (AUC) 0.921 (0.895–0.95). Overall, both GAM-NN models had higher AUCs than LR models, however, had lower average precisions. The LR model without HCUP features had the highest average precision 0.217 (0.136–0.31). To assess the interpretability of the GAM-NNs, we then visualized the learned contributions of the GAM-NNs and compared against the learned contributions of the LRs for the models with HCUP features. Overall, we were able to demonstrate that our proposed generalized additive neural network (GAM-NN) architecture is able to (1) leverage a neural network’s ability to learn nonlinear patterns in the data, which is more clinically intuitive, (2) be interpreted easily, making it more clinically useful, and (3) maintain model performance as compared to previously published DNNs. © 2021, The Author(s).","Additives; Anesthesiology; Codes (symbols); Forecasting; Hospitals; Surgery; Generalized additive model; Health care costs; Healthcare utilization; High-accuracy; Hospital mortality; Interpretability; Logistic Regression modeling; Machine learning models; Modeling performance; Neural-networks; adult; area under the curve; article; controlled study; deep neural network; female; general anesthesia; health care cost; hospital mortality; human; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; nomenclature; prediction; risk assessment; validation process; Deep neural networks","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098969170"

Here we assess whether a deep-learning system for volumetric heart segmentation on computed tomography (CT) scans developed in cardiovascular radiology can optimize treatment planning in radiation oncology. The system was trained using multi-center data (n = 858) with manual heart segmentations provided by cardiovascular radiologists. Validation of the system was performed in an independent real-world dataset of 5677 breast cancer patients treated with radiation therapy at the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center between 2008–2018. In a subset of 20 patients, the performance of the system was compared to eight radiation oncology experts by assessing segmentation time, agreement between experts, and accuracy with and without deep-learning assistance. To compare the performance to segmentations used in the clinic, concordance and failures (defined as Dice < 0.85) of the system were evaluated in the entire dataset. The system was successfully applied without retraining. With deep-learning assistance, segmentation time significantly decreased (4.0 min [IQR 3.1–5.0] vs. 2.0 min [IQR 1.3–3.5]; p < 0.001), and agreement increased (Dice 0.95 [IQR = 0.02]; vs. 0.97 [IQR = 0.02], p < 0.001). Expert accuracy was similar with and without deep-learning assistance (Dice 0.92 [IQR = 0.02] vs. 0.92 [IQR = 0.02]; p = 0.48), and not significantly different from deep-learning-only segmentations (Dice 0.92 [IQR = 0.02]; p ≥ 0.1).

The methodological errors are described in detail below. For transparency, the original figures and table have not been updated in the original version. Additionally, the contact details for Marco Prunotto have changed since publication and have been updated accordingly. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUE In the first modeling step, deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNNs), also called in this context “pillars”, are trained for each field of view (FOV) of the color fundus photographs (CFPs). During the training of each individual CNN, a grid search approach with a 5-fold cross-validation (CV) scheme is used to find the optimal tuple of learning rate for the transfer learning and for the fine tuning phase. Given a tuple of learning rates and a split of 4 folds for training and 1 fold for testing, training is stopped at the epoch when the area under the curve (AUC) peaks with respect to the fold left for testing. The weights of each CNN are therefore decided on the basis of the “testing” folds, which, in reality, is playing the role of a parameter tuning fold. As a consequence, the performance of the pillars, reported in terms of mean AUC and its standard deviation over the 5 folds, is over optimistic due to the CNNs overfitting the “test folds” at each round of the CV scheme. The overfitting cascades into the second modeling step involving random forest that leverage as input the probabilities produced by the trained CNNs. METHODOLOGICAL AMENDMENT In this amended re-run of the modeling work, we maintain the grid search approach of looking for the optimal tuple of learning rates (one for transfer learning, the other for fine tuning) and the strategy of saving the weights of a CNN at the epoch where the AUC computed on the tuning set reaches the maximum value. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows the nested 5-fold CV scheme adopted for this amended re-run of the modeling work. Given a tuple of learning rates, a fold is selected to be the test or hold-out set, i.e., kept unseen during training, at each of the 5 CV iterations. This leaves 4 folds to be used for training and hyper-parameter tuning. At this point, 4 CNNs are created by rotating each time the fold used for hyper-parameter tuning and the triplet used for training. This results in a total of 20 CNNs trained for each tuple of learning rates. Once the grid search is completed, the 5 CNNs with highest tuning AUC are selected for a given FOV, fold and split of the training/ tuning set. Selecting more than 1 CNN allows the creation of a more populated ensemble scheme, where there are multiple DL models expressing an “opinion” on the DR progression of the given CFP. The procedure is applied to each of the 7 CFP FOVs. At this point, the first modeling step is concluded. In the second modeling step, the trained CNNs are executed on the respective training and tuning sets to generate the input probabilities to train the random forest (RF) model. The training, tuning, and testing folds used to perform the RF model are the same used throughout the entire modeling work. A grid search approach is used to find the optimal RF hyper-parameters. In particular, the grid search looks for the optimal combination of the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node, the number of trees, whether the best splitting criterion is provided by the Gini or the entropy index, the maximum number of features to consider when looking for the best split, and the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. Among all these RF instances, for a given fold and split of the training/tuning sets, the RF model with the highest tuning AUC is selected. Therefore, the final RF aggregation entails 20 distinct RF instances. These RF instances are applied to the corresponding hold-out set and the probability vectors generated for the same hold-out by the 4 different RF instances are averaged together. With this final probability vector, the testing AUC, sensitivity (SENS), and specificity (SPEC) can be computed for the selected fold. The process is then repeated over the 5 folds leading to the mean values and the corresponding standard deviations of the aforementioned metrics that are reported in Supplementary Table 1. Sensitivity and specificity are evaluated at Youden’s point, as specified in the manuscript. The probabilities of the RF models sharing the same hold-out fold are averaged together before computing the corresponding testing metrics. Supplementary Table 1 summarizes the modeling results and allows to quantify the difference with the results produced by the faulty methodology and reported by the published manuscript. Once the described source of overfitting is removed from the modeling procedure, the AUC drops substantially, by a value of 0.1 approximately. The main consequence is that the overall predictive power that can be harvested for DR progression from baseline CFPs is considerably inferior than what was claimed on the basis of the previous faulty results. SECONDARY ANALYSIS Comparison between single-FOV and 7-FOV aggregation Table 1 reports the performance of the individual FOV-specific CNNs (100 CNNs for each FOV, 5 repetitions × 5 folds × 4 splits training/tuning) when applied to the hold-out folds. The final row of Table 1 shows the pooled mean AUC and standard deviation across the 7 FOVs for the months. The performance of the RF aggregation reported by Supplementary Table 1 is not statistically significant when compared to the pooled mean AUC of Table 1 (p value=0.300 for month 6, p value= 0.227 for month 12, p value=0.610 for month 24). The correct version of Table 1 appears below. (Table presented.). Comparison between central and peripheral fields Supplementary Table 2 reports the performance of the RF aggregation using as input only the central fields F1 and F2. From these results, we can see that the 7-FOV RF aggregation (Supplementary Table 1) improves the model performance compared to leveraging only the central fields, but not in a statistically significantly way (p value for month 6 not needed as the AUC < 0.5, p value = 0.098 for month 12, p value = 0.194 for month 24). Figure 3 displays the recomputed pointwise SHAP plots for the 7-FOV RF aggregation, further confirming the fact that the peripheral fields play an important role in the overall prediction. (Figure presented.). ATTRIBUTION MAPS The recomputed attribution maps of samples drawn from the hold-out sets do not present any qualitative difference with respect to those computed with the faulty methodology. Some examples for each month and FOV type are displayed in Fig. 4, as it was done in the original manuscript. (Figure presented.).

Sleep staging segments a period of sleep into a sequence of phases providing the basis for most clinical decisions in sleep medicine. Manual sleep staging is difficult and time-consuming as experts must evaluate hours of polysomnography (PSG) recordings with electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) data for each patient. Here, we present U-Sleep, a publicly available, ready-to-use deep-learning-based system for automated sleep staging (sleep.ai.ku.dk). U-Sleep is a fully convolutional neural network, which was trained and evaluated on PSG recordings from 15,660 participants of 16 clinical studies. It provides accurate segmentations across a wide range of patient cohorts and PSG protocols not considered when building the system. U-Sleep works for arbitrary combinations of typical EEG and EOG channels, and its special deep learning architecture can label sleep stages at shorter intervals than the typical 30 s periods used during training. We show that these labels can provide additional diagnostic information and lead to new ways of analyzing sleep. U-Sleep performs on par with state-of-the-art automatic sleep staging systems on multiple clinical datasets, even if the other systems were built specifically for the particular data. A comparison with consensus-scores from a previously unseen clinic shows that U-Sleep performs as accurately as the best of the human experts. U-Sleep can support the sleep staging workflow of medical experts, which decreases healthcare costs, and can provide highly accurate segmentations when human expertize is lacking. © 2021, The Author(s).","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Electrophysiology; Sleep research; Clinical decision; Clinical study; Convolutional neural network; Global population; High frequency HF; Learning architectures; Polysomnography; Ready to use; Sleep disorders; Sleep staging; adult; article; cohort analysis; consensus; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; electroencephalography; electrooculography; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; medical expert; polysomnography; sleep stage; workflow; Electroencephalography","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104512326"

Less is known about their robustness against real-world variations, and clinicians may incorrectly assume that a model with an acceptable area under the receiver operating characteristic curve or related performance metric is ready for clinical use. Here, we systematically assessed the performance of dermatologist-level convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on real-world non-curated images by applying computational “stress tests”. Our goal was to create a proxy environment in which to comprehensively test the generalizability of off-the-shelf CNNs developed without training or evaluation protocols specific to individual clinics.

We sought to determine whether Internet search patterns can be useful for tracking COVID-19 spread, and whether these data could also be useful in understanding the clinical progression of the disease in 32 countries across six continents. Temporal correlation analyses were conducted to characterize the relationships between a range of COVID-19 symptom-specific search terms and reported COVID-19 cases and deaths for each country from January 1 through April 20, 2020. Increases in COVID-19 symptom-related searches preceded increases in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths by an average of 18.53 days (95% CI 15.98–21.08) and 22.16 days (20.33–23.99), respectively. Cross-country ensemble averaging was used to derive average temporal profiles for each search term, which were combined to create a search-data-based view of the clinical course of disease progression. Internet search patterns revealed a clear temporal pattern of disease progression for COVID-19: Initial symptoms of fever, dry cough, sore throat and chills were followed by shortness of breath an average of 5.22 days (3.30–7.14) after initial symptom onset, matching the clinical course reported in the medical literature. This study shows that Internet search data can be useful for characterizing the detailed clinical course of a disease. These data are available in real-time at population scale, providing important benefits as a complementary resource for tracking pandemics, especially before widespread laboratory testing is available. © 2021, The Author(s).","Curricula; Information retrieval; Population statistics; Search engines; Clinical course; Correlation analysis; Disease progression; Ensemble averaging; Health response; Internet searches; Search patterns; Search terms; Temporal correlations; Temporal profile; Africa; Article; Asia; chill; coronavirus disease 2019; correlation analysis; disease course; disease exacerbation; disease surveillance; disease transmission; dry cough; dyspnea; Europe; fever; geography; human; Internet; mortality; North America; Pacific islands; pandemic; priority journal; sore throat; South America; symptom; temporal analysis; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101141204"

Although cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) is an essential examination for noninvasive estimation of ventilatory threshold (VT), defined as the clinically equivalent to aerobic exercise, its evaluation requires an expensive respiratory gas analyzer and expertize. To address these inconveniences, this study investigated the feasibility of a deep learning (DL) algorithm with single-lead electrocardiography (ECG) for estimating the aerobic exercise threshold. Two hundred sixty consecutive patients with CVDs who underwent CPX were analyzed. Single-lead ECG data were stored as time-series voltage data with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The data of preprocessed ECG and time point at VT calculated by respiratory gas analyzer were used to train a neural network. The trained model was applied on an independent test cohort, and the DL threshold (DLT; a time of VT estimated through the DL algorithm) was calculated. We compared the correlation between oxygen uptake of the VT (VT–VO2) and the DLT (DLT–VO2). Our DL model showed that the DLT–VO2 was confirmed to be significantly correlated with the VT–VO2 (r = 0.875; P < 0.001), and the mean difference was nonsignificant (−0.05 ml/kg/min, P > 0.05), which displayed strong agreements between the VT and the DLT. The DL algorithm using single-lead ECG data enabled accurate estimation of VT in patients with CVDs. The DL algorithm may be a novel way for estimating aerobic exercise threshold. © 2020, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Learning systems; Vanadium dioxide; Aerobic exercise; Cardiovascular disease; Gas analyzers; Health status; ITS evaluation; Learning methods; Noninvasive estimation; Physical activity; Times series; Ventilatory thresholds; adult; aerobic exercise; Article; artificial neural network; cardiopulmonary exercise test; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; comparative study; convolution algorithm; correlation coefficient; deep learning; electrocardiography; feasibility study; female; human; long short term memory network; major clinical study; male; middle aged; one dimensional convolution; one dimensional max pooling; oxygen consumption; priority journal; respiratory tract parameters; ventilatory threshold; Electrocardiography","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094649399"

Combining computational methods and clinical expertise, we curated clusters that represent 46 clinical conditions as potential risk factors for death after a COVID-19 infection. We trained age-stratified generalized linear models (GLMs) with component-wise gradient boosting to predict the probability of death based on what we know from the patients before they contracted the virus. Despite only relying on previously documented demographics and comorbidities, our models demonstrated similar performance to other prognostic models that require an assortment of symptoms, laboratory values, and images at the time of diagnosis or during the course of the illness. In general, we found age as the most important predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients. A history of pneumonia, which is rarely asked in typical epidemiology studies, was one of the most important risk factors for predicting COVID-19 mortality. A history of diabetes with complications and cancer (breast and prostate) were notable risk factors for patients between the ages of 45 and 65 years. In patients aged 65–85 years, diseases that affect the pulmonary system, including interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and a smoking history, were important for predicting mortality. The ability to compute precise individual-level risk scores exclusively based on the EHR is crucial for effectively allocating and distributing resources, such as prioritizing vaccination among the general population. © 2021, The Author(s).","Biological organs; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Health risks; Medical computing; Pulmonary diseases; Viruses; levothyroxine; Age groups; Clinical conditions; Component wise; Electronic health; Generalized linear model; Health records; Medical information; Medical record; Potential risks; Risk factors; abdominal aortic aneurysm; adult; age; aged; algorithm; anemia; aortic valve disease; Article; atrial fibrillation; breast cancer; cardiomegaly; carotid artery obstruction; cerebrovascular accident; chronic kidney failure; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; controlled study; coronary artery disease; coronavirus disease 2019; death; depression; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic value; disease course; diverticulosis; electronic medical record; end stage renal disease; epilepsy; female; gastroesophageal reflux; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; gout; heart atrium flutter; heart failure; heart ventricle tachycardia; human; hyperlipidemia; hyperparathyroidism; hypertension; hypothyroidism; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; interstitial lung disease; lung cancer; lung embolism; lung tumor; major clinical study; male; medical history; medical information; mitral valve disease; mortality; mortality risk; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; osteoarthritis; Parkinson disease; peripheral vascular disease; pneumonia; prediction; priority journal; prostate cancer; prostate hypertrophy; prostate tumor; pulmonary hypertension; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor; sleep disordered breathing; smoking; thoracic aorta aneurysm; tricuspid valve disease; urinary tract infection; very elderly; vitamin D deficiency; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100499091"

The UK National Health Service (NHS) Track and Trace Service has plans for a nationwide app that notifies the need for self-isolation to those in contact with a person testing positive for COVID-19. To be successful, such an app will require high uptake, the determinants and willingness for which are unclear but essential to understand for effective public health benefit. The objective of this study was to measure the determinants of willingness to participate in an NHS app-based contact-tracing programme using a questionnaire within the Care Information Exchange (CIE)—the largest patient-facing electronic health record in the NHS. Among 47,708 registered NHS users of the CIE, 27% completed a questionnaire asking about willingness to participate in app-based contact tracing, understanding of government advice, mental and physical wellbeing and their healthcare utilisation—related or not to COVID-19. Descriptive statistics are reported alongside univariate and multivariable logistic regression models, with positive or negative responses to a question on app-based contact tracing as the dependent variable. 26.1% of all CIE participants were included in the analysis (N = 12,434, 43.0% male, mean age 55.2). 60.3% of respondents were willing to participate in app-based contact tracing. Out of those who responded ‘no’, 67.2% stated that this was due to privacy concerns. In univariate analysis, worsening mood, fear and anxiety in relation to changes in government rules around lockdown were associated with lower willingness to participate. Multivariable analysis showed that difficulty understanding government rules was associated with a decreased inclination to download the app, with those scoring 1–2 and 3–4 in their understanding of the new government rules being 45% and 27% less inclined to download the contact-tracing app, respectively; when compared to those who rated their understanding as 5–6/10 (OR for 1–2/10 = 0.57 [CI 0.48–0.67]; OR for 3–4/10 = 0.744 [CI 0.64–0.87]), whereas scores of 7–8 and 9–10 showed a 43% and 31% respective increase. Those reporting an unconfirmed belief of having previously had and recovered from COVID-19 were 27% less likely to be willing to download the app; belief of previous recovery from COVID-19 infection OR 0.727 [0.585–0.908]). In this large UK-wide questionnaire of wellbeing in lockdown, a willingness for app-based contact tracing over an appropriate age range is 60%—close to the estimated 56% population uptake, and substantially less than the smartphone-user uptake considered necessary for an app-based contact tracing to be an effective intervention to help suppress an epidemic. Difficulty comprehending government advice and uncertainty of diagnosis, based on a public health policy of not testing to confirm self-reported COVID-19 infection during lockdown, therefore reduce willingness to adopt a government contact-tracing app to a level below the threshold for effectiveness as a tool to suppress an epidemic. © 2020, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Regression analysis; Contact tracing; Coronaviruses; Electronic health; Health benefits; Health policy; Health records; Information exchanges; National health services; Track and Trace; Wellbeing; adult; anxiety; Article; contact examination; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; dependent variable; electronic health record; female; government; health care utilization; human; lockdown; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mood; national health service; physical well-being; priority journal; privacy; questionnaire; remission; uncertainty; univariate analysis; Surveys","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100059564"

We trained deep learning models using only clinician-initiated, administrative data for 42.9 million admissions using three subsets of data: demographic data only, demographic data and information available at admission, and the previous data plus charges recorded during the first day of admission. Models trained on charges during the first day of admission achieve performance close to published full EMR-based benchmarks for inpatient outcomes: inhospital mortality (0.89 AUC), prolonged length of stay (0.82 AUC), and 30-day readmission rate (0.71 AUC). Similar performance between models trained with only clinician-initiated data and those trained with full EMR data purporting to include information about patient state and physiology should raise concern in the deployment of these models. Furthermore, these models exhibited significant declines in performance when evaluated over only myocardial infarction (MI) patients relative to models trained over MI patients alone, highlighting the importance of physician diagnosis in the prognostic performance of these models. These results provide a benchmark for predictive accuracy trained only on prior clinical actions and indicate that models with similar performance may derive their signal by looking over clinician’s shoulders—using clinical behavior as the expression of preexisting intuition and suspicion to generate a prediction.

This retrospective, multicenter study, evaluated 165 patients with brain metastases. The proposed input-level dropout (ILD) model was trained on multisequence MRI from 100 patients and validated/tested on 10/55 patients, in which the test set was missing one of the four MRI sequences used for training. The segmentation results were compared with the performance of a state-of-the-art DeepLab V3 model. The MR sequences in the training set included pre-gadolinium and post-gadolinium (Gd) T1-weighted 3D fast spin echo, post-Gd T1-weighted inversion recovery (IR) prepped fast spoiled gradient echo, and 3D fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), whereas the test set did not include the IR prepped image-series. The ground truth segmentations were established by experienced neuroradiologists. The results were evaluated using precision, recall, Intersection over union (IoU)-score and Dice score, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve statistics, while the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the performance of the two neural networks. The area under the ROC curve (AUC), averaged across all test cases, was 0.989 ± 0.029 for the ILD-model and 0.989 ± 0.023 for the DeepLab V3 model (p = 0.62). The ILD-model showed a significantly higher Dice score (0.795 ± 0.104 vs. 0.774 ± 0.104, p = 0.017), and IoU-score (0.561 ± 0.225 vs. 0.492 ± 0.186, p < 0.001) compared to the DeepLab V3 model, and a significantly lower average false positive rate of 3.6/patient vs. 7.0/patient (p < 0.001) using a 10 mm3 lesion-size limit. The ILD-model, trained on all possible combinations of four MRI sequences, may facilitate accurate detection and segmentation of brain metastases on a multicenter basis, even when the test cohort is missing input MRI sequences. © 2021, The Author(s).","Brain; Computer system recovery; Deep learning; Gadolinium; Image segmentation; Multilayer neural networks; Pathology; gadobenate dimeglumine; Brain metastasis; Gadolinia; Inversion recovery; MRI sequences; Multi-centre study; Neural-networks; Performance; Receiver operating characteristic curves; T1-weighted; Test sets; adult; aged; Article; brain metastasis; controlled study; deep learning; female; health care; human; image segmentation; major clinical study; male; measurement accuracy; multicenter study; neuroradiologist; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; rank sum test; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; Magnetic resonance imaging","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101373055"

We conducted a systematic scoping review in accordance with the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews to consolidate and characterize the existing research on DPHS and identify areas for further research. We used Natural Language Processing and content analysis to define the search strings and searched Global Health, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar from 2005 to January 2020 for peer-reviewed articles on DPHS, with extensive hand searching. Seven hundred fifty-five articles were included in this review. The studies were from 54 countries and utilized 26 digital platforms to study 208 sub-categories of 49 categories associated with 16 public health surveillance (PHS) themes. Most studies were conducted by researchers from the United States (56%, 426) and dominated by communicable diseases-related topics (25%, 187), followed by behavioural risk factors (17%, 131). While this review discusses the potentials of using Internet-based data as an affordable and instantaneous resource for DPHS, it highlights the paucity of longitudinal studies and the methodological and inherent practical limitations underpinning the successful implementation of a DPHS system. Little work studied Internet users’ demographics when developing DPHS systems, and 39% (291) of studies did not stratify their results by geographic region. A clear methodology by which the results of DPHS can be linked to public health action has yet to be established, as only six (0.8%) studies deployed their system into a PHS context. © 2021, The Author(s).","Monitoring; Natural language processing systems; 4' methylmethcathinone; alcohol; amphetamine plus dexamphetamine; androgen; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; anticoagulant agent; antidepressant agent; antiinfective agent; antiretrovirus agent; atorvastatin; bisphosphonic acid derivative; codeine; fentanyl; glucocorticoid; heparinoid; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; illicit drug; influenza vaccine; loperamide; measles vaccine; medical cannabis; opiate; poliomyelitis vaccine; recreational drug; Rotavirus vaccine; sitagliptin; vaccine; varicella zoster vaccine; Wart virus vaccine; zolpidem; Accessible information; Content analysis; Global health; Language content; Language processing; Natural languages; Public health surveillance systems; Public health surveillances; Scoping review; Web of Science; adult; alternative medicine; antimicrobial stewardship; anxiety disorder; automutilation; behavioral risk factor surveillance system; bipolar depression; child; chronic disease; communicable disease; content analysis; digital technology; drug safety; drug utilization; eating disorder; health care policy; health survey; human; influenza vaccination; information seeking; longitudinal study; measles vaccination; medical technology; mortality; natural language processing; nursing home; postmarketing surveillance; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; priority journal; public health surveillance; Review; smoking; social media; suicide; suicide attempt; systematic review; unspecified side effect; vaccination; web-based intervention; young adult; Public health","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102008609"

Most individuals with FH remain undiagnosed, precluding opportunities to prevent premature heart disease and death. Some machine-learning approaches improve detection of FH in electronic health records, though clinical impact is under-explored. We assessed performance of an array of machine-learning approaches for enhancing detection of FH, and their clinical utility, within a large primary care population. A retrospective cohort study was done using routine primary care clinical records of 4,027,775 individuals from the United Kingdom with total cholesterol measured from 1 January 1999 to 25 June 2019. Predictive accuracy of five common machine-learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting machines, neural networks and ensemble learning) were assessed for detecting FH. Predictive accuracy was assessed by area under the receiver operating curves (AUC) and expected vs observed calibration slope; with clinical utility assessed by expected case-review workload and likelihood ratios. There were 7928 incident diagnoses of FH. In addition to known clinical features of FH (raised total cholesterol or LDL-C and family history of premature coronary heart disease), machine-learning (ML) algorithms identified features such as raised triglycerides which reduced the likelihood of FH. Apart from logistic regression (AUC, 0.81), all four other ML approaches had similarly high predictive accuracy (AUC > 0.89). Calibration slope ranged from 0.997 for gradient boosting machines to 1.857 for logistic regression. Among those screened, high probability cases requiring clinical review varied from 0.73% using ensemble learning to 10.16% using deep learning, but with positive predictive values of 15.5% and 2.8% respectively. Ensemble learning exhibited a dominant positive likelihood ratio (45.5) compared to all other ML models (7.0–14.4). Machine-learning models show similar high accuracy in detecting FH, offering opportunities to increase diagnosis. However, the clinical case-finding workload required for yield of cases will differ substantially between models. © 2020, The Author(s).","Adaptive boosting; Cholesterol; Decision trees; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Heart; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Supervised learning; cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; Clinical utility; Ensemble learning; Familial hypercholesterolemia; Lipoprotein cholesterol; Logistics regressions; Low density lipoproteins; Machine learning approaches; Predictive accuracy; Primary care; Total cholesterols; adult; area under the curve; Article; artificial neural network; calibration; cholesterol blood level; clinical assessment; clinical feature; cohort analysis; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; electronic health record; electronic medical record; ensemble learning; familial hypercholesterolemia; family history; feature extraction; female; human; incidence; ischemic heart disease; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; male; potential difference; predictive value; primary medical care; priority journal; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; supervised machine learning; United Kingdom; workload; Calibration","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094681913"

We designed a portable and scalable electronic CKD phenotype to facilitate early disease recognition and empower large-scale observational and genetic studies of kidney traits. The algorithm uses a combination of rule-based and machine-learning methods to automatically place patients on the staging grid of albuminuria by glomerular filtration rate (“A-by-G” grid). We manually validated the algorithm by 451 chart reviews across three medical systems, demonstrating overall positive predictive value of 95% for CKD cases and 97% for healthy controls.

In this article, we provide an overview of different approaches to uncertainty quantification and abstention for machine learning and highlight how these techniques could improve the safety and reliability of current ML systems being used in healthcare settings. Effective quantification and communication of uncertainty could help to engender trust with healthcare workers, while providing safeguards against known failure modes of current machine learning approaches.

We developed a smartphone adaptation of the cognitive test, the Symbol-Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) by randomizing the test’s symbol-number codes and testing sequences. The smartphone SDMT showed comparable psychometric properties in 154 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 39 healthy volunteers (HV). E.g., smartphone SDMT achieved slightly higher correlations with cognitive subscores of neurological examinations and with brain injury measured by MRI (R2 = 0.75, Rho = 0.83, p < 0.0001) than traditional SDMT. Mathematical adjustment for motoric disability of the dominant hand, measured by another smartphone test, compensates for the disadvantage of touch-based test.

One of the intended effects of these NPIs has been to reduce population mobility. Due to the huge costs of implementing these NPIs, it is essential to have a good understanding of their efficacy. Using aggregated mobility data per country, released by Apple and Google we investigated the proportional contribution of NPIs to the magnitude and rate of mobility changes at a multi-national level. NPIs with the greatest impact on the magnitude of mobility change were lockdown measures; declaring a state of emergency; closure of businesses and public services and school closures. NPIs with the greatest effect on the rate of mobility change were implementation of lockdown measures and limitation of public gatherings. As confirmed by chi-square and cluster analysis, separately recorded NPIs like school closure and closure of businesses and public services were closely correlated with each other, both in timing and occurrence. This suggests that the observed significant NPI effects are mixed with and amplified by their correlated NPI measures. We observed direct and similar effects of NPIs on both Apple and Google mobility data. In addition, although Apple and Google data were obtained by different methods they were strongly correlated indicating that they are reflecting overall mobility on a country level. The availability of this data provides an opportunity for governments to build timely, uniform and cost-effective mechanisms to monitor COVID-19 or future pandemic countermeasures. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cluster analysis; Cost effectiveness; Emergency services; Fruits; Business service; Global mobility; Google+; Mobility changes; Mobility datum; Multi-nationals; National level; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; Public services; State of emergency; Article; cluster analysis; commercial phenomena; coronavirus disease 2019; emergency; global health; government; human; lockdown; pandemic; priority journal; public health; South Africa; Spain; Sweden; United Arab Emirates; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105810110"

To address this gap, we assessed sleep with a wearable device, daily mood with a smartphone application and depression through the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) over the demanding first year of physician training (internship). In 2115 interns, reduced TST (b = −0.11, p < 0.001), later bedtime (b = 0.068, p = 0.015), along with increased variability in TST (b = 0.4, p = 0.0012) and in wake time (b = 0.081, p = 0.005) were associated with more depressive symptoms. Overall, the aggregated impact of sleep variability parameters and of mean sleep parameters on PHQ-9 were similar in magnitude (both r2 = 0.01). Within individuals, increased TST (b = 0.06, p < 0.001), later wake time (b = 0.09, p < 0.001), earlier bedtime (b = − 0.07, p < 0.001), as well as lower day-to-day shifts in TST (b = −0.011, p < 0.001) and in wake time (b = −0.004, p < 0.001) were associated with improved next-day mood.

Early and accurate diagnosis of Covid-19 is crucial in reducing the spread of the disease and its accompanied mortality. Currently, detection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard of outpatient and inpatient detection of Covid-19. RT-PCR is a rapid method; however, its accuracy in detection is only ~70–75%. Another approved strategy is computed tomography (CT) imaging. CT imaging has a much higher sensitivity of ~80–98%, but similar accuracy of 70%. To enhance the accuracy of CT imaging detection, we developed an open-source framework, CovidCTNet, composed of a set of deep learning algorithms that accurately differentiates Covid-19 from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other lung diseases. CovidCTNet increases the accuracy of CT imaging detection to 95% compared to radiologists (70%). CovidCTNet is designed to work with heterogeneous and small sample sizes independent of the CT imaging hardware. To facilitate the detection of Covid-19 globally and assist radiologists and physicians in the screening process, we are releasing all algorithms and model parameter details as open-source. Open-source sharing of CovidCTNet enables developers to rapidly improve and optimize services while preserving user privacy and data ownership. © 2021, The Author(s).","Computerized tomography; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Learning algorithms; Open source software; Polymerase chain reaction; Computed tomography images; Gold standards; High sensitivity; Imaging detections; Learning approach; Open source frameworks; Open-source; Rapid method; Reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction; Tomography imaging; Article; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; community acquired pneumonia; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic error; diagnostic radiologist; diagnostic test accuracy study; differential diagnosis; human; image reconstruction; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; thorax radiography; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101281264"

In parallel, deep learning algorithms have been developed to detect radiological findings in chest X-rays (CXRs). However, the feasibility of using smartphones to automate this process has yet to be evaluated. This study developed a recalibration method to build deep learning models to detect radiological findings on CXR photographs. Two publicly available databases (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert) were used to build the models, and four derivative datasets containing 6453 CXR photographs were collected to evaluate model performance. After recalibration, the model achieved areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.78–0.82), 0.88 (0.86–0.90), 0.81 (0.79–0.84), 0.79 (0.77–0.81), 0.84 (0.80–0.88), and 0.90 (0.88–0.92), respectively, for detecting cardiomegaly, edema, consolidation, atelectasis, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion. The recalibration strategy, respectively, recovered 84.9%, 83.5%, 53.2%, 57.8%, 69.9%, and 83.0% of performance losses of the uncalibrated model. We conclude that the recalibration method can transfer models from digital CXRs to CXR photographs, which is expected to help physicians’ clinical works. © 2021, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Photography; Abnormality detection; Chest radiographs; Image-based; Learning models; Modeling performance; Radiological findings; Recalibrations; Smart phones; Teleconsultation; X ray photograph; Article; atelectasis; cardiomegaly; deep learning; human; lung consolidation; lung edema; pleura effusion; pneumothorax; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; thorax radiography; Smartphones","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101479013"

Prior to the epidemic (2019), the American Medical Association (AMA) conducted a routine study to compare physicians’ adoption of emerging technologies to a similar survey in 2016. Most notable was a doubling in the adoption of telehealth/virtual technology to 28% and increases in the use of remote monitoring and management for improved care (13–22%). These results may now seem insignificant when compared to the unprecedented surge in telehealth visits because of SARS-CoV-2. Even as this surge levels off and begins to decline, many observers believe we will continue to see a persistent increase in the use of virtual visits compared to face-to-face care. The requirements for adoption communicated by physicians in both the 2016 and 2019 surveys are now more relevant than ever: Is remote care as effective as in-person care and how best to determine when to use these modalities? How do I safeguard my patients and my practice from liability and privacy concerns? How do I optimize using these technologies in my practice and, especially integration with my EHR and workflows to improve efficiency? And how will a mix of virtual and in-person visits affect practice revenue and sustainability? Consumers have also expressed concerns about payment for virtual visits as well as privacy and quality of care. If telehealth and remote care are here to stay, continuing to track their impact during the current public health emergency is critically important to address so that policymakers and insurers will take necessary steps to ensure that the “new normal” will reflect a health care delivery model that can provide comparable or improved results today and into the future. © 2021, The Author(s).","eHealth; Medical computing; Surveys; American Medical Association; Doublings; Emerging technologies; Face to face; Monitoring and management; Physician adoptions; Remote management; Remote monitoring; Telehealth; Virtual technology; clinical practice; consumer; coronavirus disease 2019; digital technology; health care delivery; health care need; health care policy; health care quality; health insurance; human; medical liability; pandemic; physician; priority journal; privacy; public health; Review; telehealth; virtual reality; Coronavirus","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100955302"

Machine learning (ML)-driven interventions leveraging smart-breathalyzer data may help reduce these harms. We developed a digital phenotype of long-term smart-breathalyzer behavior to predict individuals’ breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) levels trained on data from a smart breathalyzer. We analyzed roughly one million datapoints from 33,452 users of a commercial smart-breathalyzer device, collected between 2013 and 2017. For validation, we analyzed the associations between state-level observed smart-breathalyzer BrAC levels and impaired-driving motor vehicle death rates. Behavioral, geolocation-based, and time-series-derived features were fed to an ML algorithm using training (70% of the cohort), development (10% of the cohort), and test (20% of the cohort) sets to predict the likelihood of a BrAC exceeding the legal driving limit (0.08 g/dL). States with higher average BrAC levels had significantly higher alcohol-related driving death rates, adjusted for the number of users per state B (SE) = 91.38 (15.16), p < 0.01. In the independent test set, the ML algorithm predicted the likelihood of a given user-initiated BrAC sample exceeding BrAC ≥ 0.08 g/dL, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 85%. Highly predictive features included users’ prior BrAC trends, subjective estimation of their BrAC (or AUC = 82% without the self-estimate), engagement and self-monitoring, time since the last measure, and hour of the day. In conclusion, an ML algorithm successfully quantified a digital phenotype of behavior, predicting naturalistic BrAC levels exceeding 0.08 g/dL (a threshold associated with alcohol-related harm) with good discrimination capability. This result establishes a foundation for future research on precision behavioral medicine digital health interventions using smart breathalyzers and passive monitoring approaches. © 2021, The Author(s).","E-learning; Machine learning; Population statistics; alcohol; Alcohol concentrations; Areas under the curves; Blood-alcohol concentration; Concentration levels; Datapoints; Death rates; Driving motors; Impaired driving; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; alcohol blood level; alcohol consumption; algorithm; Article; behavioral medicine; breath analysis; controlled study; drunken driving; external validity; feature selection; geography; human; machine learning; major clinical study; mortality rate; natural language processing; prediction; priority journal; self monitoring; self report; socioeconomics; time series analysis; traffic accident; United States; Forecasting","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104637365"

We conducted a pilot study to verify the efficacy of i-TOF, a wireless neuromuscular monitoring device connectable to a smartphone, comparing it with TOF WATCH SX. We enrolled 53 patients who underwent general anesthesia. For each patient, we recorded by both devices, in different time intervals, train-of-four (TOF) count/ratio after induction to general anesthesia (TI0–TI3) and during recovery (TR0–TR3). Moreover, post-tetanic count (PTC) was evaluated during deep neuromuscular block (TP0–TP2). We noticed no significant differences between the devices in recorded mean values of TOF ratio, TOF count, and PTC analyzed at time intervals for every phase of general anesthesia, although the i-TOF tends to an underestimation compared to TOF WATCH SX. For each patient, data sessions were successfully recorded by a smartphone. This aspect could be relevant for clinicians in order to have a stored proof of good clinical practice to be added on anesthesiologist records.

However, there is considerable overlap between clinical and radiological features characterizing benign, atypical, and malignant tumors.

Statistical learning models were trained and validated on 62,844 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. We used balanced logistic regression-random forest ensemble classifiers and proportional hazards models to learn multivariate patterns of association between malignancy, survival, and a series of basic clinical variables—such as tumor size, location, and surgical procedure. We demonstrate that our models are capable of predicting meaningful individual-specific clinical outcome variables and show good generalizability across 16 SEER registries. A free smartphone and web application is provided for readers to access and test the predictive models (www.meningioma.app). Future model improvements and prospective replication will be necessary to demonstrate true clinical utility. Rather than being used in isolation, we expect that the proposed models will be integrated into larger and more comprehensive models that integrate imaging and molecular biomarkers.

Herein, we discuss how concepts of algorithmic fairness might apply in healthcare, where predictive algorithms are being increasingly used to support decision-making. Central to our discussion is the distinction between algorithmic fairness and algorithmic bias. Fairness concerns apply specifically when algorithms are used to support polar decisions (i.e., where one pole of prediction leads to decisions that are generally more desired than the other), such as when predictions are used to allocate scarce health care resources to a group of patients that could all benefit. We review different fairness criteria and demonstrate their mutual incompatibility. Even when models are used to balance benefits-harms to make optimal decisions for individuals (i.e., for non-polar decisions)–and fairness concerns are not germane–model, data or sampling issues can lead to biased predictions that support decisions that are differentially harmful/beneficial across groups. We review these potential sources of bias, and also discuss ways to diagnose and remedy algorithmic bias. We note that remedies for algorithmic fairness may be more problematic, since we lack agreed upon definitions of fairness. Finally, we propose a provisional framework for the evaluation of clinical prediction models offered for further elaboration and refinement. Given the proliferation of prediction models used to guide clinical decisions, developing consensus for how these concerns can be addressed should be prioritized. © 2020, The Author(s).","Decision making; Health care; Machine learning; Algorithmics; Decisions makings; Fairness concerns; Fairness criterion; Health disparities; Healthcare resources; Machine learning communities; Mutual incompatibility; Prediction modelling; Predictive algorithms; accountable care organization; algorithm bias; Article; clinical decision making; decision making; forecasting; health disparity; human; justice; machine learning; population health management; prediction; prejudice; priority journal; software; validity; Forecasting","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088807550"

This study suggests that the gains of ICBT for youth with OCD are not only maintained long-term, but that further improvements continue to occur during follow-up. © 2020, The Author(s).","serotonin uptake inhibitor; After-treatment; Children and adolescents; Cognitive-behavior therapies; Cost effective; Follow up; Long-term outcome; Obsessive-compulsive disorders; Post treatment; Randomized trial; Short term; adolescent; Article; child; cognitive behavioral therapy; controlled study; crossover procedure; female; follow up; girl; hospital admission; human; Internet; major clinical study; male; obsessive compulsive disorder; priority journal; psychotherapist; randomized controlled trial; therapy delay; treatment duration; Cost effectiveness","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091407045"

We aimed to examine the effectiveness of a consumer web-based app linked to primary care electronic health records (EHRs). CONNECT was a multicenter randomized controlled trial involving patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) recruited from primary care (Clinical Trial registration ACTRN12613000715774). Intervention participants received an interactive app which was pre-populated and refreshed with EHR risk factor data, diagnoses and, medications. Interactive risk calculators, motivational messages and lifestyle goal tracking were also included. Control group received usual health care. Primary outcome was adherence to guideline-recommended medications (≥80% of days covered for blood pressure (BP) and statin medications). Secondary outcomes included attainment of risk factor targets and eHealth literacy. In total, 934 patients were recruited; mean age 67.6 (±8.1) years. At 12 months, the proportion with >80% days covered with recommended medicines was low overall and there was no difference between the groups (32.8% vs. 29.9%; relative risk [RR] 1.07 [95% CI, 0.88–1.20] p = 0.49). There was borderline improvement in the proportion meeting BP and LDL targets in intervention vs. control (17.1% vs. 12.1% RR 1.40 [95% CI, 0.97–2.03] p = 0.07). The intervention was associated with increased attainment of physical activity targets (87.0% intervention vs. 79.7% control, p = 0.02) and e-health literacy scores (72.6% intervention vs. 64.0% control, p = 0.02). In conclusion, a consumer app integrated with primary health care EHRs was not effective in increasing medication adherence.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) show promise in addressing this problem, but they are limited by a lack of large labeled training datasets. We propose using imperfect but plentiful archived annotations to train CNNs for automated, real-time EEG seizure detection across patients. While these weak annotations indicate possible seizures with precision scores as low as 0.37, they are commonly produced in large volumes within existing clinical workflows by a mixed group of technicians, fellows, students, and board-certified epileptologists. We find that CNNs trained using such weak annotations achieve Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) values of 0.93 and 0.94 for pediatric and adult seizure onset detection, respectively. Compared to currently deployed clinical software, our model provides a 31% increase (18 points) in F1-score for pediatric patients and a 17% increase (11 points) for adult patients.

The current state-of-the-art deep learning models for radiology applications consider only pixel-value information without data informing clinical context. Yet in practice, pertinent and accurate non-imaging data based on the clinical history and laboratory data enable physicians to interpret imaging findings in the appropriate clinical context, leading to a higher diagnostic accuracy, informative clinical decision making, and improved patient outcomes. To achieve a similar goal using deep learning, medical imaging pixel-based models must also achieve the capability to process contextual data from electronic health records (EHR) in addition to pixel data.

We conducted a systematic search on PubMed and Scopus for original research articles leveraging deep learning for fusion of multimodality data. In total, we screened 985 studies and extracted data from 17 papers.

However, our systematic review of the literature reveals few studies studied the impact of different factors on these DL algorithms, that are important for clinical deployment in real-world settings. Using 455,491 retinal images, we evaluated two technical and three image-related factors in detection of referable DR. For technical factors, the performances of four DL models (VGGNet, ResNet, DenseNet, Ensemble) and two computational frameworks (Caffe, TensorFlow) were evaluated while for image-related factors, we evaluated image compression levels (reducing image size, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150 KB), number of fields (7-field, 2-field, 1-field) and media clarity (pseudophakic vs phakic). In detection of referable DR, four DL models showed comparable diagnostic performance (AUC 0.936-0.944). To develop the VGGNet model, two computational frameworks had similar AUC (0.936). The DL performance dropped when image size decreased below 250 KB (AUC 0.936, 0.900, p < 0.001). The DL performance performed better when there were increased number of fields (dataset 1: 2-field vs 1-field—AUC 0.936 vs 0.908, p < 0.001; dataset 2: 7-field vs 2-field vs 1-field, AUC 0.949 vs 0.911 vs 0.895). DL performed better in the pseudophakic than phakic eyes (AUC 0.918 vs 0.833, p < 0.001).

It is unknown if machine learning (ML) models can improve ASCVD risk prediction across broader diverse, real-world populations. We developed ML models for ASCVD risk prediction for multi-ethnic patients using an electronic health record (EHR) database from Northern California. Our cohort included patients aged 18 years or older with no prior CVD and not on statins at baseline (n = 262,923), stratified by PCE-eligible (n = 131,721) or PCE-ineligible patients based on missing or out-of-range variables. We trained ML models [logistic regression with L2 penalty and L1 lasso penalty, random forest, gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting] and determined 5-year ASCVD risk prediction, including with and without incorporation of additional EHR variables, and in Asian and Hispanic subgroups. A total of 4309 patients had ASCVD events, with 2077 in PCE-ineligible patients. GBM performance in the full cohort, including PCE-ineligible patients (area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.835, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.825–0.846), was significantly better than that of the PCE in the PCE-eligible cohort (AUC 0.775, 95% CI: 0.755–0.794). Among patients aged 40–79, GBM performed similarly before (AUC 0.784, 95% CI: 0.759–0.808) and after (AUC 0.790, 95% CI: 0.765–0.814) incorporating additional EHR data. Overall, ML models achieved comparable or improved performance compared to the PCE while allowing risk discrimination in a larger group of patients including PCE-ineligible patients.

Identifying individuals at high risk of progression to late AMD, the sight-threatening stage, is critical for clinical actions, including medical interventions and timely monitoring. Although deep learning has shown promise in diagnosing/screening AMD using color fundus photographs, it remains difficult to predict individuals’ risks of late AMD accurately. For both tasks, these initial deep learning attempts have remained largely unvalidated in independent cohorts. Here, we demonstrate how deep learning and survival analysis can predict the probability of progression to late AMD using 3298 participants (over 80,000 images) from the Age-Related Eye Disease Studies AREDS and AREDS2, the largest longitudinal clinical trials in AMD. When validated against an independent test data set of 601 participants, our model achieved high prognostic accuracy (5-year C-statistic 86.4 (95% confidence interval 86.2–86.6)) that substantially exceeded that of retinal specialists using two existing clinical standards (81.3 (81.1–81.5) and 82.0 (81.8–82.3), respectively). Interestingly, our approach offers additional strengths over the existing clinical standards in AMD prognosis (e.g., risk ascertainment above 50%) and is likely to be highly generalizable, given the breadth of training data from 82 US retinal specialty clinics. Indeed, during external validation through training on AREDS and testing on AREDS2 as an independent cohort, our model retained substantially higher prognostic accuracy than existing clinical standards.

In the context of cancer, changes in these passively sensed digital biomarkers may reflect meaningful variation in functional status, symptom burden, quality of life, and risk for adverse clinical outcomes. These data could enable real-time remote monitoring of patients between clinical encounters and more proactive, comprehensive, and personalized care. Over the past few years, small studies across a variety of cancer populations support the feasibility and potential clinical value of mobile sensors in oncology. Barriers to implementing mobile sensing in clinical oncology care include the challenges of managing and making sense of continuous sensor data, patient engagement issues, difficulty integrating sensor data into existing electronic health systems and clinical workflows, and ethical and privacy concerns. Multidisciplinary collaboration is needed to develop mobile sensing frameworks that overcome these barriers and that can be implemented at large-scale for remote monitoring of deteriorating health during or after cancer treatment or for promotion and tailoring of lifestyle or symptom management interventions. Leveraging digital technology has the potential to enrich scientific understanding of how cancer and its treatment affect patient lives, to use this understanding to offer more timely and personalized support to patients, and to improve clinical oncology outcomes. © 2020, The Author(s).","Clinical research; Diseases; mHealth; Oncology; Patient treatment; Remote control; Wearable sensors; Cancer research; Clinical oncology; Clinical outcome; Mobile sensing; Mobile sensors; Quality of life; Real world setting; Sensors data; Smart phones; Wearable devices; cancer research; cancer therapy; clinical outcome; consumer health information; human; priority journal; remote sensing; Review; tumor promotion; workflow; Smartphones","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094155178"

This requires quasi-continuous measurements and a procedure to map the data onto a parsimonious control model with a degree of universality. The current research illustrates this approach using glucose homeostasis as a target. Data were obtained from 41 healthy subjects wearing over-the-counter glucose monitors, and projected onto a simple proportional–integral (PI) controller, widely used in engineering applications.

Treatment typically involves the surgical implantation of a pressure-regulated silicone tube assembly, known as a shunt. Unfortunately, shunts have extremely high failure rates and diagnosing shunt malfunction is challenging due to a combination of vague symptoms and a lack of a convenient means to monitor flow. Here, we introduce a wireless, wearable device that enables precise measurements of CSF flow, continuously or intermittently, in hospitals, laboratories or even in home settings. The technology exploits measurements of thermal transport through near-surface layers of skin to assess flow, with a soft, flexible, and skin-conformal device that can be constructed using commercially available components. Systematic benchtop studies and numerical simulations highlight all of the key considerations. Measurements on 7 patients establish high levels of functionality, with data that reveal time dependent changes in flow associated with positional and inertial effects on the body. Taken together, the results suggest a significant advance in monitoring capabilities for patients with shunted hydrocephalus, with potential for practical use across a range of settings and circumstances, and additional utility for research purposes in studies of CSF hydrodynamics. © 2020, The Author(s).","Brain; Diagnosis; Failure analysis; Silicones; Failure rate; Fluid-flow; Inertial effect; Measurements of; Near-surface layers; Precise measurements; Thermal transport; Time-dependent changes; Wearable devices; Wireless monitoring; adult; anthropometry; Article; cerebrospinal fluid flow; cerebrospinal fluid shunting; clinical article; female; home care; human; hydrocephalus; hydrodynamics; male; miniaturization; non invasive procedure; patient monitoring; priority journal; skin surface; wireless communication; young adult; Cerebrospinal fluid","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088419084"

AI-doscopist)”, to localise colonic neoplasia during colonoscopy. This study aims to evaluate the agreement between endoscopists and AI-doscopist for colorectal neoplasm localisation. AI-doscopist was pre-trained by 1.2 million non-medical images and fine-tuned by 291,090 colonoscopy and non-medical images. The colonoscopy images were obtained from six databases, where the colonoscopy images were classified into 13 categories and the polyps’ locations were marked image-by-image by the smallest bounding boxes. Seven categories of non-medical images, which were believed to share some common features with colorectal polyps, were downloaded from an online search engine. Written informed consent were obtained from 144 patients who underwent colonoscopy and their full colonoscopy videos were prospectively recorded for evaluation. A total of 128 suspicious lesions were resected or biopsied for histological confirmation. When evaluated image-by-image on the 144 full colonoscopies, the specificity of AI-doscopist was 93.3%. AI-doscopist were able to localise 124 out of 128 polyps (polyp-based sensitivity = 96.9%). Furthermore, after reviewing the suspected regions highlighted by AI-doscopist in a 102-patient cohort, an endoscopist has high confidence in recognizing four missed polyps in three patients who were not diagnosed with any lesion during their original colonoscopies. In summary, AI-doscopist can localise 96.9% of the polyps resected by the endoscopists. If AI-doscopist were to be used in real-time, it can potentially assist endoscopists in detecting one more patient with polyp in every 20–33 colonoscopies. © 2020, The Author(s).","Edge computing; Endoscopy; Medical imaging; Search engines; Artificial intelligent; Classifieds; Colonoscopy; Colorectal neoplasms; Computing devices; Edge computing; Learning models; Learning-based algorithms; Localisation; Real- time; Article; artificial intelligence; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; colon biopsy; colon tumor; colonoscopy; colorectal polyp; colorectal tumor; computer assisted diagnosis; data base; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; edge detection; endoscopist; false negative result; false positive result; gold standard; histopathology; human; image analysis; major clinical study; missed diagnosis; priority journal; prospective study; sensitivity and specificity; validation study; videorecording; Deep learning","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088069034"

Sleep staging using cardiac rhythm is an active area of research because it can be measured much more easily using a wide variety of both medical and consumer-grade devices. In this study, we applied deep learning methods to create an algorithm for automated sleep stage scoring using the instantaneous heart rate (IHR) time series extracted from the electrocardiogram (ECG). We trained and validated an algorithm on over 10,000 nights of data from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). The algorithm has an overall performance of 0.77 accuracy and 0.66 kappa against the reference stages on a held-out portion of the SHHS dataset for classifying every 30 s of sleep into four classes: wake, light sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM). Moreover, we demonstrate that the algorithm generalizes well to an independent dataset of 993 subjects labeled by American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) licensed clinical staff at Massachusetts General Hospital that was not used for training or validation. Finally, we demonstrate that the stages predicted by our algorithm can reproduce previous clinical studies correlating sleep stages with comorbidities such as sleep apnea and hypertension as well as demographics such as age and gender. © 2020, The Author(s).","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Electrocardiograms; Eye movements; Learning systems; Personnel training; Sleep research; Active area; Cardiac rhythms; Data collection; Health-study; Human expert; Instantaneous heart rates; Long term study; Multi-modal data; Sleep stage; Sleep staging; algorithm; Article; atherosclerosis; clinical outcome; comorbidity; correlation analysis; deep learning; deep neural network; electrocardiogram; electroencephalogram; heart rate; heart rate variability; heart rhythm; human; hypertension; model; nonREM sleep; polysomnography; priority journal; REM sleep; scoring system; sleep disorder; sleep disordered breathing; sleep stage; sleep waking cycle; slow wave sleep; stage 1 sleep; stage 2 sleep; time series analysis; validation study; Heart","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089700102"

While validated patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are increasingly used in trials, their adoption in care remains limited and generally separated from the medical record. Further, absence of systematic processes for patient-led data submission excludes valuable data from digital devices that can potentially aid in contextualizing health status. With prior experience in developing apps for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), we sought to make collecting patient-generated health data (PGHD) a fundamental property of health information technology at scale, and in an interoperable, standards-compliant fashion. We build upon the open SMART on FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources) specification to create SMART Markers—a mobile device software framework encapsulating functionality needed for rapid deployment of both patient- and practitioner-facing PGHD apps. We refactored previously developed PROMIS apps to use SMART Markers for handling PGHD-request creation, on-device administration, and generation of a variety of PGHD types and submission of results to a FHIR server. Validation and conformance tests were performed on the generated output and app-reusability was demonstrated across two demo servers. App developers can import SMART Markers into their existing or new apps to readily leverage an interoperable PGHD capturing functionality out of the box, without having to reinvent the wheel. Our approach enables the creation of health system integrated, context-specific experiences for both patients and practitioners. © 2020, The Author(s).","Computer programming; Digital devices; Health; Reusability; Data submission; Health data; Health informations; Health status; Health systems; Measurement information; Medical record; Patient-reported outcomes; Property; Systematic process; adult; article; human; information system; medical information; medical record; outcome assessment; patient-reported outcome; physician; software; Interoperability","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088414743"

This framework uses two distinct, complementary deep neural networks. The first neural network enhances and standardizes the blood smear images captured by the smartphone microscope, spatially and spectrally matching the image quality of a laboratory-grade benchtop microscope. The second network acts on the output of the first image enhancement neural network and is used to perform the semantic segmentation between healthy and sickle cells within a blood smear. These segmented images are then used to rapidly determine the SCD diagnosis per patient. We blindly tested this mobile sickle cell detection method using blood smears from 96 unique patients (including 32 SCD patients) that were imaged by our smartphone microscope, and achieved ~98% accuracy, with an area-under-the-curve of 0.998. With its high accuracy, this mobile and cost-effective method has the potential to be used as a screening tool for SCD and other blood cell disorders in resource-limited settings. © 2020, The Author(s).","Blood; Cells; Cost effectiveness; Cytology; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Image enhancement; Microscopes; Patient treatment; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Automated screening; Automatic screening; Blood smears; Health priorities; Learning frameworks; Matchings; Neural-networks; Sickle cell; Sickle cell disease; Smart phones; adolescent; adult; Article; autoanalysis; blood smear; cell screening; child; deep learning; deep neural network; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; human; image enhancement; image quality; image segmentation; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; sickle cell; sickle cell anemia; Smartphones","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088065766"

Here we show that automatic speech recognition is feasible in psychotherapy, but further improvements in accuracy are needed before widespread use. Our HIPAA-compliant automatic speech recognition system demonstrated a transcription word error rate of 25%. For depression-related utterances, sensitivity was 80% and positive predictive value was 83%. For clinician-identified harm-related sentences, the word error rate was 34%.

Data generated from smartwatches (PGHD_SW) is a form of patient-generated health data, which can benefit providers by supplying frequent temporal information about patients. The goal of this study was to understand providers’ perceptions towards PGHD_SW adoption and its integration with electronic medical records. In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 providers from internal medicine, family medicine, geriatric medicine, nursing, surgery, rehabilitation, and anesthesiology. Diffusion of Innovations was used as a framework to develop questions and guide data analysis. The constant comparative method was utilized to formulate salient themes from the interviews. Four main themes emerged: (1) PGHD_SW is perceived as a relative advantage; (2) data are viewed as compatible with current practices; (3) barriers to overcome to effectively use PGHD_SW; (4) assessments from viewing sample data. Overall, PGHD_SW was valued because it enabled access to information about patients that were traditionally unattainable. It also can initiate discussions between patients and providers. Providers consider PGHD_SW important, but data preferences varied by specialty. The successful adoption of PGHD_SW will depend on tailoring data, frequencies of reports, and visualization preferences to correspond with the demands of providers. © 2020, The Author(s).","Data visualization; Medical computing; Comparative methods; Diffusion of innovations; Health data; Internal medicine; Medical record; Physical activity; Qualitative interviews; Semi-structured; Temporal information; Wearable devices; access to information; adoption; adult; anesthesiology; article; attitude; constant comparative method; data analysis; diffusion; electronic medical record; family medicine; geriatrics; human; internal medicine; interview; medical record; perception; secondary health care; Medicine","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088418961"

These devices have strong appeal because they allow for continuous, scalable, unobtrusive, and ecologically valid data collection of cardiac activity in “big data” studies. However, replicability and reproducibility may be hampered moving forward due to the lack of standardization of data collection and processing procedures, and inconsistent reporting of technological factors (e.g., device type, firmware versions, and sampling rate), biobehavioral variables (e.g., body mass index, wrist dominance and circumference), and participant demographic characteristics, such as skin tone, that may influence heart rate measurement. These limitations introduce unnecessary noise into measurement, which can cloud interpretation and generalizability of findings. This paper provides a brief overview of research using commercial wearable devices to measure heart rate, reviews literature on device accuracy, and outlines the challenges that non-standardized reporting pose for the field. We also discuss study design, technological, biobehavioral, and demographic factors that can impact the accuracy of the passive sensing of heart rate measurements, and provide guidelines and corresponding checklist handouts for future study data collection and design, data cleaning and processing, analysis, and reporting that may help ameliorate some of these barriers and inconsistencies in the literature. © 2020, The Author(s).","Cleaning; Data acquisition; Data handling; Heart; Population statistics; Wearable technology; Cardiac activity; Data collection; Health outcomes; Heart-rate; Measurements of; Mental health; Physical health; Rate measurements; Replicability; Reproducibilities; checklist; cleaning; consumer; demography; heart rate measurement; human; human experiment; noise; practice guideline; review; wrist; Firmware","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088067948"

Yet, little is known about the degree to which the digital health industry has focused on the key domains in the health continuum, including prevention, detection, and management. We performed a cross-sectional study of a US digital health industry cohort that received publicly disclosed funding from 2011–2018. We assessed the number of companies; respective funding within each part of the health continuum; and products and services by technology type, clinical indication, purchasers, and end users. In this emerging industry, most companies focused on management of disease and the minority on prevention or detection. This asymmetry, which is similar to the traditional healthcare system, represents an opportunity to focus on earlier parts of the health continuum. Patients were a common purchaser of all products, but especially prevention-focused digital health products, implying a large unmet need not yet served by the traditional healthcare system. © 2020, The Author(s).","Clinical research; Health care; Cross-sectional study; Current status; End-users; External funding; Fundings; Health continuum; Health industry; Healthcare systems; Policy regulations; Product and services; Article; artificial intelligence; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; digital health industry; disease management; funding; health care system; human; priority journal; prophylaxis; technology; telemedicine; Finance","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088068996"

Here, by applying automated image analysis and machine learning approaches, we evaluate the prognostic significance of these cellular subpopulations and their spatial interactions. Resultant data, from a training cohort retrospectively collated from Edinburgh, UK hospitals (n = 113), were used to create a combinatorial prognostic model, which identified a subpopulation of patients who exhibit 100% survival over a 5-year follow-up period. The combinatorial model integrated lymphocytic infiltration, the number of lymphocytes within 50-μm proximity to TBs, and the CD68+/CD163+ macrophage ratio. This finding was confirmed on an independent validation cohort, which included patients treated in Japan and Scotland (n = 117).

From the Korean National Health Insurance Service database between 2002 and 2010, we obtained de-identified health data in elders above 65 years (N = 40,736) containing 4,894 unique clinical features including ICD-10 codes, medication codes, laboratory values, history of personal and family illness and socio-demographics. To define incident AD we considered two operational definitions: “definite AD” with diagnostic codes and dementia medication (n = 614) and “probable AD” with only diagnosis (n = 2026). We trained and validated random forest, support vector machine and logistic regression to predict incident AD in 1, 2, 3, and 4 subsequent years. For predicting future incidence of AD in balanced samples (bootstrapping), the machine learning models showed reasonable performance in 1-year prediction with AUC of 0.775 and 0.759, based on “definite AD” and “probable AD” outcomes, respectively; in 2-year, 0.730 and 0.693; in 3-year, 0.677 and 0.644; in 4-year, 0.725 and 0.683. The results were similar when the entire (unbalanced) samples were used. Important clinical features selected in logistic regression included hemoglobin level, age and urine protein level. This study may shed a light on the utility of the data-driven machine learning model based on large-scale administrative health data in AD risk prediction, which may enable better selection of individuals at risk for AD in clinical trials or early detection in clinical settings. © 2020, The Author(s).","Diagnosis; Diseases; Forecasting; Health insurance; Health risks; Logistic regression; Support vector machines; Viruses; hemoglobin; Alzheimer; Clinical features; Health data; Large-scales; Logistics regressions; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Model-based OPC; Risk prediction models; Sociodemographics; age; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; bootstrapping; cohort analysis; data base; female; hemoglobin blood level; human; incidence; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; male; medical record; prediction; priority journal; protein urine level; random forest; support vector machine; Decision trees","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088412971"

Precise management based on artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise; however, a clinical application that fully integrates prediction and telehealth computing has not been achieved, and further efforts are required to validate its real-world benefits. Taking congenital cataract as a representative, we used Bayesian and deep-learning algorithms to create CC-Guardian, an AI agent that incorporates individualized prediction and scheduling, and intelligent telehealth follow-up computing. Our agent exhibits high sensitivity and specificity in both internal and multi-resource validation. We integrate our agent with a web-based smartphone app and prototype a prediction-telehealth cloud platform to support our intelligent follow-up system. We then conduct a retrospective self-controlled test validating that our system not only accurately detects and addresses complications at earlier stages, but also reduces the socioeconomic burdens compared to conventional methods.

Four databases were searched for articles published before January 2020, and 24 articles that met selection criteria were included in this analysis. Rationale for pursuing virtual models of care shared two common objectives: (1) the need for sustainable survivorship care, and (2) the opportunity to improve survivorship outcomes. Breast cancer (N = 10) and prostate cancer (N = 4) were the most targeted cancers for virtual survivorship care. The implemented technologies included web platforms (N = 15), telephone calls (N = 12), and smartphone or tablet applications (N = 5). A variety of healthcare professionals were effectively involved in the provision of virtual care. Future virtual care models may benefit from integrating with existing health systems and services, repurposing common technologies, involving allied health professionals, and engaging patients and caregivers from diverse communities in the design of virtual services. © 2020, The Author(s).","mHealth; Patient treatment; Breast Cancer; Cancer survivorships; Chronic effects; Future innovations; Health systems; Prostate cancers; Scoping review; Selection criteria; System Capacity; Virtual models; breast cancer; cancer survivor; childhood cancer; female genital tract cancer; health care personnel; human; malignant neoplasm; nonbiological model; priority journal; prostate cancer; Review; survivorship; systematic review; virtual care model; Diseases","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090771834"

The aim of this study was to examine whether growth velocity (length and weight) of infants differs by seasons. We assessed longitudinal measurement data obtained for 9,409 Japanese infants whose parents used the mobile phone application, “Papatto Ikuji”, during the period from January 2014 to October 2017. On average, each infant had 4.8 entries for length and 5.4 entries for weight. The mean daily change in sex- and age-adjusted z-scores between two time points was estimated as the growth velocity during that period: ΔLAZ/day and ΔWAZ/day for length and weight, respectively. We analyzed 20,007 ΔLAZ/day (mean, −0.0022) and 33,236 ΔWAZ/day (mean, 0.0005) measurements, and found that ΔLAZ/day showed seasonal differences with increases during summer. We conducted a multilevel linear regression analysis, in which effects of age, sex, nutrition and season of birth were adjusted, showing significant difference in ΔLAZ/day between winter and summer with a mean ΔLAZ/day difference of 0.0026 (95%CI 0.0015 to 0.0036; P < 0.001). This seasonal difference corresponded to 13% of the average linear growth velocity in 6-month-old infants. A modest effect of nutrition on linear growth was observed with a mean ΔLAZ/day difference of 0.0015 (95%CI 0.0006 to 0.0025; P < 0.001) between predominantly formula-fed infants and breastfed infants.

The American Psychiatric Association’s app evaluation model has emerged as a way to critically assess an app by considering accessibility, privacy and security, clinical foundation, engagement, and interoperability; however, there is no centralized database where users can view how various health apps perform when assessed via the APA model. In this perspective, we propose and outline our effort to translate the APA’s model for the evaluation of health apps into a set of objective metrics that can be published online, making the framework actionable and accessible to a broad audience. The questions from the APA model were operationalized into 105 objective questions that are either binary or numeric. These questions serve as the foundation of an online database, where app evaluation consists of answering these 105 questions and can be crowdsourced. While the database has yet to be published and crowdsourced, initial internal testing demonstrated excellent interrater reliability. The database proposed here introduces a public and interactive approach to data collection that is guided by the APA model. The published product enables users to sort through the many mobile health apps and filter them according to individual preferences and priorities, making the ever-growing health app market more navigable. © 2020, The Author(s).","Crowdsourcing; mHealth; And filters; Centralized data-base; Data collection; Evaluation models; Interactive approach; Interrater reliability; Objective metrics; Online database; Privacy and security; S models; Article; computer security; data base; health care access; information processing; interrater reliability; priority journal; privacy; Database systems","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088800233"

These developments make accurate sleep monitoring at scale a possibility for the first time. Vast amounts of multi-sensor data are being generated with potential applications ranging from large-scale epidemiological research linking sleep patterns to disease, to wellness applications, including the sleep coaching of individuals with chronic conditions. However, in order to realise the full potential of these technologies for individuals, medicine and research, several significant challenges must be overcome. There are important outstanding questions regarding performance evaluation, as well as data storage, curation, processing, integration, modelling and interpretation. Here, we leverage expertise across neuroscience, clinical medicine, bioengineering, electrical engineering, epidemiology, computer science, mHealth and human–computer interaction to discuss the digitisation of sleep from a inter-disciplinary perspective. We introduce the state-of-the-art in sleep-monitoring technologies, and discuss the opportunities and challenges from data acquisition to the eventual application of insights in clinical and consumer settings.

Participation in systems thinking activities creates opportunities for participants to gain useful insights about complexity. It is desirable to design activities that extend the benefits of this participation into communities, as these insights are predictive of success in community-based prevention. This study tests an online, computer-mediated participatory system modelling platform (STICKE) and associated methods for collating and analysing its outputs. STICKE was trialled among a group of community members to test a computer-mediated system modelling exercise. The causal diagrams resulting from the exercise were then merged, and network analysis and DEMATEL methods applied to inform the generation of a smaller summary model to communicate insights from the participant group as a whole. Participants successfully completed the online modelling activity, and created causal diagrams consistent with expectations. The DEMATEL analysis was identified as the participant-preferred method for converging individuals causal diagrams into a coherent and useful summary. STICKE is an accessible tool that enabled participants to create causal diagrams online. Methods trialled in this study provide a protocol for combining and summarising individual causal diagrams that was perceived to be useful by the participant group. STICKE supports communities to consider and respond to complex problems at a local level, which is cornerstone of sustainable effective prevention. Understanding how communities perceive their own health challenges will be important to better support and inform locally owned prevention efforts. © 2020, The Author(s).","Complex networks; Graphic methods; Analytic technique; Causal diagram; Community-based; Community-based participatory research; DEMATEL; Design activity; Modeling platforms; On-line modelling; System models; System thinkings; adult; article; controlled study; exercise; expectation; female; human; human experiment; male; online system; Systems thinking","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088414099"

However, their clinical integration is challenged by an insufficient validation of the many existing and often abstract metrics. Here, we propose a data-driven framework to select and validate a clinically relevant core set of digital health metrics extracted from a technology-aided assessment. As an exemplary use-case, the framework is applied to the Virtual Peg Insertion Test (VPIT), a technology-aided assessment of upper limb sensorimotor impairments. The framework builds on a use-case-specific pathophysiological motivation of metrics, models demographic confounds, and evaluates the most important clinimetric properties (discriminant validity, structural validity, reliability, measurement error, learning effects). Applied to 77 metrics of the VPIT collected from 120 neurologically intact and 89 affected individuals, the framework allowed selecting 10 clinically relevant core metrics. These assessed the severity of multiple sensorimotor impairments in a valid, reliable, and informative manner. These metrics provided added clinical value by detecting impairments in neurological subjects that did not show any deficits according to conventional scales, and by covering sensorimotor impairments of the arm and hand with a single assessment. The proposed framework provides a transparent, step-by-step selection procedure based on clinically relevant evidence. This creates an interesting alternative to established selection algorithms that optimize mathematical loss functions and are not always intuitive to retrace. This could help addressing the insufficient clinical integration of digital health metrics. For the VPIT, it allowed establishing validated core metrics, paving the way for their integration into neurorehabilitation trials. © 2020, The Author(s).","Functions; Neurology; Abstract metrics; Core set; Data driven; METRIC model; Neurological disorders; Pathophysiological; Property; Reliability measurements; Sensorimotors; Upper limbs; adult; algorithm; article; demography; discriminant validity; female; human; human experiment; learning; loss of function mutation; major clinical study; male; measurement error; motivation; nervous system; neurorehabilitation; reliability; upper limb; Integration","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088068520"

In all, 318 outpatients were enroled. The agent was perceived as trustworthy and well accepted by the patients, confirming the good engagement of patients in the interaction.

Yet, there is no standardized process for evaluating the validity of this research and the methods adopted in the design of these studies. We conduct a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art in predicting mental health status using social media data, focusing on characteristics of the study design, methods, and research design.

This observation provides the foundation for “precision rehabilitation”. Tracking and predicting outcomes defining the recovery trajectory is key in this context. Data collected using wearable sensors provide clinicians with the opportunity to do so with little burden on clinicians and patients. The approach proposed in this paper relies on machine learning-based algorithms to derive clinical score estimates from wearable sensor data collected during functional motor tasks. Sensor-based score estimates showed strong agreement with those generated by clinicians. Score estimates of upper-limb impairment severity and movement quality were marked by a coefficient of determination of 0.86 and 0.79, respectively. The application of the proposed approach to monitoring patients’ responsiveness to rehabilitation is expected to contribute to the development of patient-specific interventions, aiming to maximize motor gains. © 2020, The Author(s).","Machine learning; Patient rehabilitation; Patient treatment; Clinical study; Learning-based algorithms; Machine-learning; Motor recovery; Motor tasks; On-machines; Patient specific; Predicting outcomes; Sensors data; Upper limbs; adult; Article; brain hemorrhage; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; clinical outcome; clinician; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; disease severity; female; human; limb disease; longitudinal study; machine learning; male; middle aged; motor dysfunction; motor performance; neurorehabilitation; personalized medicine; priority journal; prospective study; traumatic brain injury; treatment response; upper limb; Wearable sensors","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091304146"

However, many current approaches require the use of multiple devices, or performance of prescribed motor activities, which makes them ill-suited for free-living conditions. Furthermore, there is a lack of open methods that have demonstrated both criterion and discriminative validity for continuous objective assessment of motor symptoms in this population. Hence, there is a need for systems that can reduce patient burden by using a minimal sensor setup while continuously capturing clinically meaningful measures of motor symptom severity under free-living conditions. We propose a method that sequentially processes epochs of raw sensor data from a single wrist-worn accelerometer by using heuristic and machine learning models in a hierarchical framework to provide continuous monitoring of tremor and bradykinesia. Results show that sensor derived continuous measures of resting tremor and bradykinesia achieve good to strong agreement with clinical assessment of symptom severity and are able to discriminate between treatment-related changes in motor states. © 2020, The Author(s).","Disease control; Heuristic methods; levodopa; 'current; Daily lives; Disease management; Disease symptoms; Free livings; Living conditions; Multiple devices; Objective assessment; Performance; Wearable devices; adult; aged; Article; bradykinesia; clinical article; controlled study; criterion related validity; discriminant validity; disease severity; female; human; machine learning; male; motor activity; Parkinson disease; priority journal; tremor; Wearable sensors","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088320932"

To do this, we formed an international consortium (4CE) of 96 hospitals across five countries (www.covidclinical.net). Contributors utilized the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) or Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) platforms to map to a common data model. The group focused on temporal changes in key laboratory test values. Harmonized data were analyzed locally and converted to a shared aggregate form for rapid analysis and visualization of regional differences and global commonalities. Data covered 27,584 COVID-19 cases with 187,802 laboratory tests. Case counts and laboratory trajectories were concordant with existing literature. Laboratory tests at the time of diagnosis showed hospital-level differences equivalent to country-level variation across the consortium partners. Despite the limitations of decentralized data generation, we established a framework to capture the trajectory of COVID-19 disease in patients and their response to interventions. © 2020, The Author(s).","Data visualization; Diagnosis; E-learning; eHealth; Hospitals; Laboratories; Patient treatment; Records management; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; C reactive protein; creatinine; D dimer; lactate dehydrogenase; procalcitonin; Clinical course; Common data model; Electronic health; Health records; Informatics; International consortium; Laboratory test; Rapid analysis; Regional differences; Temporal change; acute kidney failure; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; bilirubin blood level; child; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; electronic health record; female; France; Germany; hospital; human; infant; Italy; laboratory test; leukocyte count; major clinical study; male; priority journal; Singapore; very elderly; COVID-19","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089557407"

Hence, we developed an innovative deep-learning framework, empowered with a certainty estimation level, designed for haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides analysis, with special focus on follicular lymphoma (FL) diagnosis. Whole-slide images of lymph nodes affected by FL or follicular hyperplasia were used for training, validating, and finally testing Bayesian neural networks (BNN). These BNN provide a diagnostic prediction coupled with an effective certainty estimation, and generate accurate diagnosis with an area under the curve reaching 0.99. Through its uncertainty estimation, our network is also able to detect unfamiliar data such as other small B cell lymphomas or technically heterogeneous cases from external centres. We demonstrate that machine-learning techniques are sensitive to the pre-processing of histopathology slides and require appropriate training to build universal tools to aid diagnosis. © 2020, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Learning systems; Neural networks; Oncology; Statistical tests; eosin; hematoxylin; Bayesian neural networks; Centralised; Follicular lymphoma; Haematoxylin; Histopathological diagnosis; Learning frameworks; Lymph node; Technical process; Tissue sections; Whole slide images; Article; Bayesian network; cancer diagnosis; convolutional neural network; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; follicular lymphoma; histopathology; human; human tissue; lymph node; lymphoid hyperplasia; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; Bayesian networks","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088066235"

Although the classification of abnormal cardiac rhythms such as atrial fibrillation from wearable devices has great potential, commercial algorithms remain proprietary and tend to focus on heart rate variability derived from green spectrum LED sensors placed on the wrist, where noise remains an unsolved problem. Here we develop DeepBeat, a multitask deep learning method to jointly assess signal quality and arrhythmia event detection in wearable photoplethysmography devices for real-time detection of atrial fibrillation. The model is trained on approximately one million simulated unlabeled physiological signals and fine-tuned on a curated dataset of over 500 K labeled signals from over 100 individuals from 3 different wearable devices. We demonstrate that, in comparison with a single-task model, our architecture using unsupervised transfer learning through convolutional denoising autoencoders dramatically improves the performance of atrial fibrillation detection from a F1 score of 0.54 to 0.96. We also include in our evaluation a prospectively derived replication cohort of ambulatory participants where the algorithm performed with high sensitivity (0.98), specificity (0.99), and F1 score (0.93).

Machine learning techniques may offer more powerful means to predict disease course in MS patients. In our study, 724 patients from the Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation in MS at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (CLIMB study) and 400 patients from the EPIC dataset, University of California, San Francisco, were included in the analysis. The primary outcome was an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) ≥ 1.5 (worsening) or not (non-worsening) at up to 5 years after the baseline visit. Classification models were built using the CLIMB dataset with patients’ clinical and MRI longitudinal observations in first 2 years, and further validated using the EPIC dataset. We compared the performance of three popular machine learning algorithms (SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest) and three ensemble learning approaches (XGBoost, LightGBM, and a Meta-learner L). A “threshold” was established to trade-off the performance between the two classes. Predictive features were identified and compared among different models. Machine learning models achieved 0.79 and 0.83 AUC scores for the CLIMB and EPIC datasets, respectively, shortly after disease onset. Ensemble learning methods were more effective and robust compared to standalone algorithms. Two ensemble models, XGBoost and LightGBM were superior to the other four models evaluated in our study. Of variables evaluated, EDSS, Pyramidal Function, and Ambulatory Index were the top common predictors in forecasting the MS disease course. Machine learning techniques, in particular ensemble methods offer increased accuracy for the prediction of MS disease course. © 2020, The Author(s).","Classification (of information); Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Logistic regression; Random forests; Support vector machines; Classification models; Ensemble learning; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning techniques; Multiple sclerosis; Performance; Regression forests; San Francisco; SVM-Logistic regression; University of California; Article; brain size; disease course; ensemble learning; Expanded Disability Status Scale; feature selection; gray matter; human; learning algorithm; logistic regression analysis; multiple sclerosis; nested cross validation; priority journal; random forest; support vector machine; Decision trees","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092556403"

Therefore, we provide an insight into the currently available AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms that have been approved by the US Food & Drugs Administration (FDA). We aimed to raise awareness of the importance of regulatory bodies, clearly stating whether a medical device is AI/ML based or not. Cross-checking and validating all approvals, we identified 64 AI/ML based, FDA approved medical devices and algorithms. Out of those, only 29 (45%) mentioned any AI/ML-related expressions in the official FDA announcement. The majority (85.9%) was approved by the FDA with a 510(k) clearance, while 8 (12.5%) received de novo pathway clearance and one (1.6%) premarket approval (PMA) clearance. Most of these technologies, notably 30 (46.9%), 16 (25.0%), and 10 (15.6%) were developed for the fields of Radiology, Cardiology and Internal Medicine/General Practice respectively.

Chest x-ray is often used to assist in diagnosis, yet this presents additional challenges due to atypical radiographic presentation and radiologist shortages in regions where co-infection is most common. We developed a deep learning algorithm to diagnose TB using clinical information and chest x-ray images from 677 HIV-positive patients with suspected TB from two hospitals in South Africa. We then sought to determine whether the algorithm could assist clinicians in the diagnosis of TB in HIV-positive patients as a web-based diagnostic assistant. Use of the algorithm resulted in a modest but statistically significant improvement in clinician accuracy (p = 0.002), increasing the mean clinician accuracy from 0.60 (95% CI 0.57, 0.63) without assistance to 0.65 (95% CI 0.60, 0.70) with assistance. However, the accuracy of assisted clinicians was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than that of the stand-alone algorithm, which had an accuracy of 0.79 (95% CI 0.77, 0.82) on the same unseen test cases. These results suggest that deep learning assistance may improve clinician accuracy in TB diagnosis using chest x-rays, which would be valuable in settings with a high burden of HIV/TB co-infection. Moreover, the high accuracy of the stand-alone algorithm suggests a potential value particularly in settings with a scarcity of radiological expertise. © 2020, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Diagnosis; X ray radiography; Atypicals; Chest X-ray image; Chest x-rays; Clinical information; Co-infections; South Africa; Stand-alone algorithm; Test case; Tuberculosis diagnosis; Web based; adult; algorithm; Article; clinician; cohort analysis; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; mixed infection; multicenter study; priority journal; South Africa; thorax radiography; Learning algorithms","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090392787"

Interpretable machine learning (ML) may assist in transparently identifying the risk of important outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hospitalizations at a tertiary academic medical center and its branches from January 2011 to May 2018. A consecutive sample of all hospitalizations in the study period were included. Algorithms were trained on medical, sociodemographic, and institutional variables to predict readmission, length of stay (LOS), and death within 48–72 h. Prediction performance was measured by area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), Brier score loss (BSL), which measures how well predicted probability matches observed probability, and other metrics. Interpretations were generated using multiple feature extraction algorithms. The study cohort included 1,485,880 hospitalizations for 708,089 unique patients (median age of 59 years, first and third quartiles (QI) [39, 73]; 55.6% female; 71% white). There were 211,022 30-day readmissions for an overall readmission rate of 14% (for patients ≥65 years: 16%). Median LOS, including observation and labor and delivery patients, was 2.94 days (QI [1.67, 5.34]), or, if these patients are excluded, 3.71 days (QI [2.15, 6.51]). Predictive performance was as follows: 30-day readmission (AUC 0.76/BSL 0.11); LOS > 5 days (AUC 0.84/BSL 0.15); death within 48–72 h (AUC 0.91/BSL 0.001).

Grading systems are often used, but are unreliable as domain experts disagree on disease severity category thresholds. These discrete categories also do not reflect the underlying continuous spectrum of disease severity. To address these issues, we developed a convolutional Siamese neural network approach to evaluate disease severity at single time points and change between longitudinal patient visits on a continuous spectrum. We demonstrate this in two medical imaging domains: retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in retinal photographs and osteoarthritis in knee radiographs. Our patient cohorts consist of 4861 images from 870 patients in the Imaging and Informatics in Retinopathy of Prematurity (i-ROP) cohort study and 10,012 images from 3021 patients in the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST), both of which feature longitudinal imaging data. Multiple expert clinician raters ranked 100 retinal images and 100 knee radiographs from excluded test sets for severity of ROP and osteoarthritis, respectively. The Siamese neural network output for each image in comparison to a pool of normal reference images correlates with disease severity rank (ρ = 0.87 for ROP and ρ = 0.89 for osteoarthritis), both within and between the clinical grading categories. Thus, this output can represent the continuous spectrum of disease severity at any single time point. The difference in these outputs can be used to show change over time. Alternatively, paired images from the same patient at two time points can be directly compared using the Siamese neural network, resulting in an additional continuous measure of change between images. Importantly, our approach does not require manual localization of the pathology of interest and requires only a binary label for training (same versus different). The location of disease and site of change detected by the algorithm can be visualized using an occlusion sensitivity map-based approach. For a longitudinal binary change detection task, our Siamese neural networks achieve test set receiving operator characteristic area under the curves (AUCs) of up to 0.90 in evaluating ROP or knee osteoarthritis change, depending on the change detection strategy. The overall performance on this binary task is similar compared to a conventional convolutional deep-neural network trained for multi-class classification. Our results demonstrate that convolutional Siamese neural networks can be a powerful tool for evaluating the continuous spectrum of disease severity and change in medical imaging. © 2020, The Author(s).","Change detection; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Eye protection; Grading; Ophthalmology; Radiography; Change detection; Change-over time; Clinical decision making; Continuous spectrum; Disease severity; Grading system; Neural-networks; Retinopathy of prematurity; Test sets; Time points; area under the curve; Article; clinician; cohort analysis; controlled study; convolutional neural network; diagnostic imaging; disease severity; eye photography; human; knee osteoarthritis; knee radiography; longitudinal study; major clinical study; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; retina image; retrolental fibroplasia; task performance; Medical imaging","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088418597"

It remains an industry-wide challenge to provide credible evidence, therefore, hindering wider adoption. Conventional methodologies, such as clinical trials, have seldom been applied and more pragmatic approaches are needed. In response, several academic centers such as researchers from the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London have initiated a digital health clinical simulation test bed to explore new approaches for evidence gathering relevant to solution type and maturity.

However, challenges in summarizing and representing patient data prevent widespread practice of scalable EHR-based stratification analysis. Here we present an unsupervised framework based on deep learning to process heterogeneous EHRs and derive patient representations that can efficiently and effectively enable patient stratification at scale. We considered EHRs of 1,608,741 patients from a diverse hospital cohort comprising a total of 57,464 clinical concepts. We introduce a representation learning model based on word embeddings, convolutional neural networks, and autoencoders (i.e., ConvAE) to transform patient trajectories into low-dimensional latent vectors. We evaluated these representations as broadly enabling patient stratification by applying hierarchical clustering to different multi-disease and disease-specific patient cohorts. ConvAE significantly outperformed several baselines in a clustering task to identify patients with different complex conditions, with 2.61 entropy and 0.31 purity average scores. When applied to stratify patients within a certain condition, ConvAE led to various clinically relevant subtypes for different disorders, including type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease, largely related to comorbidities, disease progression, and symptom severity. With these results, we demonstrate that ConvAE can generate patient representations that lead to clinically meaningful insights.

The mental health domain is particularly challenging, partly because clinical documentation relies heavily on free text that is difficult to de-identify completely. This problem could be tackled by using artificial medical data. In this work, we present an approach to generate artificial clinical documents. We apply this approach to discharge summaries from a large mental healthcare provider and discharge summaries from an intensive care unit. We perform an extensive intrinsic evaluation where we (1) apply several measures of text preservation; (2) measure how much the model memorises training data; and (3) estimate clinical validity of the generated text based on a human evaluation task. Furthermore, we perform an extrinsic evaluation by studying the impact of using artificial text in a downstream NLP text classification task. We found that using this artificial data as training data can lead to classification results that are comparable to the original results. Additionally, using only a small amount of information from the original data to condition the generation of the artificial data is successful, which holds promise for reducing the risk of these artificial data retaining rare information from the original data. This is an important finding for our long-term goal of being able to generate artificial clinical data that can be released to the wider research community and accelerate advances in developing computational methods that use healthcare data. © 2020, The Author(s).","Classification (of information); Clinical research; Health care; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Artificial data; Clinical documentation; Discharge summary; Health records; Language processing; Mental health; Natural languages; Processing method; Textual data; Training data; article; health care personnel; human; human experiment; intensive care unit; mental health; natural language processing; validity; Intensive care units","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088067580"

Early prediction of AKI could prompt preventive measures, but is challenging in the clinical routine. One important reason is that the amount of postoperative data is too massive and too high-dimensional to be effectively processed by the human operator. We therefore sought to develop a deep-learning-based algorithm that is able to predict postoperative AKI prior to the onset of symptoms and complications. Based on 96 routinely collected parameters we built a recurrent neural network (RNN) for real-time prediction of AKI after cardiothoracic surgery. From the data of 15,564 admissions we constructed a balanced training set (2224 admissions) for the development of the RNN. The model was then evaluated on an independent test set (350 admissions) and yielded an area under curve (AUC) (95% confidence interval) of 0.893 (0.862–0.924). We compared the performance of our model against that of experienced clinicians. The RNN significantly outperformed clinicians (AUC = 0.901 vs. 0.745, p < 0.001) and was overall well calibrated. This was not the case for the physicians, who systematically underestimated the risk (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the RNN was superior to physicians in the prediction of AKI after cardiothoracic surgery. It could potentially be integrated into hospitals’ electronic health records for real-time patient monitoring and may help to detect early AKI and hence modify the treatment in perioperative care. © 2020, The Author(s).","Forecasting; Patient monitoring; Surgery; Cardiothoracic surgery; Clinical routine; Early prediction; High-dimensional; Higher-dimensional; Human operator; Learning-based algorithms; Predictive performance; Preventive measures; Real-time prediction; acute kidney failure; adult; algorithm; Article; calibration; controlled study; deep learning; electronic health record; human; major clinical study; parameters; patient monitoring; perioperative period; physician; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; recurrent neural network; retrospective study; risk; thorax surgery; Recurrent neural networks","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094188187"

Our objective was to generate an algorithm termed “Suicide Artificial Intelligence Prediction Heuristic (SAIPH)” capable of predicting future risk to suicidal thought by analyzing publicly available Twitter data. We trained a series of neural networks on Twitter data queried against suicide associated psychological constructs including burden, stress, loneliness, hopelessness, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Using 512,526 tweets from N = 283 suicidal ideation (SI) cases and 3,518,494 tweets from 2655 controls, we then trained a random forest model using neural network outputs to predict binary SI status. The model predicted N = 830 SI events derived from an independent set of 277 suicidal ideators relative to N = 3159 control events in all non-SI individuals with an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI 0.86–0.90). Using an alternative approach, our model generates temporal prediction of risk such that peak occurrences above an individual specific threshold denote a ~7 fold increased risk for SI within the following 10 days (OR = 6.7 ± 1.1, P = 9 × 10−71). We validated our model using regionally obtained Twitter data and observed significant associations of algorithm SI scores with county-wide suicide death rates across 16 days in August and in October, 2019, most significantly in younger individuals. Algorithmic approaches like SAIPH have the potential to identify individual future SI risk and could be easily adapted as clinical decision tools aiding suicide screening and risk monitoring using available technologies. © 2020, The Author(s).","Decision trees; Machine learning; Random forests; Risk assessment; Social networking (online); Environmental influences; Independent set; Individual risks; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Random forest modeling; Social media datum; Suicidal ideation; Temporal prediction; adult; anxiety; Article; controlled study; depression; disease burden; female; hopelessness; human; insomnia; loneliness; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; priority journal; risk assessment; social media; stress; suicidal ideation; suicide; Forecasting","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088069409"

It is desirable for these datasets to serve four functions: (1) enabling the creation of clinically relevant algorithms; (2) facilitating like-for-like comparison of algorithmic performance; (3) ensuring reproducibility of algorithms; (4) asserting a normative influence on the clinical domains and diversity of patients that will potentially benefit from technological advances. Without benchmark datasets that satisfy these functions, it is impossible to address two perennial concerns of clinicians experienced in computational research: “the data scientists just go where the data is rather than where the needs are,” and, “yes, but will this work for my patients?” If algorithms are to be developed and applied for the care of patients, then it is prudent for the research community to create benchmark datasets proactively, across specialties. As yet, best practice in this area has not been defined. Broadly speaking, efforts will include design of the dataset; compliance and contracting issues relating to the sharing of sensitive data; enabling access and reuse; and planning for translation of algorithms to the clinical environment.

To date, there are a lack of high-efficiency glaucoma diagnostic tools based on visual fields (VFs). Herein, we develop and evaluate the performance of ‘iGlaucoma’, a smartphone application-based deep learning system (DLS) in detecting glaucomatous VF changes. A total of 1,614,808 data points of 10,784 VFs (5542 patients) from seven centers in China were included in this study, divided over two phases. In Phase I, 1,581,060 data points from 10,135 VFs of 5105 patients were included to train (8424 VFs), validate (598 VFs) and test (3 independent test sets—200, 406, 507 samples) the diagnostic performance of the DLS. In Phase II, using the same DLS, iGlaucoma cloud-based application further tested on 33,748 data points from 649 VFs of 437 patients from three glaucoma clinics. With reference to three experienced expert glaucomatologists, the diagnostic performance (area under curve [AUC], sensitivity and specificity) of the DLS and six ophthalmologists were evaluated in detecting glaucoma. In Phase I, the DLS outperformed all six ophthalmologists in the three test sets (AUC of 0.834–0.877, with a sensitivity of 0.831–0.922 and a specificity of 0.676–0.709).

A validated tool that addresses apps’ potentially important dimensions has not been available to patients and clinicians. The objective of this study was to develop and preliminarily assess a usable, valid, and open-source rating tool to objectively measure the risks and benefits of health apps. We accomplished this by using a Delphi process, where we constructed an app rating tool called THESIS that could promote informed app selection. We used a systematic process to select chronic disease apps with ≥4 stars and <4-stars and then rated them with THESIS to examine the tool’s interrater reliability and internal consistency. We rated 211 apps, finding they performed fair overall (3.02 out of 5 [95% CI, 2.96–3.09]), but especially poorly for privacy/security (2.21 out of 5 [95% CI, 2.11–2.32]), interoperability (1.75 [95% CI, 1.59–1.91]), and availability in multiple languages (1.43 out of 5 [95% CI, 1.30–1.56]). Ratings using THESIS had fair interrater reliability (κ = 0.3–0.6) and excellent scale reliability (ɑ = 0.85). Correlation with traditional star ratings was low (r = 0.24), suggesting THESIS captures issues beyond general user acceptance. Preliminary testing of THESIS suggests apps that serve patients with chronic disease could perform much better, particularly in privacy/security and interoperability. THESIS warrants further testing and may guide software and policymakers to further improve app performance, so apps can more consistently improve patient outcomes. © 2020, The Author(s).","Diseases; Health risks; mHealth; Open source software; Reliability; Risk assessment; Software testing; Stars; Chronic disease; Internal consistency; Interrater reliability; Lowest R; Mobile health application; Multiple languages; Open-source; Scale reliability; Star ratings; Systematic process; Article; chronic disease; Delphi study; internal consistency; interrater reliability; priority journal; risk benefit analysis; Application programs","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088065680"

The ability to collect continuous activity monitoring data with digital devices in real-world environments has opened unprecedented opportunity to establish clinical digital phenotypes across diseases. Many traditional assessments of physical function utilized in clinical trials are limited because they are episodic, therefore, cannot capture the day-to-day temporal fluctuations and longitudinal changes in activity that individuals experience. In order to understand the sensitivity of gait speed as a potential endpoint for clinical trials, we investigated the use of digital devices during traditional clinical assessments and in real-world environments in a group of healthy younger (n = 33, 18–40 years) and older (n = 32, 65–85 years) adults. We observed good agreement between gait speed estimated using a lumbar-mounted accelerometer and gold standard system during the performance of traditional gait assessment task in-lab, and saw discrepancies between in-lab and at-home gait speed. We found that gait speed estimated in-lab, with or without digital devices, failed to differentiate between the age groups, whereas gait speed derived during at-home monitoring was able to distinguish the age groups. Furthermore, we found that only three days of at-home monitoring was sufficient to reliably estimate gait speed in our population, and still capture age-related group differences. Our results suggest that gait speed derived from activities during daily life using data from wearable devices may have the potential to transform clinical trials by non-invasively and unobtrusively providing a more objective and naturalistic measure of functional ability. © 2020, The Author(s).","Speed; Wearable technology; Age groups; Clinical trial; Gait speed; Home monitoring; Human movements; Human physiology; Measurements of; Multi-modal; Real world environments; Technological advances; accelerometry; adult; aged; Article; clinical assessment; cross-sectional study; environmental factor; feature extraction; female; groups by age; home monitoring; human; lumbar region; magnetometry; male; normal human; priority journal; task performance; validity; walking speed; Digital devices","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091948257"

Whilst many are developed to address existing mental health problems, there is also potential for DHIs to address prevention and early intervention. However, there are currently limitations in the design and reporting of the development, evaluation and implementation of preventive DHIs that can limit their adoption into real-world practice. This scoping review aimed to examine existing evidence-based DHI interventions and review how well the research literature described factors that researchers need to include in their study designs and reports to support real-world implementation. A search was conducted for relevant publications published from 2013 onwards. Twenty-one different interventions were identified from 30 publications, which took a universal (n = 12), selective (n = 3) and indicative (n = 15) approach to preventing poor mental health. Most interventions targeted adolescents, with only two studies including children aged ≤10 years. There was limited reporting of user co-design involvement in intervention development. Barriers and facilitators to implementation varied across the delivery settings, and only a minority reported financial costs involved in delivering the intervention. This review found that while there are continued attempts to design and evaluate DHIs for children and young people, there are several points of concern. More research is needed with younger children and those from poorer and underserved backgrounds. Co-design processes with children and young people should be recognised and reported as a necessary component within DHI research as they are an important factor in the design and development of interventions, and underpin successful adoption and implementation. Reporting the type and level of human support provided as part of the intervention is also important in enabling the sustained use and implementation of DHIs. © 2020, The Author(s).","Health; Co-designs; Early intervention; Evidence-based; Health interventions; Mental health; Real-world implementation; Real-world practice; Scoping review; Study design; Young peoples; adolescent; child; health care delivery; human; mental disease; mental health; mental health service; preventive health service; priority journal; Review; study design; telehealth; Design","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092583244"

As the discipline has matured, individuals have called attention to aberrancies in the output of these algorithms. In particular, criticisms have been widely circulated that algorithmically developed models may have limited generalizability due to overfitting to the training data and may systematically perpetuate various forms of biases inherent in the training data, including race, gender, age, and health state or fitness level (Challen et al.

Prompt diagnosis and immediate treatment are critical to avoid high morbidity and mortality rates, yet PE remains among the diagnoses most frequently missed or delayed. In this study, we developed a deep learning model—PENet, to automatically detect PE on volumetric CTPA scans as an end-to-end solution for this purpose. The PENet is a 77-layer 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) pretrained on the Kinetics-600 dataset and fine-tuned on a retrospective CTPA dataset collected from a single academic institution. The PENet model performance was evaluated in detecting PE on data from two different institutions: one as a hold-out dataset from the same institution as the training data and a second collected from an external institution to evaluate model generalizability to an unrelated population dataset. PENet achieved an AUROC of 0.84 [0.82–0.87] on detecting PE on the hold out internal test set and 0.85 [0.81–0.88] on external dataset. PENet also outperformed current state-of-the-art 3D CNN models. The results represent successful application of an end-to-end 3D CNN model for the complex task of PE diagnosis without requiring computationally intensive and time consuming preprocessing and demonstrates sustained performance on data from an external institution. Our model could be applied as a triage tool to automatically identify clinically important PEs allowing for prioritization for diagnostic radiology interpretation and improved care pathways via more efficient diagnosis. © 2020, The Author(s).","3D modeling; Computerized tomography; Deep learning; Diseases; Learning systems; Neural network models; Population statistics; Statistical tests; Three dimensional computer graphics; Automated diagnosis; Clinical problems; Convolutional neural network; CT imaging; Gold standards; Learning models; Mortality rate; Neural network model; Pulmonary embolism; Volumetric CT; adult; aged; Article; automation; comparative study; cone beam computed tomography; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; entropy; female; human; interrater reliability; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; predictive value; prevalence; priority journal; radiodiagnosis; sensitivity and specificity; three-dimensional imaging; Convolutional neural networks","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088415147"

In order to effectively prevent these complications, high-risk patients must be readily identified. However, most current risk scores are designed to predict a single postoperative complication and often lack specificity on the patient level. In other fields, machine learning (ML) has been shown to successfully create models to predict multiple end points using a single input feature set. We hypothesized that ML can be used to create models to predict postoperative mortality, AKI, reintubation, and a combined outcome using a single set of features available at the end of surgery. A set of 46 features available at the end of surgery, including drug dosing, blood loss, vital signs, and others were extracted. Additionally, six additional features accounting for total intraoperative hypotension were extracted and trialed for different models. A total of 59,981 surgical procedures met inclusion criteria and the deep neural networks (DNN) were trained on 80% of the data, with 20% reserved for testing. The network performances were then compared to ASA Physical Status. In addition to creating separate models for each outcome, a multitask learning model was trialed that used information on all outcomes to predict the likelihood of each outcome individually. The overall rate of the examined complications in this data set was 0.79% for mortality, 22.3% (of 21,676 patients with creatinine values) for AKI, and 1.1% for reintubation. Overall, there was significant overlap between the various model types for each outcome, with no one modeling technique consistently performing the best. However, the best DNN models did beat the ASA score for all outcomes other than mortality. The highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) models were 0.792 (0.775–0.808) for AKI, 0.879 (0.851–0.905) for reintubation, 0.907 (0.872–0.938) for mortality, and 0.874 (0.864–0.866) for any outcome. The ASA score alone achieved AUCs of 0.652 (0.636–0.669) for AKI, 0.787 (0.757–0.818) for reintubation, 0.839 (0.804–0.875) for mortality, and 0.76 (0.748–0.773) for any outcome. Overall, the DNN architecture was able to create models that outperformed the ASA physical status to predict all outcomes based on a single feature set, consisting of objective data available at the end of surgery.

In this study, we developed a deep learning-based assistant to help pathologists differentiate between two subtypes of primary liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, on hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images (WSI), and evaluated its effect on the diagnostic performance of 11 pathologists with varying levels of expertise. Our model achieved accuracies of 0.885 on a validation set of 26 WSI, and 0.842 on an independent test set of 80 WSI. Although use of the assistant did not change the mean accuracy of the 11 pathologists (p = 0.184, OR = 1.281), it significantly improved the accuracy (p = 0.045, OR = 1.499) of a subset of nine pathologists who fell within well-defined experience levels (GI subspecialists, non-GI subspecialists, and trainees). In the assisted state, model accuracy significantly impacted the diagnostic decisions of all 11 pathologists. As expected, when the model’s prediction was correct, assistance significantly improved accuracy (p = 0.000, OR = 4.289), whereas when the model’s prediction was incorrect, assistance significantly decreased accuracy (p = 0.000, OR = 0.253), with both effects holding across all pathologist experience levels and case difficulty levels. Our results highlight the challenges of translating AI models into the clinical setting, and emphasize the importance of taking into account potential unintended negative consequences of model assistance when designing and testing medical AI-assistance tools. © 2020, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Diagnosis; formaldehyde; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Cholangiocarcinoma; Clinical tasks; Clinical workflow; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Human performance; Learning assistant; Liver cancers; Primary liver cancers; Whole slide images; adult; aged; Article; bile duct carcinoma; cancer classification; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; differential diagnosis; evaluation study; experimental design; female; histopathology; human; human tissue; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; paraffin embedding; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; Diseases","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085655108"

However, most telementoring platforms are not designed to assist in austere, pre-hospital settings. This paper evaluates the system for telementoring with augmented reality (STAR), a portable and self-contained telementoring platform based on an augmented reality head-mounted display (ARHMD). The system is designed to assist in austere scenarios: a stabilized first-person view of the operating field is sent to a remote expert, who creates surgical instructions that a local first responder wearing the ARHMD can visualize as three-dimensional models projected onto the patient’s body. Our hypothesis evaluated whether remote guidance with STAR could lead to performing a surgical procedure better, as opposed to remote audio-only guidance. Remote expert surgeons guided first responders through training cricothyroidotomies in a simulated austere scenario, and on-site surgeons evaluated the participants using standardized evaluation tools. The evaluation comprehended completion time and technique performance of specific cricothyroidotomy steps. The analyses were also performed considering the participants’ years of experience as first responders, and their experience performing cricothyroidotomies. A linear mixed model analysis showed that using STAR was associated with higher procedural and non-procedural scores, and overall better performance. Additionally, a binary logistic regression analysis showed that using STAR was associated to safer and more successful executions of cricothyroidotomies. This work demonstrates that remote mentors can use STAR to provide first responders with guidance and surgical knowledge, and represents a first step towards the adoption of ARHMDs to convey clinical expertise remotely in austere scenarios. © 2020, The Author(s).","Helmet mounted displays; Regression analysis; Stars; Surgery; First person; First responders; Head-mounted-displays; Hospital settings; Operating fields; Performance; Remote experts; Remote guidance; Telementoring; Three dimensional modelling; adult; Article; augmented reality; controlled study; female; human; male; mentoring; priority journal; rating scale; surgeon; telementoring; tracheotomy; work experience; Augmented reality","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087848610"

Objective measurement tools, specifically, wearable sensors, present the opportunity to minimize the major limitations of self-reported eating measures by generating supplementary sensor data that can improve the validity of self-report data in naturalistic settings. This scoping review summarizes the current use of wearable devices/sensors that automatically detect eating-related activity in naturalistic research settings. Five databases were searched in December 2019, and 618 records were retrieved from the literature search. This scoping review included N = 40 studies (from 33 articles) that reported on one or more wearable sensors used to automatically detect eating activity in the field. The majority of studies (N = 26, 65%) used multi-sensor systems (incorporating > 1 wearable sensors), and accelerometers were the most commonly utilized sensor (N = 25, 62.5%). All studies (N = 40, 100.0%) used either self-report or objective ground-truth methods to validate the inferred eating activity detected by the sensor(s). The most frequently reported evaluation metrics were Accuracy (N = 12) and F1-score (N = 10). This scoping review highlights the current state of wearable sensors’ ability to improve upon traditional eating assessment methods by passively detecting eating activity in naturalistic settings, over long periods of time, and with minimal user interaction. A key challenge in this field, wide variation in eating outcome measures and evaluation metrics, demonstrates the need for the development of a standardized form of comparability among sensors/multi-sensor systems and multidisciplinary collaboration. © 2020, The Author(s).","'current; Chronic disease; Detection approach; Dietary intakes; Eating behavior; Evaluation metrics; Health research; In-field; Multi-sensor systems; Scoping review; data base; eating; medical research; priority journal; public health; Review; self report; Wearable sensors","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087153152"

In such situations, evidence generated from similar patients’ data captured in electronic health records (EHRs) can aid decision making. However, challenges in generating and making such evidence available have prevented its on-demand use to inform patient care. We propose that a specialty consultation service staffed by a team of medical and informatics experts can rapidly summarize ‘what happened to patients like mine’ using data from the EHR and other health data sources. By emulating a familiar physician workflow, and keeping experts in the loop, such a service can translate physician inquiries about situations with evidence gaps into actionable reports. The demand for and benefits gained from such a consult service will naturally vary by practice type and data robustness. However, we cannot afford to miss the opportunity to use the patient data captured every day via EHR systems to close the evidence gap between available clinical guidelines and realities of clinical practice. We have begun offering such a service to physicians at our academic medical center and believe that such a service should be core offering by clinical informatics professional throughout the country. Only if we launch such efforts broadly can we systematically study the utility of learning from the record of routine clinical practice. © 2019, The Author(s).","Hospital data processing; Medical informatics; Clinical practices; Consultation services; Decisions makings; Electronic health; Health records; Learn+; On demands; Patient care; Patient data; Treatment guidelines; adult; consultation; electronic health record; human; information science; learning; patient coding; practice guideline; review; university hospital; workflow; Decision making","Nature Publishing Group","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126657870"

Beyond the 48 studies using AI/ML for LBP classification, no studies examined use of AI/ML in prognosis prediction of specific sub-groups, and AI/ML techniques are yet to be implemented in guiding LBP treatment. In contrast, the STarT Back tool has been assessed for internal consistency, test−retest reliability, validity, pain and disability prognosis, and influence on pain and disability treatment outcomes. McKenzie has been assessed for inter- and intra-tester reliability, prognosis, and impact on pain and disability outcomes relative to other treatments. For AI/ML methods to contribute to the refinement of LBP (sub-)classification and guide treatment allocation, large data sets containing known and exploratory clinical features should be examined. There is also a need to establish reliability, validity, and prognostic capacity of AI/ML techniques in LBP as well as its ability to inform treatment allocation for improved patient outcomes and/or reduced healthcare costs. © 2020, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Patient treatment; Reliability; Artificial intelligence learning; Back pain; Classification approach; Clinical characteristics; Clinical classification; Lesson learnt; Lower back pain; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Systematic Review; artificial intelligence; clinical classification; construct validity; disability; discriminant validity; human; internal consistency; low back pain; machine learning; outcome assessment; prediction; priority journal; prognosis; Review; sample size; systematic review; test retest reliability; treatment outcome; Classification (of information)","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087881437"

Therefore, predictive risk stratification models play an important role in clinical decision making. Determining whether a given predictive model is suitable for clinical use usually involves evaluating the model’s performance on large patient datasets using standard statistical measures of success (e.g., accuracy, discriminatory ability). However, as these metrics correspond to averages over patients who have a range of different characteristics, it is difficult to discern whether an individual prediction on a given patient should be trusted using these measures alone. In this paper, we introduce a new method for identifying patient subgroups where a predictive model is expected to be poor, thereby highlighting when a given prediction is misleading and should not be trusted. The resulting “unreliability score” can be computed for any clinical risk model and is suitable in the setting of large class imbalance, a situation often encountered in healthcare settings. Using data from more than 40,000 patients in the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE), we demonstrate that patients with high unreliability scores form a subgroup in which the predictive model has both decreased accuracy and decreased discriminatory ability. © 2020, The Author(s).","Decision making; Large dataset; Risk assessment; Adverse outcomes; Clinical care; Clinical decision making; Clinical risks; Clinical use; Patient datasets; Performance; Predictive models; Risk modeling; Risk stratification; adult; article; female; Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events; human; major clinical study; male; prediction; Forecasting","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086522987"

In this multi-center randomized controlled trial, we tested the efficacy of a novel digital therapy for smoking cessation: the “CureApp Smoking Cessation (CASC)” system, including a CASC smartphone app, a web-based patient management PC software for primary physicians, and a mobile exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) checker. A total of 584 participants with nicotine dependence were recruited from October 2017 to January 2018, and allocated 1:1 to the CASC intervention group or the control group. Both groups received a standard smoking cessation treatment with pharmacotherapy and counseling for 12 weeks. Meanwhile, the intervention group used the CASC system, and the control group used a control-app without a mobile CO checker, each for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the biochemically validated continuous abstinence rate (CAR) from weeks 9 to 24. The main secondary outcome was an extended CAR from weeks 9 to 52. Except for 12 participants who did not download or use the apps, 285 participants were assigned to the intervention group, and 287, to the control. CAR from weeks 9 to 24 in the intervention group was significantly higher than that in the control group (63.9% vs. 50.5%; odds ratio [OR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24 to 2.42; P = 0.001).

However, evidence indicates that such algorithms have the potential to worsen disparities currently intrinsic to the contemporary healthcare system, including racial biases. Blame for these deficiencies has often been placed on the algorithm—but the underlying training data bears greater responsibility for these errors, as biased outputs are inexorably produced by biased inputs. The utility, equity, and generalizability of predictive models depend on population-representative training data with robust feature sets. So while the conventional paradigm of big data is deductive in nature—clinical decision support—a future model harnesses the potential of big data for inductive reasoning. This may be conceptualized as clinical decision questioning, intended to liberate the human predictive process from preconceived lenses in data solicitation and/or interpretation. Efficacy, representativeness and generalizability are all heightened in this schema. Thus, the possible risks of biased big data arising from the inputs themselves must be acknowledged and addressed. Awareness of data deficiencies, structures for data inclusiveness, strategies for data sanitation, and mechanisms for data correction can help realize the potential of big data for a personalized medicine era.

Here, we describe an algorithm to predict DR progression by means of deep learning (DL), using as input color fundus photographs (CFPs) acquired at a single visit from a patient with DR. The proposed DL models were designed to predict future DR progression, defined as 2-step worsening on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale, and were trained against DR severity scores assessed after 6, 12, and 24 months from the baseline visit by masked, well-trained, human reading center graders. The performance of one of these models (prediction at month 12) resulted in an area under the curve equal to 0.79. Interestingly, our results highlight the importance of the predictive signal located in the peripheral retinal fields, not routinely collected for DR assessments, and the importance of microvascular abnormalities. Our findings show the feasibility of predicting future DR progression by leveraging CFPs of a patient acquired at a single visit. Upon further development on larger and more diverse datasets, such an algorithm could enable early diagnosis and referral to a retina specialist for more frequent monitoring and even consideration of early intervention. Moreover, it could also improve patient recruitment for clinical trials targeting DR. © 2019, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Diagnosis; Eye protection; Forecasting; Areas under the curves; Color fundus photograph; Diabetic retinopathy; Further development; Learning models; Microvascular; Model prediction; Performance; Predictive signals; Vision loss; algorithm; Article; deep learning; diabetic macular edema; diabetic retinopathy; disease exacerbation; disease severity; human; major clinical study; microaneurysm; ophthalmoscopy; optic nerve; outcome variable; priority journal; retrospective study; transfer of learning; visual field; Learning algorithms","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097310832"

We here investigate the use of patient-generated health data and data-driven phenotyping to characterize endometriosis patient subtypes, based on their reported signs and symptoms. We aim at unsupervised learning of endometriosis phenotypes using self-tracking data from personal smartphones. We leverage data from an observational research study of over 4000 women with endometriosis that track their condition over more than 2 years. We extend a classical mixed-membership model to accommodate the idiosyncrasies of the data at hand, i.e., the multimodality and uncertainty of the self-tracked variables. The proposed method, by jointly modeling a wide range of observations (i.e., participant symptoms, quality of life, treatments), identifies clinically relevant endometriosis subtypes. Experiments show that our method is robust to different hyperparameter choices and the biases of self-tracking data (e.g., the wide variations in tracking frequency among participants). With this work, we show the promise of unsupervised learning of endometriosis subtypes from self-tracked data, as learned phenotypes align well with what is already known about the disease, but also suggest new clinically actionable findings. More generally, we argue that a continued research effort on unsupervised phenotyping methods with patient-generated health data via new mobile and digital technologies will have significant impact on the study of enigmatic diseases in particular, and health in general. © 2020, The Author(s).","Health; narcotic analgesic agent; Chronic conditions; Data driven; Health data; Observational research; Phenotyping; Research studies; Self-tracking; Smart phones; Tracking data; Women of child-bearing ages; abdominal surgery; adult; anxiety disorder; Article; bloating; body mass; chronic fatigue syndrome; clinical feature; colonoscopy; constipation; daily life activity; diarrhea; disease severity; dizziness; dyspareunia; endometriosis; fatigue; female; gastrointestinal pain; headache; hot flush; human; hypertension; interstitial cystitis; laparoscopy; low back pain; major clinical study; male; medical record; menstrual irregularity; menstruation; migraine; mobile application; nausea; neuropathic pain; ovary polycystic disease; pain severity; paresthesia; patient advocacy; pelvic inflammatory disease; pelvic pain; phenotype; practice guideline; priority journal; quality of life; sexual behavior; sigmoidoscopy; sinus congestion; social media; spotting; vagina pain; Unsupervised learning","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087533745"

GPs prioritised eight from more than 80 potential interventions to increase GP discussion of PA with patients. Following a 2-week baseline, a multi-arm bandit algorithm was used to assign optimal strategies to GP clinics with the target outcome being GP PA discussion rates. The algorithm was updated weekly and the process iterated until the more promising strategies emerged (a duration of seven weeks). The top three performing strategies were continued for 3 weeks to improve the power of the hypothesis test of effectiveness for each strategy compared to baseline. GPs recorded a total of 11,176 conversations about PA. GPs identified 15 factors affecting GP PA discussion rates with patients including GP skills and awareness, fragmentation of care and fear of adverse outcomes. The two most effective strategies were correctly identified within seven weeks of the algorithm-based assignment of strategies.

In this manuscript, we focus on how Electronic Medical Records in particular can be managed by Blockchain, and how the introduction of this novel technology can create a more efficient and interoperable infrastructure to manage records that leads to improved healthcare outcomes, while maintaining patient data ownership and without compromising privacy or security of sensitive data. © 2020, The Author(s).","Distributed ledger; Health care; Hospital data processing; Information management; Interoperability; Laws and legislation; Medical computing; Sensitive data; Block-chain; Britain; Data ownership; Health outcomes; Healthcare systems; IMPROVE-A; Medical data; Medical record; Medical records systems; Record management; adult; electronic medical record; Great Britain; health care system; human; medical record; privacy; review; Blockchain","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079571346"

The challenge is to “push” content at algorithmically chosen moments without making users trigger it with effortful input. We trained a randomForest algorithm to predict heroin craving, cocaine craving, or stress (reported via smartphone app 3x/day) 90 min into the future, using 16 weeks of field data from 189 outpatients being treated for opioid-use disorder. We used only one form of continuous input (along with person-level demographic data), collected passively: an indicator of environmental exposures along the past 5 h of movement, as assessed by GPS. Our models achieved excellent overall accuracy—as high as 0.93 by the end of 16 weeks of tailoring—but this was driven mostly by correct predictions of absence. For predictions of presence, “believability” (positive predictive value, PPV) usually peaked in the high 0.70s toward the end of the 16 weeks. When the prediction target was more rare, PPV was lower. Our findings complement those of other investigators who use machine learning with more broadly based “digital phenotyping” inputs to predict or detect mental and behavioral events. When target events are comparatively subtle, like stress or drug craving, accurate detection or prediction probably needs effortful input from users, not passive monitoring alone. We discuss ways in which accuracy is difficult to achieve or even assess, and warn that high overall accuracy (including high specificity) can mask the abundance of false alarms that low PPV reveals. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Smartphones; buprenorphine; cocaine; diamorphine; methadone; Continuous input; Field data; GPS data; Just-in-time; Learn+; Opioids; Overall accuracies; Positive predictive values; Smartphone apps; User need; Addiction Severity Index; adult; African American; algorithm; Article; demography; diagnostic accuracy; drug craving; DSM-IV; environmental exposure; European American; female; global positioning system; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; opiate addiction; phenotype; predictive value; prevalence; priority journal; randomforest algorithm; sensitivity and specificity; simulation; stress; Forecasting","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087527047"

There are many instances, as we detail in this paper, where a single term is used by different groups to mean different things, as well as cases where multiple terms are used to describe essentially the same concept. Our intent is to clarify core terminology and best practices for the evaluation of Biometric Monitoring Technologies (BioMeTs), without unnecessarily introducing new terms. We focus on the evaluation of BioMeTs as fit-for-purpose for use in clinical trials. However, our intent is for this framework to be instructional to all users of digital measurement tools, regardless of setting or intended use. We propose and describe a three-component framework intended to provide a foundational evaluation framework for BioMeTs. This framework includes (1) verification, (2) analytical validation, and (3) clinical validation.

This study proposes a process, focused on practical usability, for translating RCT data into personalized treatment recommendations that weighs benefits against harms and integrates subjective perceptions of relative severity. Intensive blood pressure treatment (IBPT) was selected as the test case to demonstrate the suggested process, which was divided into three phases: (1) Prediction models were developed using the Systolic Blood-Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) data for benefits and adverse events of IBPT. The models were externally validated using retrospective Clalit Health Services (CHS) data; (2) Predicted risk reductions and increases from these models were used to create a yes/no IBPT recommendation by calculating a severity-weighted benefit-to-harm ratio; (3) Analysis outputs were summarized in a decision support tool. Based on the individual benefit-to-harm ratios, 62 and 84% of the SPRINT and CHS populations, respectively, would theoretically be recommended IBPT. The original SPRINT trial results of significant decrease in cardiovascular outcomes following IBPT persisted only in the group that received a “yes-treatment” recommendation by the suggested process, while the rate of serious adverse events was slightly higher in the ""no-treatment"" recommendation group. This process can be used to translate RCT data into individualized recommendations by identifying patients for whom the treatment’s benefits outweigh the harms, while considering subjective views of perceived severity of the different outcomes. The proposed approach emphasizes clinical practicality by mimicking physicians’ clinical decision-making process and integrating all recommendation outputs into a usable decision support tool. © 2019, The Author(s).","Blood; Decision making; Decision support systems; Health risks; Patient treatment; Risk assessment; Adverse events; Clinical trial; Decision supports; Health services; Personalized recommendation; Population levels; Pressure treatments; Support tool; Systolic blood pressure; Treatment effects; age; aged; all cause mortality; Article; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure regulation; cardiovascular disease; clinical decision making; clinical decision support system; clinical trial (topic); disease severity; female; human; intensive care; major clinical study; male; personalized medicine; priority journal; risk benefit analysis; sex difference; systolic blood pressure; Blood pressure","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104074131"

The encapsulated accelerometer contact microphone (ACM) utilizes nano-gap transducers to achieve extraordinary sensitivity in a wide bandwidth (DC-12 kHz) with high dynamic range.

Here, we studied multiple sclerosis (MS) as a model neurological disease for investigating physiometric and environmental signals. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and correlation of wearable biosensors with traditional clinical measures of disability both in clinic and in free-living in MS patients. This is a single site observational cohort study conducted at an academic neurological center specializing in MS. A cohort of 25 MS patients with varying disability scores were recruited. Patients were monitored in clinic while wearing biosensors at nine body locations at three separate visits. Biosensor-derived features including aspects of gait (stance time, turn angle, mean turn velocity) and balance were collected, along with standardized disability scores assessed by a neurologist. Participants also wore up to three sensors on the wrist, ankle, and sternum for 8 weeks as they went about their daily lives. The primary outcomes were feasibility, adherence, as well as correlation of biosensor-derived metrics with traditional neurologist-assessed clinical measures of disability. We used machine-learning algorithms to extract multiple features of motion and dexterity and correlated these measures with more traditional measures of neurological disability, including the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and the MS functional composite-4 (MSFC-4). In free-living, sleep measures were additionally collected. Twenty-three subjects completed the first two of three in-clinic study visits and the 8-week free-living biosensor period. Several biosensor-derived features significantly correlated with EDSS and MSFC-4 scores derived at visit two, including mobility stance time with MSFC-4 z-score (Spearman correlation −0.546; p = 0.0070), several aspects of turning including turn angle (0.437; p = 0.0372), and maximum angular velocity (0.653; p = 0.0007). Similar correlations were observed at subsequent clinic visits, and in the free-living setting. We also found other passively collected signals, including measures of sleep, that correlated with disease severity. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of applying passive biosensor measurement techniques to monitor disability in MS patients both in clinic and in the free-living setting. © 2019, The Author(s).","Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Neurology; Clinical measure; Derived features; Free livings; Functional composites; Multiple sclerosis; Neurological disease; Phenotyping; Stance time; Technological advances; Turn angle; accelerometry; adult; ankle; Article; clinical article; cohort analysis; deep neural network; dexterity test; disease severity; Expanded Disability Status Scale; feasibility study; feature extraction; female; heart rate variability; human; longitudinal study; male; maximum angular velocity; middle aged; multiple sclerosis; Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite 4; nervous system parameters; neurologic disease assessment; neurologist; observational study; outcome assessment; patient compliance; priority journal; processing speed; prospective study; psychomotor vigilance task; REM sleep; sleep quality; stance time; sternum; timed up and go test; turn angle; wrist; Biosensors","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135599833"

Treatment recommendations are predictions with an inherently causal interpretation. To use deep learning for these applications in the setting of observational data, deep learning methods must be made compatible with the required causal assumptions. We present a scenario with real-world medical images (CT-scans of lung cancer) and simulated outcome data. Through the data simulation scheme, the images contain two distinct factors of variation that are associated with survival, but represent a collider (tumor size) and a prognostic factor (tumor heterogeneity), respectively. When a deep network would use all the information available in the image to predict survival, it would condition on the collider and thereby introduce bias in the estimation of the treatment effect. We show that when this collider can be quantified, unbiased individual prognosis predictions are attainable with deep learning. This is achieved by (1) setting a dual task for the network to predict both the outcome and the collider and (2) enforcing a form of linear independence of the activation distributions of the last layer. Our method provides an example of combining deep learning and structural causal models to achieve unbiased individual prognosis predictions. Extensions of machine learning methods for applications to causal questions are required to attain the long-standing goal of personalized medicine supported by artificial intelligence. © 2019, The Author(s).","Biological organs; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Forecasting; Medical imaging; Tumors; CT-scan; Data simulation; Image-analysis; Learning methods; Lung Cancer; Observational data; Prognosis prediction; Prognostic factors; Real-world; Tumor size; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; causal model; clinical outcome; controlled study; deep learning; human; image analysis; lung cancer; machine learning; priority journal; x-ray computed tomography; Computerized tomography","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135599317"

We studied the feasibility and acceptability of smartphone application (app)-based PMR for migraine in a neurology setting, explored whether app-based PMR might reduce headache (HA) days, and examined potential predictors of app and/or PMR use. In this single-arm pilot study, adults with ICHD3 migraine, 4+ HA days/month, a smartphone, and no prior behavioral migraine therapy in the past year were asked to complete a daily HA diary and do PMR for 20 min/day for 90 days. Outcomes were: adherence to PMR (no. and duration of audio plays) and frequency of diary use. Predictors in the models were baseline demographics, HA-specific variables, baseline PROMIS (patient-reported outcomes measurement information system) depression and anxiety scores, presence of overlapping pain conditions studied and app satisfaction scores at time of enrollment. Fifty-one patients enrolled (94% female). Mean age was 39 ± 13 years. The majority (63%) had severe migraine disability at baseline (MIDAS). PMR was played 22 ± 21 days on average. Mean/session duration was 11 ± 7 min. About half (47%) of uses were 1+ time/week and 35% of uses were 2+ times/week. There was a decline in use/week. On average, high users (PMR 2+ days/week in the first month) had 4 fewer days of reported HAs in month 2 vs. month 1, whereas low PMR users (PMR < 2 days/week in the first month) had only 2 fewer HA days in month 2. PROMIS depression score was negatively associated with the log odds of using the diary at least once (vs. no activity) in a week (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = [0.55, 0.85]) and of doing the PMR at least once in a week (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = [0.68, 0.91]). PROMIS anxiety was positively associated with using the diary at least once every week (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = [1.09, 1.73]) and with doing the PMR at least once every week (OR = 1.14 [95% CI = [1.02, 1.31]). In conclusion, about half of participants used smartphone-based PMR intervention based upon a brief, initial introduction to the app. App use was associated with reduction in HA days. Higher depression scores were negatively associated with diary and PMR use, whereas higher anxiety scores were positively associated. © 2019, The Author(s).","mHealth; Audio frequencies; Audio plays; Evidence-based; Measurement information; Mental health; Muscle relaxation; Patient-reported outcomes; Pilot studies; Smart phones; Smart-phone applications; adult; aged; arthritis; Article; backache; behavior therapy; chronic pain; feasibility study; female; fibromyalgia; follow up; headache; human; irritable colon; major clinical study; male; migraine; muscle relaxation; patient-reported outcome; pilot study; prediction; priority journal; progressive muscle relaxation; scoring system; Smartphones","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135598067"

A variety of strategies have been relied upon including questionnaires, motor diaries, and the serial administration of structured clinical exams like part III of the MDS-UPDRS. To evaluate the potential use of mobile and wearable technologies in clinical trials of new pharmacotherapies targeting PD symptoms, we carried out a project (project BlueSky) encompassing four clinical studies, in which 60 healthy volunteers (aged 23–69; 33 females) and 95 people with PD (aged 42–80; 37 females; years since diagnosis 1–24 years; Hoehn and Yahr 1–3) participated and were monitored in either a laboratory environment, a simulated apartment, or at home and in the community. In this paper, we investigated (i) the utility and reliability of self-reports for describing motor fluctuations; (ii) the agreement between participants and clinical raters on the presence of motor complications; (iii) the ability of video raters to accurately assess motor symptoms, and (iv) the dynamics of tremor, dyskinesia, and bradykinesia as they evolve over the medication cycle. Future papers will explore methods for estimating symptom severity based on sensor data. We found that 38% of participants who were asked to complete an electronic motor diary at home missed ~25% of total possible entries and otherwise made entries with an average delay of >4 h. During clinical evaluations by PD specialists, self-reports of dyskinesia were marked by ~35% false negatives and 15% false positives. Compared with live evaluation, the video evaluation of part III of the MDS-UPDRS significantly underestimated the subtle features of tremor and extremity bradykinesia, suggesting that these aspects of the disease may be underappreciated during remote assessments. On the other hand, live and video raters agreed on aspects of postural instability and gait. Our results highlight the significant opportunity for objective, high-resolution, continuous monitoring afforded by wearable technology to improve upon the monitoring of PD symptoms. © 2020, The Author(s).","Diagnosis; mHealth; Surveys; catechol methyltransferase inhibitor; cholinergic receptor blocking agent; levodopa; monoamine oxidase B inhibitor; Average delay; Clinical management; Clinical study; Clinical trial; Disease symptoms; Electronic motors; Healthy volunteers; Laboratory environment; Motor fluctuations; Sensors data; adult; aged; Article; bradykinesia; clinical evaluation; controlled study; daily life activity; dyskinesia; false negative result; false positive result; female; gait; Hoehn and Yahr scale; human; major clinical study; male; motor dysfunction; Parkinson disease; priority journal; self report; tremor; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; Wearable technology","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084120333"

There is a critical need for time- and cost-efficient strategies to analyze and interpret these data to advance human health. The recent rise of machine learning as a powerful technique to integrate multimodality, multifidelity data, and reveal correlations between intertwined phenomena presents a special opportunity in this regard. However, machine learning alone ignores the fundamental laws of physics and can result in ill-posed problems or non-physical solutions. Multiscale modeling is a successful strategy to integrate multiscale, multiphysics data and uncover mechanisms that explain the emergence of function. However, multiscale modeling alone often fails to efficiently combine large datasets from different sources and different levels of resolution. Here we demonstrate that machine learning and multiscale modeling can naturally complement each other to create robust predictive models that integrate the underlying physics to manage ill-posed problems and explore massive design spaces. We review the current literature, highlight applications and opportunities, address open questions, and discuss potential challenges and limitations in four overarching topical areas: ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, data-driven approaches, and theory-driven approaches. Towards these goals, we leverage expertise in applied mathematics, computer science, computational biology, biophysics, biomechanics, engineering mechanics, experimentation, and medicine. Our multidisciplinary perspective suggests that integrating machine learning and multiscale modeling can provide new insights into disease mechanisms, help identify new targets and treatment strategies, and inform decision making for the benefit of human health. © 2019, The Author(s).","Behavioral research; Computation theory; Decision making; Health; Large dataset; Multiphysics; Ordinary differential equations; Behavioral science; Biological science; Biomedical science; Breakthrough technology; Human health; Ill posed problem; Integrating machines; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Multiscale modeling; behavioral science; big data; biomedicine; biophysics; human; machine learning; priority journal; Review; theory; Machine learning","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135599036"

For outpatient care as well as general health monitoring, there is great interest in being able to accurately and frequently measure BP outside of a clinical setting, using mobile or wearable devices. One possible solution is photoplethysmography (PPG), which is most commonly used in pulse oximetry in clinical settings for measuring oxygen saturation. PPG technology is becoming more readily available, inexpensive, convenient, and easily integrated into portable devices. Recent advances include the development of smartphones and wearable devices that collect pulse oximeter signals.

By enabling patients and healthy consumers access to continuous measurements of health, wearable devices and digital medicine stand to realize highly personalized and preventative care.

Here we propose to integrate data from biohealth smartphone applications with continuous metabolic phenotypes derived from urine metabolites. This combination of molecular phenotypes with quantitative measurements of lifestyle reflect the biological consequences of human behavior in real time. We present data from an observational study involving two healthy subjects and discuss the challenges, opportunities, and implications of integrating this new layer of physiological information into digital medicine.

They lead to increased medical care costs, lengthened hospital stays, more litigation, and even death. Existing methods and technology to address this problem mostly focus on stratifying inpatients at risk, without predicting fall severity or injuries. Here, a retrospective cohort study was designed and performed to predict the severity of inpatient falls, based on a machine learning classifier integrating multi-view ensemble learning and model-based missing data imputation method. As input, over two thousand inpatient fall patients’ demographic characteristics, diagnoses, procedural data, and bone density measurements were retrieved from the HMH clinical data warehouse from two separate time periods. The predictive classifier developed based on multi-view ensemble learning with missing values (MELMV) outperformed other three baseline models; achieved a cross-validated AUC of 0.713 (95% CI, 0.701–0.725), an AUC of 0.808 (95% CI, 0.740–0.876) on the separate testing set. Our studies show the efficacy of integrative machine-learning based classifier model in dealing with multi-source patient data, which in this case delivers robust predictive performance on the severity of patient falls. The severe fall index provided by the MELMV classifier is calculated to identify inpatients who are at risk of having severe injuries if they fall, thus triggering additional steps of intervention to prevent a harmful fall, beyond the standard-of-care procedure for all high-risk fall patients. © 2019, The Author(s).","Classification (of information); Data warehouses; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Hospital data processing; Hospitals; Laws and legislation; Patient treatment; Cohort studies; Ensemble learning; Ensemble models; Learning classifiers; Machine-learning; Missing values; Model-based OPC; Multi-views; Patient safety; Safety problems; accident prevention; accidental injury; adult; area under the curve; Article; bone density; bone mass; clinical decision support system; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; demography; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fall risk; falling; female; hospital patient; human; injury severity; machine learning; major clinical study; male; multi view ensemble learning with missing value; natural language processing; patient coding; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; random forest; retrospective study; support vector machine; Machine learning","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100560308"

Recent works, however, have brought to light the importance of another aspect of sleep: bedtime regularity, given its ties to cognitive and metabolic health outcomes. To further our understanding of this often-neglected component of sleep, the objective of this work was to investigate the association between bedtime regularity and resting heart rate (RHR): an important biomarker for cardiovascular health. Utilizing Fitbit Charge HRs to measure bedtimes, sleep and RHR, 255,736 nights of data were collected from a cohort of 557 college students. We observed that going to bed even 30 minutes later than one’s normal bedtime was associated with a significantly higher RHR throughout sleep (Coeff +0.18; 95% CI: +0.11, +0.26 bpm), persisting into the following day and converging with one’s normal RHR in the early evening. Bedtimes of at least 1 hour earlier were also associated with significantly higher RHRs throughout sleep; however, they converged with one’s normal rate by the end of the sleep session, not extending into the following day. These observations stress the importance of maintaining proper sleep habits, beyond sleep duration, as high variability in bedtimes may be detrimental to one’s cardiovascular health. © 2020, The Author(s).","Health; Sleep research; Students; College students; Health outcomes; Resting heart rate; Single components; adolescent; Article; bed rest; cardiovascular system; cohort analysis; college student; female; human; human experiment; male; observational study; physical activity; priority journal; resting heart rate; sleep hygiene; sleep pattern; sleep quality; sleep time; stress; time; Heart","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085303594"

A flexible and wearable wristband, based on microelectromechanical sensor (MEMS) elements array was developed to support this need. The performance of the device in cardiovascular monitoring was investigated by (i) comparing the arterial pressure waveform recordings to the gold standard, invasive catheter recording (n = 18), (ii) analyzing the ability to detect irregularities of the rhythm (n = 7), and (iii) measuring the heartrate monitoring accuracy (n = 31). Arterial waveforms carry important physiological information and the comparison study revealed that the recordings made with the wearable device and with the gold standard device resulted in almost identical (r = 0.9–0.99) pulse waveforms. The device can measure the heart rhythm and possible irregularities in it. A clustering analysis demonstrates a perfect classification accuracy between atrial fibrillation (AF) and sinus rhythm. The heartrate monitoring study showed near perfect beat-to-beat accuracy (sensitivity = 99.1%, precision = 100%) on healthy subjects. In contrast, beat-to-beat detection from coronary artery disease patients was challenging, but the averaged heartrate was extracted successfully (95% CI: −1.2 to 1.1 bpm). In conclusion, the results indicate that the device could be useful in remote monitoring of cardiovascular diseases and personalized medicine. © 2019, The Author(s).","Cardiology; Heart; Patient monitoring; Wearable sensors; Arterial pulse waveforms; Atrial fibrillation; Clinical assessments; Gold standards; Heart Detection; Heart-rate; Heart-rate monitoring; Microelectromechanical sensors; Pressure sensor arrays; Wearable devices; adult; arterial pressure; Article; atrial fibrillation; clinical assessment; coronary artery disease; diagnostic accuracy; female; heart rate; heart rhythm; human; intermethod comparison; male; normal human; priority journal; pulse rate; pulse wave; remote sensing; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; sinus rhythm; Diseases","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135600147"

The recommended first line treatment for non-specific LBP is non-invasive care. A digital care program (DCP) delivering evidence-based non-invasive treatment for LBP can aid self-management by engaging patients and scales personalized therapy for patient-specific needs. We assessed the efficacy of a 12-week DCP for LBP in a two-armed, pre-registered, randomized, controlled trial (RCT). Participants were included based on self-reported duration of LBP, but those with surgery or injury to the lower back in the previous three months were excluded. The treatment group (DCP) received the 12-week DCP, consisting of sensor-guided exercise therapy, education, cognitive behavioral therapy, team and individual behavioral coaching, activity tracking, and symptom tracking – all administered remotely via an app. The control group received three digital education articles only. All participants maintained access to treatment-as-usual. At 12 weeks, an intention-to-treat analysis showed each primary outcome—Oswestry Disability Index (p < 0.001), Korff Pain (p < 0.001) and Korff Disability (p < 0.001)—as well as each secondary outcome improved more for participants in the DCP group compared to control group. For participants who completed the DCP (per protocol), average improvement in pain outcomes ranged 52-64% (Korff: 48.8–23.4, VAS: 43.6–16.5, VAS impact on daily life: 37.3–13.4; p < 0.01 for all) and average improvement in disability outcomes ranged 31–55% (Korff: 33.1–15, ODI: 19.7–13.5; p < 0.01 for both). Surgical interest significantly reduced in the DCP group. Participants that completed the DCP had an average engagement, each week, of 90%. Future studies will further explore the effectiveness of the DCP for long-term outcomes beyond 12 weeks and for a LBP patient population with possibly greater baseline pain and disability. In conclusion, the DCP resulted in improved LBP outcomes compared to treatment-as-usual and has potential to scale personalized evidence-based non-invasive treatment for LBP patients. © 2019, The Author(s).","Noninvasive medical procedures; Control groups; Evidence-based; Low back; Lower back pain; Non-invasive treatment; Patient specific; Personalized therapies; Randomized controlled trial; Self management; Treatment group; adult; Article; clinical outcome; cognitive behavioral therapy; comparative study; controlled study; daily life activity; digital care program; disability; evidence based medicine; female; follow up; health education; human; intention to treat analysis; kinesiotherapy; long term care; low back pain; major clinical study; male; mobile application; non invasive procedure; Oswestry Disability Index; personalized medicine; physical activity; physiotherapy; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; rehabilitation care; self care; self report; sensor guided exercise therapy; symptom assessment; teletherapy; therapy effect; treatment duration; visual analog scale; Surgery","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135599146"

We carried out a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and the proportion of time that heart rate and respiratory rate can be estimated from preterm infants using only a video camera in a clinical environment, without interfering with regular patient care. A total of 426.6 h of video and reference vital signs were recorded for 90 sessions from 30 preterm infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Each preterm infant was recorded under regular ambient light during daytime for up to four consecutive days. We developed multi-task deep learning algorithms to automatically segment skin areas and to estimate vital signs only when the infant was present in the field of view of the video camera and no clinical interventions were undertaken. We propose signal quality assessment algorithms for both heart rate and respiratory rate to discriminate between clinically acceptable and noisy signals. The mean absolute error between the reference and camera-derived heart rates was 2.3 beats/min for over 76% of the time for which the reference and camera data were valid. The mean absolute error between the reference and camera-derived respiratory rate was 3.5 breaths/min for over 82% of the time. Accurate estimates of heart rate and respiratory rate could be derived for at least 90% of the time, if gaps of up to 30 seconds with no estimates were allowed. © 2019, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Heart; Intensive care units; Patient monitoring; Contact technologies; Heart-rate; Mean absolute error; Neonatal intensive care units; Non-contact; Physiological monitoring; Preterm infants; Respiratory rate; Video frame; Vital sign; algorithm; Article; breathing rate; clinical article; deep learning; female; heart rate; human; male; measurement accuracy; measurement error; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn; patient care; patient monitoring; physiological process; prematurity; priority journal; quality control; vital sign; Video cameras","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135598175"

Natural language processing (NLP) may provide a useful method to assess cognitive status in this population. We identified 81 liver transplant recipients with ESLD (4/2013–2/2018) who sent at least one patient-to-provider electronic message pre-transplant and post-transplant, and matched them 1:1 to “healthy” controls—who had similar disease, but had not been evaluated for liver transplant—by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and liver disease. Messages written by patients pre-transplant and post-transplant and controls was compared across 19 NLP measures using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. While there was no difference overall in word length, patients with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease Score (MELD) ≥ 30 (n = 31) had decreased word length in pre-transplant messages (3.95 [interquartile range (IQR) 3.79, 4.14]) compared to post-transplant (4.13 [3.96, 4.28], p = 0.01) and controls (4.2 [4.0, 4.4], p = 0.01); there was no difference between post-transplant and controls (p = 0.4). Patients with MELD ≥ 30 had fewer 6+ letter words in pre-transplant messages (19.5% [16.4, 25.9] compared to post-transplant (23.4% [20.0, 26.7] p = 0.02) and controls (25.0% [19.2, 29.4]; p = 0.01). Overall, patients had increased sentence length pre-transplant (12.0 [9.8, 13.7]) compared to post-transplant (11.0 [9.2, 13.3]; p = 0.046); the same was seen for MELD ≥ 30 (12.3 [9.8, 13.7] pre-transplant vs. 10.8 [9.6, 13.0] post-transplant; p = 0.050). Application of NLP to patient-generated messages identified language differences—longer sentences with shorter words—that resolved after transplant.

Previously, menstruation was primarily studied through survey results; however, as menstrual tracking mobile apps become more widely adopted, they provide an increasingly large, content-rich source of menstrual health experiences and behaviors over time. By exploring a database of user-tracked observations from the Clue app by BioWink GmbH of over 378,000 users and 4.9 million natural cycles, we show that self-reported menstrual tracker data can reveal statistically significant relationships between per-person cycle length variability and self-reported qualitative symptoms. A concern for self-tracked data is that they reflect not only physiological behaviors, but also the engagement dynamics of app users. To mitigate such potential artifacts, we develop a procedure to exclude cycles lacking user engagement, thereby allowing us to better distinguish true menstrual patterns from tracking anomalies. We uncover that women located at different ends of the menstrual variability spectrum, based on the consistency of their cycle length statistics, exhibit statistically significant differences in their cycle characteristics and symptom tracking patterns. We also find that cycle and period length statistics are stationary over the app usage timeline across the variability spectrum. The symptoms that we identify as showing statistically significant association with timing data can be useful to clinicians and users for predicting cycle variability from symptoms, or as potential health indicators for conditions like endometriosis. Our findings showcase the potential of longitudinal, high-resolution self-tracked data to improve understanding of menstruation and women’s health as a whole. © 2020, The Author(s).","mHealth; Physiology; Cycle characteristic; Cycle length; Health data; Key indicator; Menstrual cycle; Mobile app; Natural cycle; Spectra's; Statistically significant difference; User engagement; adult; Article; cohort analysis; emotion; endometriosis; energy; exercise; female; food craving; human; major clinical study; menstrual cycle; menstruation; mental health; mobile application; motivation; physiological process; premenstrual syndrome; priority journal; self evaluation; sexual health; social behavior; women's health; Surveys","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087529600"

Ultrasound imaging is portable and universally safe, but existing modalities cannot image usefully inside the adult human skull. We use in silico simulations to demonstrate that full-waveform inversion, a computational technique originally developed in geophysics, is able to generate accurate three-dimensional images of the brain with sub-millimetre resolution. This approach overcomes the familiar problems of conventional ultrasound neuroimaging by using the following: transcranial ultrasound that is not obscured by strong reflections from the skull, low frequencies that are readily transmitted with good signal-to-noise ratio, an accurate wave equation that properly accounts for the physics of wave propagation, and adaptive waveform inversion that is able to create an accurate model of the skull that then compensates properly for wavefront distortion. Laboratory ultrasound data, using ex vivo human skulls and in vivo transcranial signals, demonstrate that our computational experiments mimic the penetration and signal-to-noise ratios expected in clinical applications. This form of non-invasive neuroimaging has the potential for the rapid diagnosis of stroke and head trauma, and for the provision of routine monitoring of a wide range of neurological conditions. © 2020, The Author(s).","Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neuroimaging; Ultrasonic imaging; Wave propagation; Waveform analysis; Computational technique; Full-waveform inversion; High spatial resolution; Human brain; Human skull; In-silico; Silico simulation; Three dimensional images; Ultrasound imaging; X-ray computed tomography; Article; cerebrovascular accident; computer simulation; ex vivo study; head injury; human; in vivo study; measurement accuracy; neuroimaging; non invasive measurement; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; signal noise ratio; simulation; skull; three-dimensional imaging; ultrasound; waveform; x-ray computed tomography; Signal to noise ratio","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086999790"

It is the leading risk factor for cardioembolic stroke and its early detection is crucial in both primary and secondary stroke prevention. Continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm is today possible thanks to consumer-grade wearable devices, enabling transformative diagnostic and patient management tools. Such monitoring is possible using low-cost easy-to-implement optical sensors that today equip the majority of wearables. These sensors record blood volume variations—a technology known as photoplethysmography (PPG)—from which the heart rate and other physiological parameters can be extracted to inform about user activity, fitness, sleep, and health. Recently, new wearable devices were introduced as being capable of AF detection, evidenced by large prospective trials in some cases. Such devices would allow for early screening of AF and initiation of therapy to prevent stroke. This review is a summary of a body of work on AF detection using PPG. A thorough account of the signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning approaches used in these studies is presented, followed by a discussion of their limitations and challenges towards clinical applications. © 2020, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Diseases; Physiological models; Signal processing; Wearable sensors; Atrial fibrillation; Cardiac rhythms; Continuous monitoring; Diagnostics management; Low-costs; Management tool; Patient management; Rhythm disorders; Risk factors; Wearable devices; arterial oxygen saturation; arterial oxygen tension; atrial fibrillation; augmentation index; blood volume; deep learning; detection algorithm; heart arrhythmia; human; information processing; machine learning; photoelectric plethysmography; priority journal; pulse wave; Review; signal processing; statistical analysis; Photoplethysmography","Nature Research","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084059475"

We investigated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of iCBT when fully integrated within IAPT stepped-care settings. We conducted an 8-week pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a 2:1 (iCBT intervention: waiting-list) allocation, for participants referred to an IAPT Step 2 service with depression and anxiety symptoms (Trial registration: ISRCTN91967124). The primary outcomes measures were PHQ-9 (depressive symptoms) and GAD-7 (anxiety symptoms) and WSAS (functional impairment) as a secondary outcome. The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on EQ-5D-5L (preference-based health status) to elicit the quality-adjust life year (QALY) and a modified-Client Service Receipt Inventory (care resource-use). Diagnostic interviews were administered at baseline and 3 months. Three-hundred and sixty-one participants were randomized (iCBT, 241; waiting-list, 120). Intention-to-treat analyses showed significant interaction effects for the PHQ-9 (b = −2.75, 95% CI −4.00, −1.50) and GAD-7 (b = −2.79, 95% CI −4.00, −1.58) in favour of iCBT at 8-week and further improvements observed up to 12-months. Over 8-weeks the probability of cost-effectiveness was 46.6% if decision makers are willing to pay £30,000 per QALY, increasing to 91.2% when the control-arm’s outcomes and costs were extrapolated over 12-months. Results indicate that iCBT for depression and anxiety is effective and potentially cost-effective in the long-term within IAPT. Upscaling the use of iCBT as part of stepped care could help to enhance IAPT outcomes.

We present a large-scale longitudinal study (18 months) of the DDI phenomenon at the primary- and secondary-care level using electronic health records (EHR) from the city of Blumenau in Southern Brazil (pop. ≈340,000). We found that 181 distinct drug pairs known to interact were dispensed concomitantly to 12% of the patients in the city’s public health-care system. Further, 4% of the patients were dispensed drug pairs that are likely to result in major adverse drug reactions (ADR)—with costs estimated to be much larger than previously reported in smaller studies. The large-scale analysis reveals that women have a 60% increased risk of DDI as compared to men; the increase becomes 90% when considering only DDI known to lead to major ADR. Furthermore, DDI risk increases substantially with age; patients aged 70–79 years have a 34% risk of DDI when they are dispensed two or more drugs concomitantly. Interestingly, a statistical null model demonstrates that age- and female-specific risks from increased polypharmacy fail by far to explain the observed DDI risks in those populations, suggesting unknown social or biological causes. We also provide a network visualization of drugs and demographic factors that characterize the DDI phenomenon and demonstrate that accurate DDI prediction can be included in health care and public-health management, to reduce DDI-related ADR and costs. © 2019, The Author(s).","Drug interactions; Health care; Population statistics; Records management; Risk assessment; acetylsalicylic acid; amiodarone; amitriptyline; atenolol; biperiden; carbamazepine; clonazepam; diazepam; diclofenac; digoxin; diltiazem; ethinylestradiol; fluconazole; fluoxetine; furosemide; glibenclamide; gliclazide; haloperidol; ibuprofen; imipramine; levonorgestrel; lithium; nortriptyline; omeprazole; propranolol; salbutamol; simvastatin; spironolactone; warfarin; Adverse drug reactions; Care level; Drug-drug interactions; Electronic health; Health records; Healthcare systems; Interaction phenomena; Large-scales; Longitudinal study; Southern Brazil; adverse drug reaction; aged; Article; Brazil; controlled study; demography; drug potentiation; electronic health record; female; gender bias; health care system; human; longitudinal study; male; observational study; polypharmacy; prediction; primary health care; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; secondary health care; statistical bias; Public health","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094748101"

Germany’s new Digital Healthcare Act (Digitale–Versorgung–Gesetz or DVG) entitles all individuals covered by statutory health insurance to reimbursement for certain digital health applications (i.e., insurers will pay for their use). Since Germany, like the United States (US), is a multi-payer health care system, the new Act provides a particularly interesting case study for US policymakers. We first provide an overview of the new German DVG and outline the landscape for reimbursement of digital health solutions in the US, including recent changes to policies governing telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. We then discuss challenges and unanswered questions raised by the DVG, ranging from the limited scope of the Act to privacy issues.

We aimed primarily to determine the accuracy of patient generated differentials for new symptoms with and without online searching, and secondarily, to evaluate the impact of searching on anxiety levels. In the waiting room prior to seeing a clinician, 300 patients with new symptoms were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to Google searching with health related features including a symptom search tool vs Google searching with health related features disabled vs no searching. Participants were 18 years or older and presenting to the emergency department of an urban academic medical center with new low-acuity symptoms that were not due to exacerbation of a chronic condition. Search groups received access on a tablet/smartphone to Google searching with or without health related features. Both search groups could access any websites; health related features led the patient to common diagnoses and physician-validated information. The primary outcome was accuracy of the patient generated differential assessed by matching at least two of the top three diagnoses on the clinician’s differential. A secondary outcome was anxiety by a visual analogue scale. Patients were a median of 33.1 (IQI 26.2–45.9) years old, 60% women, 63% black, 82% had a high school education or less, and 45.7% reported having performed an online search prior to presentation. Search group patients spent a median of 3.82 (2.53–5.72) minutes searching online. Similar proportions of patients in each group matched at least two of three clinician diagnoses: 27.0% and 28.3% for Google searching with and without health related features vs 23.8% in the no search group. Patients in the search groups had a similar odds of matching ≥2/3 diagnoses as the no search group [OR (95% CI): 1.23 (0.70–2.13), p = 0.47]. Anxiety was unchanged with online searching. In conclusion, brief online searching in the waiting room did not improve accuracy of patient generated differential diagnoses for new symptoms. The absence of an increase in patient anxiety provides reassurance for subsequent work to refine and investigate online symptom search tools. © 2019, The Author(s).","Hospitals; Search engines; Academic medical centers; Anxiety levels; Differential diagnosis; Emergency departments; Google+; Matchings; No search; Randomized controlled trial; Search tools; Waiting room; adult; anxiety; Article; differential diagnosis; doctor patient relationship; female; human; internet access; major clinical study; male; online system; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); symptom; visual analog scale; Diagnosis","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103496110"

We compared UK members at baseline (years 1 and 2) prior to Vitality’s Active Rewards (VAR) intervention commencing (year 3) and follow-up (year 4) for verified, self-reported (encompassing additional physical activities), mortality relative risk and satisfaction with physical activity. Members were categorised into low-active, medium-active and high-active by tertiles of baseline physical activity. Of 11,881 participants, 6477(54.5%) were male, with mean age 39.7(SD 9.8) years. At follow-up, annual active days had increased by 56% overall [60.8(59.7–61.9)–94.8(93.0–96.5)]; 554% in low-active [8.5(8.3–8.7)–47.1(44.7–49.5)]; 205% in medium-active [39.8(39.4–40.2)–81.4(78.7–84.1)] and 17% in high-active members [131.7(129.9–133.5)–153.7(150.7–156.7)] (all p < 0.001). Annual weeks of attaining international physical activity recommendations increased by 19% overall [22.2(42.8%)–26.4(50.8%)] and by 316% for low-active members [4.9(9.5%)–15.5(29.8%)]. Self-reported active minutes/week increased by 45% overall [1423(139.4–145.2)–207.0(201.8–212.3)] and 712% in low-active members [20.1(19.3–21.0)–143.2(134.6–151.9)]. Happiness with exercise levels also increased from 1985(49.4%) to 3414(84.9%) members (all p < 0.001). The relative risk of mortality from a lack of physical activity reduced by 7% for low-active members [from 0.99 to 0.92], 5% for medium-active [0.94–0.89] and 3% for high-active [0.89–0.86](p < 0.001) and by 0.02% for each additional year of age (p = 0.02). This large-scale, real-world, short-term-incentives intervention led to a dramatic increase in physical activity which was sustained for, and still increasing after, two years.

This slows down medical progress, as technologies that rely on these data – artificial intelligence, big data or mobile applications – cannot be used to their full potential. In this article, we argue that interoperability is a prerequisite for the digital innovations envisioned for future medicine. We focus on four areas where interoperable data and IT systems are particularly important: (1) artificial intelligence and big data; (2) medical communication; (3) research; and (4) international cooperation.

Behavioral assessments, such as Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) for monitoring levels of sedation and Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) for detecting signs of delirium, are often used. As an alternative, brain monitoring with electroencephalography (EEG) has been proposed in the operating room, but is challenging to implement in ICU due to the differences between critical illness and elective surgery, as well as the duration of sedation. Here we present a deep learning model based on a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks that automatically tracks both the level of consciousness and delirium using frontal EEG signals in the ICU. For level of consciousness, the system achieves a median accuracy of 70% when allowing prediction to be within one RASS level difference across all patients, which is comparable or higher than the median technician–nurse agreement at 59%. For delirium, the system achieves an AUC of 0.80 with 69% sensitivity and 83% specificity at the optimal operating point. The results show it is feasible to continuously track level of consciousness and delirium in the ICU. © 2019, The Author(s).","Diseases; Electrophysiology; Recurrent neural networks; propofol; Automated tracking; Behavioral assessment; Brain monitoring; Elective surgeries; Learning models; Level difference; Level of consciousness; Model-based OPC; Optimal operating point; Scale levels; adult; aged; APACHE; Article; artificial ventilation; body mass; brain function; clinical research; consciousness level; convolutional neural network; critical illness; deep learning; delirium; elective surgery; electroencephalography; eye movement; female; human; intensive care unit; long short term memory network; major clinical study; male; neuromonitoring; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; recurrent neural network; Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale; sedation; sensitivity and specificity; Electroencephalography","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134782618"

Although current guidelines advise to consider clinical symptoms and exercise tolerance during decision-making in heart disease, it remains unknown to which extent wearables can help to determine such functional capacity measures. In clinical settings, the 6-minute walk test has become a standardized diagnostic and prognostic marker. We aimed to explore, whether 6-minute walk distances can be predicted by wrist-worn devices in patients with different stages of mitral and aortic valve disease. A total of n = 107 sensor datasets with 1,019,748 min of recordings were analysed. Based on heart rate recordings and literature information, activity levels were determined and compared to results from a 6-minute walk test. The percentage of time spent in moderate activity was a predictor for the achievement of gender, age and body mass index-specific 6-minute walk distances (p < 0.001; R2 = 0.48). The uncertainty of these predictions is demonstrated. © 2020, The Author(s).","Cardiology; Decision making; Diagnosis; Diseases; Heart; Patient monitoring; 'current; Capacity measures; Clinical symptoms; Decisions makings; Functional capacity; Heart disease; Heart-rate monitoring; Walk distances; Walk tests; Wearable devices; adult; age; aged; aortic valve disease; Article; body mass; cardiopulmonary exercise test; female; gender; heart disease; heart rate; human; major clinical study; male; mitral valve disease; outcome assessment; prediction; priority journal; six minute walk test; walking distance; Wearable technology","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087888033"

Their success has created considerable interest for its use in healthcare applications; one area of prolific growth in AI is that of voice-based virtual counselors for mental health and well-being. However, in spite of its promise, building realistic virtual counselors to achieve higher-order maturity levels beyond task-based interactions presents considerable conceptual and pragmatic challenges. We describe one such conceptual challenge—cognitive plausibility, defined as the ability of virtual counselors to emulate the human cognitive system by simulating how a skill or function is accomplished. An important cognitive plausibility consideration for voice-based agents is its ability to engage in meaningful and seamless interactive communication. Drawing on a broad interdisciplinary research literature and based on our experiences with developing two voice-based (voice-only) prototypes that are in the early phases of testing, we articulate two conceptual considerations for their design and use—conceptualizing voice-based virtual counselors as communicative agents and establishing virtual co-presence. We discuss why these conceptual considerations are important and how it can lead to the development of voice-based counselors for real-world use. © 2020, The Author(s).","Virtual reality; Health care application; High-order; Higher-order; Home-based; Human cognitive systems; Maturity levels; Mental health; Personal assistants; Task-based; Well being; counselor; drawing; human; human experiment; interdisciplinary research; note; skill; voice; Cognitive systems","Nature Research","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088065392"

Artificial Intelligence-Clinical Decision Support System (AI-CDSS) has the potential to assist physicians in heart failure diagnosis. The aim of this work was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an AI-CDSS for heart failure. AI-CDSS for cardiology was developed with a hybrid (expert-driven and machine-learning-driven) approach of knowledge acquisition to evolve the knowledge base with heart failure diagnosis. A retrospective cohort of 1198 patients with and without heart failure was used for the development of AI-CDSS (training dataset, n = 600) and to test the performance (test dataset, n = 598). A prospective clinical pilot study of 97 patients with dyspnea was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of AI-CDSS compared with that of non-heart failure specialists. The concordance rate between AI-CDSS and heart failure specialists was evaluated. In retrospective cohort, the concordance rate was 98.3% in the test dataset. The concordance rate for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and no heart failure was 100%, 100%, 99.6%, and 91.7%, respectively. In a prospective pilot study of 97 patients presenting with dyspnea to the outpatient clinic, 44% had heart failure. The concordance rate between AI-CDSS and heart failure specialists was 98%, whereas that between non-heart failure specialists and heart failure specialists was 76%. In conclusion, AI-CDSS showed a high diagnostic accuracy for heart failure. Therefore, AI-CDSS may be useful for the diagnosis of heart failure, especially when heart failure specialists are not available. © 2020, The Author(s).","Artificial heart; Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Heart; Knowledge based systems; Statistical tests; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; Clinical decision support systems; Diagnostic accuracy; Ejection fraction; Failure Diagnosis; Heart failure; Machine-learning; Prospectives; System failures; Systems trainings; Training dataset; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; cardiology; cardiovascular performance; clinical assessment; clinical decision support system; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; dyspnea; female; heart ejection fraction; heart failure; heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; human; knowledge base; learning; machine learning; major clinical study; male; medical specialist; middle aged; outpatient department; pilot study; priority journal; prospective study; retrospective study; Cardiology","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085469385"

CDSS are used to augment clinicians in their complex decision-making processes. Since their first use in the 1980s, CDSS have seen a rapid evolution. They are now commonly administered through electronic medical records and other computerized clinical workflows, which has been facilitated by increasing global adoption of electronic medical records with advanced capabilities. Despite these advances, there remain unknowns regarding the effect CDSS have on the providers who use them, patient outcomes, and costs. There have been numerous published examples in the past decade(s) of CDSS success stories, but notable setbacks have also shown us that CDSS are not without risks. In this paper, we provide a state-of-the-art overview on the use of clinical decision support systems in medicine, including the different types, current use cases with proven efficacy, common pitfalls, and potential harms.

Automated, fast, and reliable detection of diseases based on chest radiography is a critical step in radiology workflow. In this work, we developed and evaluated various deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for differentiating between normal and abnormal frontal chest radiographs, in order to help alert radiologists and clinicians of potential abnormal findings as a means of work list triaging and reporting prioritization. A CNN-based model achieved an AUC of 0.9824 ± 0.0043 (with an accuracy of 94.64 ± 0.45%, a sensitivity of 96.50 ± 0.36% and a specificity of 92.86 ± 0.48%) for normal versus abnormal chest radiograph classification. The CNN model obtained an AUC of 0.9804 ± 0.0032 (with an accuracy of 94.71 ± 0.32%, a sensitivity of 92.20 ± 0.34% and a specificity of 96.34 ± 0.31%) for normal versus lung opacity classification. Classification performance on the external dataset showed that the CNN model is likely to be highly generalizable, with an AUC of 0.9444 ± 0.0029. The CNN model pre-trained on cohorts of adult patients and fine-tuned on pediatric patients achieved an AUC of 0.9851 ± 0.0046 for normal versus pneumonia classification. Pretraining with natural images demonstrates benefit for a moderate-sized training image set of about 8500 images. The remarkable performance in diagnostic accuracy observed in this study shows that deep CNNs can accurately and effectively differentiate normal and abnormal chest radiographs, thereby providing potential benefits to radiology workflow and patient care. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Computer aided diagnosis; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Medical imaging; Neural network models; Radiation; Radiography; Radiology; Automated detection; Chest radiographs; Chest radiography; Convolutional neural network; Diagnoses of disease; Diagnostic imaging; Imaging tests; Medical practice; Neural network model; Radiology workflow; abnormal laboratory result; adult; Article; automation; classification algorithm; clinical trial; clinician; cohort analysis; convolutional neural network; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; evaluation study; human; image analysis; pneumonia; priority journal; radiologist; sensitivity and specificity; thorax radiography; Classification (of information)","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087714474"

A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, embase and computers and applied sciences complete databases. Relevant papers included “machine learning” or “artificial intelligence” and the autoimmune diseases search term(s) in their title, abstract or key words. Exclusion criteria: studies not written in English, no real human patient data included, publication prior to 2001, studies that were not peer reviewed, non-autoimmune disease comorbidity research and review papers. 169 (of 702) studies met the criteria for inclusion. Support vector machines and random forests were the most popular ML methods used. ML models using data on multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease were most common. A small proportion of studies (7.7% or 13/169) combined different data types in the modelling process. Cross-validation, combined with a separate testing set for more robust model evaluation occurred in 8.3% of papers (14/169). The field may benefit from adopting a best practice of validation, cross-validation and independent testing of ML models. Many models achieved good predictive results in simple scenarios (e.g. classification of cases and controls).

Algorithms that process these data and inform digital diagnostics are typically developed using training and test sets generated from multiple repeated measures collected across a set of individuals. However, the inclusion of repeated measurements is not always appropriately taken into account in the analytical evaluations of predictive performance. The assignment of repeated measurements from each individual to both the training and the test sets (“record-wise” data split) is a common practice and can lead to massive underestimation of the prediction error due to the presence of “identity confounding.” In essence, these models learn to identify subjects, in addition to diagnostic signal. Here, we present a method that can be used to effectively calculate the amount of identity confounding learned by classifiers developed using a record-wise data split. By applying this method to several real datasets, we demonstrate that identity confounding is a serious issue in digital health studies and that record-wise data splits for machine learning- based applications need to be avoided. © 2019, The Author(s).","Clinical research; Clinical application; Diagnostic applications; Health data; High-dimensional; Higher-dimensional; Machine-learning; On-machines; Repeated measurements; Research applications; Test sets; adult; article; classifier; prediction; Machine learning","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135600184"

Rapid diagnosis and initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the cornerstone of therapy for victims of cardiac arrest. Yet a significant fraction of cardiac arrest victims have no chance of survival because they experience an unwitnessed event, often in the privacy of their own homes. An under-appreciated diagnostic element of cardiac arrest is the presence of agonal breathing, an audible biomarker and brainstem reflex that arises in the setting of severe hypoxia. Here, we demonstrate that a support vector machine (SVM) can classify agonal breathing instances in real-time within a bedroom environment. Using real-world labeled 9-1-1 audio of cardiac arrests, we train the SVM to accurately classify agonal breathing instances. We obtain an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9993 ± 0.0003 and an operating point with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 97.24% (95% CI: 96.86–97.61%) and 99.51% (95% CI: 99.35–99.67%). We achieve a false positive rate between 0 and 0.14% over 82 h (117,985 audio segments) of polysomnographic sleep lab data that includes snoring, hypopnea, central, and obstructive sleep apnea events. We also evaluate our classifier in home sleep environments: the false positive rate was 0–0.22% over 164 h (236,666 audio segments) of sleep data collected across 35 different bedroom environments.

While these evaluations provide critical information on an individual’s reproductive health status, they typically rely on memory-based self-reports, and the results are rarely, if ever, assessed at the population level. In recent years, mobile apps for menstrual tracking have become very popular, allowing us to evaluate the reliability and tracking frequency of millions of self-observations, thereby providing an unparalleled view, both in detail and scale, on menstrual health and its evolution for large populations. In particular, the primary aim of this study was to describe the tracking behavior of the app users and their overall observation patterns in an effort to understand if they were consistent with previous small-scale medical studies. The secondary aim was to investigate whether their precision allowed the detection and estimation of ovulation timing, which is critical for reproductive and menstrual health. Retrospective self-observation data were acquired from two mobile apps dedicated to the application of the sympto-thermal fertility awareness method, resulting in a dataset of more than 30 million days of observations from over 2.7 million cycles for two hundred thousand users. The analysis of the data showed that up to 40% of the cycles in which users were seeking pregnancy had recordings every single day. With a modeling approach using Hidden Markov Models to describe the collected data and estimate ovulation timing, it was found that follicular phases average duration and range were larger than previously reported, with only 24% of ovulations occurring at cycle days 14 to 15, while the luteal phase duration and range were in line with previous reports, although short luteal phases (10 days or less) were more frequently observed (in up to 20% of cycles). The digital epidemiology approach presented here can help to lead to a better understanding of menstrual health and its connection to women’s health overall, which has historically been severely understudied. © 2019, The Author(s).","Health; Detection and estimation; Health status; Large population; Medical studies; Mobile app; Population levels; Reproductive health; Self-observation; Small scale; Tracking behavior; adult; article; awareness; female; fertility; follicular phase; health status; hidden Markov model; human; luteal phase; mobile application; ovulation; pregnancy; self evaluation; women's health; Hidden Markov models","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135598672"

The EuleriAn Video Magnification ApPLications In Heart Failure StudY (AMPLIFY) pilot aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a novel noninvasive method that uses Eulerian video magnification. Video recordings were performed on the neck veins of 50 patients who were scheduled for right heart catheterization at the Palo Alto VA Medical Center. The recorded jugular venous pulsations were then enhanced by applying Eulerian phase-based motion magnification. Assessment of jugular venous pressure was compared across three categories: (1) physicians who performed bedside exams, (2) physicians who reviewed both the amplified and unamplified videos, and (3) direct invasive measurement of right atrial pressure from right heart catheterization. Motion magnification reduced inaccuracy of the clinician assessment of central venous pressure compared to the gold standard of right heart catheterization (mean discrepancy of −0.80 cm H2O; 95% CI −2.189 to 0.612, p = 0.27) when compared to both unamplified video (−1.84 cm H2O; 95% CI −3.22 to −0.46, p = 0.0096) and the bedside exam (−2.90 cm H2O; 95% CI −4.33 to 1.40, p = 0.0002). Major categorical disagreements with right heart catheterization were significantly reduced with motion magnification (12%) when compared to unamplified video (25%) or the bedside exam (27%). This novel method of assessing jugular venous pressure improves the accuracy of the clinical exam and may enable accurate remote monitoring of heart failure patients with minimal patient risk. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Blood pressure; Cardiology; Diagnosis; Heart; Noninvasive medical procedures; Remote control; Risk assessment; 'current; Eulerian; Heart catheterization; Heart failure; Medical center; Monitoring device; Noninvasive methods; Phase based; Remote monitoring; Venous pressure; adult; aged; Article; body mass; cardiac index; central venous pressure; chest circumference; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; ex-smoker; gold standard; heart catheterization; heart failure; heart output; heart rate; heart right atrium pressure; human; image processing; non invasive procedure; obesity; pilot study; priority journal; pulmonary artery; pulmonary artery occlusion pressure; remote sensing; underweight; videorecording; Video recording","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094558605"

We evaluate Lymelight using the official case count data from CDC and find a 92% correlation (p < 0.001) at county level. Importantly, using web search data allows us not only to assess the incidence of the disease, but also to examine the appropriateness of treatments subsequently searched for by the users. Public health implications of our work include monitoring the spread of vector-borne diseases in a timely and scalable manner, complementing existing approaches through real-time detection, which can enable more timely interventions. Our analysis of treatment searches may also help reduce misdiagnosis of the disease. © 2020, The Author(s).","Diseases; Websites; amoxicillin; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; cefalexin; ceftriaxone; cefuroxime; ciprofloxacin; clarithromycin; clindamycin; cotrimoxazole; doxycycline; essential oil; fluconazole; hash oil; hydroxychloroquine; ivermectin; metronidazole; penicillin derivative; permethrin; prednisone; rifampicin; tinidazole; unclassified drug; Count datum; Disease risks; Disease spread; Disease symptoms; Geographical area; Lyme disease; Northern Hemispheres; Real- time; Search sessions; Web searches; antibiotic therapy; Article; classifier; climate change; controlled study; epidemiological monitoring; female; forecasting; geographic distribution; human; incidence; infection risk; Lyme disease; Lymelight; machine learning; major clinical study; multicenter study; priority journal; public health; tick borne disease; treatment indication; web browser; World Health Organization; Information retrieval","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082709082"

Many of these technologies exploit historical patient health data to build powerful predictive models that can be used to improve diagnosis and understanding of disease. However, there are many issues concerning patient privacy that need to be accounted for in order to enable this data to be better harnessed by all sectors. One approach that could offer a method of circumventing privacy issues is the creation of realistic synthetic data sets that capture as many of the complexities of the original data set (distributions, non-linear relationships, and noise) but that does not actually include any real patient data. While previous research has explored models for generating synthetic data sets, here we explore the integration of resampling, probabilistic graphical modelling, latent variable identification, and outlier analysis for producing realistic synthetic data based on UK primary care patient data. In particular, we focus on handling missingness, complex interactions between variables, and the resulting sensitivity analysis statistics from machine learning classifiers, while quantifying the risks of patient re-identification from synthetic datapoints. We show that, through our approach of integrating outlier analysis with graphical modelling and resampling, we can achieve synthetic data sets that are not significantly different from original ground truth data in terms of feature distributions, feature dependencies, and sensitivity analysis statistics when inferring machine learning classifiers. What is more, the risk of generating synthetic data that is identical or very similar to real patients is shown to be low. © The Author(s) 2020.","Classification (of information); Data integration; Diagnosis; Graphic methods; Health care; Hospital data processing; Machine learning; Risk assessment; Statistics; Artificial intelligence technologies; Growing demand; High-fidelity; Learning classifiers; Machine-learning; Outlier analysis; Patient data; Resampling; Synthetic data; Synthetic datasets; Sensitivity analysis","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099203821"

Recent advances in the development of mobile digitally connected technologies have led to the emergence of a new class of biomarkers measured across multiple layers of hardware and software. Quantified in ones and zeros, these “digital” biomarkers can support continuous measurements outside the physical confines of the clinical environment. The modular software–hardware combination of these products has created new opportunities for patient care and biomedical research, enabling remote monitoring and decentralized clinical trial designs. However, a systematic approach to assessing the quality and utility of digital biomarkers to ensure an appropriate balance between their safety and effectiveness is needed.

Several remotely conducted studies have recruited thousands of participants over a span of a few months allowing researchers to collect real-world data at scale and at a fraction of the cost of traditional research. Unfortunately, remote studies have been hampered by substantial participant attrition, calling into question the representativeness of the collected data including generalizability of outcomes. We report the findings regarding recruitment and retention from eight remote digital health studies conducted between 2014–2019 that provided individual-level study-app usage data from more than 100,000 participants completing nearly 3.5 million remote health evaluations over cumulative participation of 850,000 days. Median participant retention across eight studies varied widely from 2–26 days (median across all studies = 5.5 days). Survival analysis revealed several factors significantly associated with increase in participant retention time, including (i) referral by a clinician to the study (increase of 40 days in median retention time); (ii) compensation for participation (increase of 22 days, 1 study); (iii) having the clinical condition of interest in the study (increase of 7 days compared with controls); and (iv) older age (increase of 4 days). Additionally, four distinct patterns of daily app usage behavior were identified by unsupervised clustering, which were also associated with participant demographics. Most studies were not able to recruit a sample that was representative of the race/ethnicity or geographical diversity of the US. Together these findings can help inform recruitment and retention strategies to enable equitable participation of populations in future digital health research. © 2020, The Author(s).","Biomedical research; Digital technologies; Health evaluation; Health-study; Individual levels; Real-world; Retention time; Smart phones; Survival analysis; Usage data; aged; article; compensation; controlled study; demography; ethnicity; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; medical research; patient referral; race; retention time; survival analysis; Clinical research","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085194062"

In addition to providing detailed diagnostic data, these methods have the potential to simulate patient-specific interventions and to predict their outcome. Our objective was to evaluate to which extent patient-specific modelling influences treatment decisions in coarctation of the aorta (CoA), a common congenital heart disease. We selected three cases with CoA, two of which had borderline indications for intervention according to current clinical guidelines. The third case was not indicated for intervention according to guidelines. For each case, we generated two separate datasets. First dataset included conventional diagnostic parameters (echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging). In the second, we added modelled parameters (pressure fields). For the two cases with borderline indications for intervention, the second dataset also included pressure fields after virtual stenting simulations. All parameters were computed by modelling methods that were previously validated. In an online-administered, invitation-only survey, we randomized 178 paediatric cardiologists to view either conventional (control) or add-on modelling (experimental) datasets. Primary endpoint was the proportion of participants recommending different therapeutic options: (1) surgery or catheter lab (collectively, “intervention”) or (2) no intervention (follow-up with or without medication). Availability of data from computational predictive modelling influenced therapeutic decision making in two of three cases. There was a statistically significant association between group assignment and the recommendation of an intervention for one borderline case and one non-borderline case: 94.3% vs. 72.2% (RR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.14–1.50, p = 0.00) and 18.8% vs. 5.1% (RR: 3.09, 95% CI: 1.17–8.18, p = 0.01) of participants in the experimental and control groups respectively recommended an intervention. For the remaining case, there was no difference between the experimental and control group and the majority of participants recommended intervention. In sub-group analyses, findings were not affected by the experience level of participating cardiologists. Despite existing clinical guidelines, the therapy recommendations of the participating physicians were heterogeneous. Validated patient-specific computational modelling has the potential to influence treatment decisions. Future studies in broader areas are needed to evaluate whether differences in decisions result in improved outcomes (Trial Registration: NCT02700737). © 2019, The Author(s).","Cardiology; Computation theory; Decision making; Diseases; Magnetic resonance imaging; Patient treatment; Pediatrics; Clinical application; Clinical guideline; Computational modelling; Congenital heart disease; Control groups; Decisions makings; Experimental groups; Patient specific; Pressure-field; Randomized controlled trial; aortic coarctation; aortic surgery; Article; cardiac imaging; cardiologist; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical decision making; controlled study; echocardiography; female; heart catheterization; human; major clinical study; male; online analysis; pediatric cardiology; personalized medicine; practice guideline; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; Echocardiography","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093973635"

Accuracy of wearable technologies has been a hotly debated topic in both the research and popular science literature. Currently, wearable technology companies are responsible for assessing and reporting the accuracy of their products, but little information about the evaluation method is made publicly available. Heart rate measurements from wearables are derived from photoplethysmography (PPG), an optical method for measuring changes in blood volume under the skin. Potential inaccuracies in PPG stem from three major areas, includes (1) diverse skin types, (2) motion artifacts, and (3) signal crossover. To date, no study has systematically explored the accuracy of wearables across the full range of skin tones. Here, we explored heart rate and PPG data from consumer- and research-grade wearables under multiple circumstances to test whether and to what extent these inaccuracies exist. We saw no statistically significant difference in accuracy across skin tones, but we saw significant differences between devices, and between activity types, notably, that absolute error during activity was, on average, 30% higher than during rest. Our conclusions indicate that different wearables are all reasonably accurate at resting and prolonged elevated heart rate, but that differences exist between devices in responding to changes in activity. This has implications for researchers, clinicians, and consumers in drawing study conclusions, combining study results, and making health-related decisions using these devices. © 2020, The Author(s).","Decision making; Health care; Heart; Wearable sensors; Clinical research; Decisions makings; Evaluation methods; Health-care decisions; Healthcare IT; Heart rate sensors; Heart-rate; Optical-; Skin tone; Technology companies; accelerometry; adult; Article; cost benefit analysis; electrocardiogram; female; heart beat; heart rate; heart rate measurement; human; major clinical study; male; measurement accuracy; measurement error; physical activity; priority journal; resting heart rate; Clinical research","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084337391"

This study aims to validate one such algorithm on a large-scale clinical population, and compare the algorithm performance with that of human graders. A total of 25,326 gradable retinal images of patients with diabetes from the community-based, nationwide screening program of DR in Thailand were analyzed for DR severity and referable diabetic macular edema (DME). Grades adjudicated by a panel of international retinal specialists served as the reference standard. Relative to human graders, for detecting referable DR (moderate NPDR or worse), the deep learning algorithm had significantly higher sensitivity (0.97 vs. 0.74, p < 0.001), and a slightly lower specificity (0.96 vs. 0.98, p < 0.001). Higher sensitivity of the algorithm was also observed for each of the categories of severe or worse NPDR, PDR, and DME (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). The quadratic-weighted kappa for determination of DR severity levels by the algorithm and human graders was 0.85 and 0.78 respectively (p < 0.001 for the difference). Across different severity levels of DR for determining referable disease, deep learning significantly reduced the false negative rate (by 23%) at the cost of slightly higher false positive rates (2%).

The TCGA image database covers 25 anatomic sites and contains 32 cancer subtypes. High-performance storage and GPU power were employed for experimentation. The results were assessed with conservative “majority voting” to build consensus for subtype diagnosis through vertical search and demonstrated high accuracy values for both frozen section slides (e.g., bladder urothelial carcinoma 93%, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma 97%, and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma 99%) and permanent histopathology slides (e.g., prostate adenocarcinoma 98%, skin cutaneous melanoma 99%, and thymoma 100%). The key finding of this validation study was that computational consensus appears to be possible for rendering diagnoses if a sufficiently large number of searchable cases are available for each cancer subtype. © 2020, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Diseases; Image segmentation; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Cancer diagnostics; Cancer genome; Cancer subtypes; Classification methods; Digital pathologies; Image search; Image-analysis; Matchings; Segmentation methods; adrenal cortex carcinoma; Article; artificial intelligence; bile duct carcinoma; breast carcinoma; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; carcinosarcoma; clear cell carcinoma; colon adenocarcinoma; consensus development; cutaneous melanoma; cystadenocarcinoma; diagnostic accuracy; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; endometrium carcinoma; esophagus carcinoma; frozen section; germ cell tumor; glioblastoma; glioma; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; histopathology; human; human tissue; invasive carcinoma; liver cell carcinoma; lung adenocarcinoma; major clinical study; malignant neoplasm; mesothelioma; pancreas adenocarcinoma; paraganglioma; pheochromocytoma; priority journal; prostate adenocarcinoma; rectum carcinoma; renal cell carcinoma; retrospective study; sarcoma; search engine; squamous cell lung carcinoma; stomach adenocarcinoma; testis tumor; thymoma; thyroid carcinoma; transitional cell carcinoma; uterine cervix carcinoma; uterus sarcoma; uvea melanoma; Pathology","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087279403"

Using convolutional neural networks on a large new dataset, we show that deep learning applied to echocardiography can identify local cardiac structures, estimate cardiac function, and predict systemic phenotypes that modify cardiovascular risk but not readily identifiable to human interpretation. Our deep learning model, EchoNet, accurately identified the presence of pacemaker leads (AUC = 0.89), enlarged left atrium (AUC = 0.86), left ventricular hypertrophy (AUC = 0.75), left ventricular end systolic and diastolic volumes (R2 = 0.74 and R2 = 0.70), and ejection fraction (R2 = 0.50), as well as predicted systemic phenotypes of age (R2 = 0.46), sex (AUC = 0.88), weight (R2 = 0.56), and height (R2 = 0.33). Interpretation analysis validates that EchoNet shows appropriate attention to key cardiac structures when performing human-explainable tasks and highlights hypothesis-generating regions of interest when predicting systemic phenotypes difficult for human interpretation.

Hip fractures are also the most commonly missed diagnosis on pelvic radiographs, and delayed diagnosis leads to higher cost and worse outcomes. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithms have shown promise for helping radiologists detect fractures, but the image features underpinning their predictions are notoriously difficult to understand. In this study, we trained deep-learning models on 17,587 radiographs to classify fracture, 5 patient traits, and 14 hospital process variables. All 20 variables could be individually predicted from a radiograph, with the best performances on scanner model (AUC = 1.00), scanner brand (AUC = 0.98), and whether the order was marked “priority” (AUC = 0.79). Fracture was predicted moderately well from the image (AUC = 0.78) and better when combining image features with patient data (AUC = 0.86, DeLong paired AUC comparison, p = 2e-9) or patient data plus hospital process features (AUC = 0.91, p = 1e-21). Fracture prediction on a test set that balanced fracture risk across patient variables was significantly lower than a random test set (AUC = 0.67, DeLong unpaired AUC comparison, p = 0.003); and on a test set with fracture risk balanced across patient and hospital process variables, the model performed randomly (AUC = 0.52, 95% CI 0.46–0.58), indicating that these variables were the main source of the model’s fracture predictions. A single model that directly combines image features, patient, and hospital process data outperforms a Naive Bayes ensemble of an image-only model prediction, patient, and hospital process data. If CAD algorithms are inexplicably leveraging patient and process variables in their predictions, it is unclear how radiologists should interpret their predictions in the context of other known patient data. Further research is needed to illuminate deep-learning decision processes so that computers and clinicians can effectively cooperate. © 2019, The Author(s).","Computer aided diagnosis; Deep learning; Forecasting; Fracture; Hospital data processing; Radiography; Causes of death; Diagnosis algorithms; Fracture prediction; Fracture risks; Hip fracture; Image features; Patient data; Process data; Process Variables; Test sets; adult; algorithm; area under the curve; Article; Bayesian learning; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; comparative study; computer aided design; computer aided diagnosis; controlled study; deep learning; diagnostic test; female; health care; hip fracture; hospital care; human; image analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; patient coding; patient risk; prevalence; priority journal; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; Hospitals","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135599187"

To date, GPS data have been reported in a few studies of schizophrenia, yet it is unclear whether these data correlate with concurrent momentary reports of location, vary by people with schizophrenia and healthy comparison subjects, or associate with symptom clusters in schizophrenia. A total of 142 participants with schizophrenia (n = 86) or healthy comparison subjects (n = 56) completed 7 days of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) reports of location and behavior, and simultaneous GPS locations were tracked every five minutes. We found that GPS-derived indicators of average distance travelled overall and distance from home, as well as percent of GPS samples at home were highly correlated with EMA reports of location at the day- and week-averaged level. GPS-based mobility indicators were lower in schizophrenia with medium to large effect sizes. Less GPS mobility was related to greater negative symptom severity, particularly diminished motivation, whereas greater GPS mobility was weakly associated with more community functioning. Neurocognition, depression, and positive symptoms were not associated with mobility indicators. Therefore, passive GPS sensing could provide a low-burden proxy measure of important outcomes in schizophrenia, including negative symptoms and possibly of functioning. As such, passive GPS sensing could be used for monitoring and timely interventions for negative symptoms in young persons at high risk for schizophrenia. © 2019, The Author(s).","Diseases; Global positioning system; biological marker; Average Distance; Case-control study; Chronic illness; Effect size; Highly-correlated; Mental health; Physical health; Satellite data; Satellite sensing; Satellite sensors; adult; aged; Article; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; Calgary Depression Scale; case control study; cognition; controlled study; depression; ecological momentary assessment; educational status; employment status; female; global positioning system; home care; human; independent living; major clinical study; male; motivation; negative syndrome; positive syndrome; priority journal; schizophrenia; Location","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101862924"

However, evidence regarding their accuracy remains lacking. Here we evaluated the effectiveness of modern digital technologies to simulate the everyday difficulties caused by glaucoma. 23 normally sighted adults performed two everyday tasks that glaucoma patients often report difficulties with: a visual search task in which participants attempted to locate a mobile phone in virtual domestic environments (virtual reality (VR)), and a visual mobility task in which participants navigated a physical, room-scale environment, while impairments were overlaid using augmented reality (AR). On some trials, a gaze-contingent simulated scotoma—generated using perimetric data from a real patient with advanced glaucoma—was presented in either the superior or inferior hemifield. The main outcome measure was task completion time. Eye and head movements were also tracked and used to assess individual differences in looking behaviors. The results showed that the simulated impairments substantially impaired performance in both the VR (visual search) and AR (visual mobility) tasks (both P < 0.001). Furthermore, and in line with previous patient data: impairments were greatest when the simulated Visual Field Loss (VFL) was inferior versus superior (P < 0.001), participants made more eye and head movements in the inferior VFL condition (P < 0.001), and participants rated the inferior VFL condition as more difficult (P < 0.001). Notably, the difference in performance between the inferior and superior conditions was almost as great as the difference between a superior VFL and no impairment at all (VR: 71%; AR: 70%). We conclude that modern digital simulators are able to replicate and objectively quantify some of the key everyday difficulties associated with visual impairments. Advantages, limitations, and possible applications of current technologies are discussed.

Studies of tremors in clinical practice are limited in size and scope and depend on explicit tracking of tremor characteristics by clinicians. Data drawn from small numbers of patients observed in short-duration sessions pose challenges for understanding the nature and distribution of tremors over a large population. Methods are presented to estimate hand tremors based on anonymized computer mouse cursor movement data collected from millions of users of a web search engine. To determine the feasibility of using this signal for the estimation of the prevalence of tremors over a large population, the characteristics of tremor-like movements are computed and compared against user data that can be interpreted as self-reports, the findings of published clinical studies, and a target selection study where participants self-report hand tremors and known causes. The results demonstrate significant alignment between estimated tremors and both self-reports and clinical findings. Those with cursor tremor events are more likely to report tremor-related search interests. Variations in cursor tremor quantity and cursor tremor frequency with demographics mirror those from clinical studies. Distributions of cursor tremor frequencies vary as expected for different medical conditions. Overall, the study finds evidence for the validity of harnessing anonymized mouse cursor motion as a population-scale tremor sensor for epidemiologic studies.

However, the emergence of AI/ML in medicine also creates challenges, which regulators must pay attention to. Which medical AI/ML-based products should be reviewed by regulators? What evidence should be required to permit marketing for AI/ML-based software as a medical device (SaMD)? How can we ensure the safety and effectiveness of AI/ML-based SaMD that may change over time as they are applied to new data? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for example, has recently proposed a discussion paper to address some of these issues. But it misses an important point: we argue that regulators like the FDA need to widen their scope from evaluating medical AI/ML-based products to assessing systems. This shift in perspective—from a product view to a system view—is central to maximizing the safety and efficacy of AI/ML in health care, but it also poses significant challenges for agencies like the FDA who are used to regulating products, not systems. We offer several suggestions for regulators to make this challenging but important transition. © 2020, The Author(s).","Diagnosis; Learning systems; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence learning; Change-over time; Diagnoses of disease; Early diagnosis; Food and Drug Administration; Machine learning systems; Machine-learning; Medical Devices; Systems view; Treatment plans; algorithm; Article; artificial intelligence; device safety; Food and Drug Administration; health care cost; health care system; human; machine learning; medical decision making; practice guideline; priority journal; uncertainty; Health care","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087054864"

However, the assessment produces different results between embryologists and as a result, the success rate of IVF remains low. To overcome uncertainties in embryo quality, multiple embryos are often implanted resulting in undesired multiple pregnancies and complications. Unlike in other imaging fields, human embryology and IVF have not yet leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) for unbiased, automated embryo assessment. We postulated that an AI approach trained on thousands of embryos can reliably predict embryo quality without human intervention. We implemented an AI approach based on deep neural networks (DNNs) to select highest quality embryos using a large collection of human embryo time-lapse images (about 50,000 images) from a high-volume fertility center in the United States. We developed a framework (STORK) based on Google’s Inception model. STORK predicts blastocyst quality with an AUC of >0.98 and generalizes well to images from other clinics outside the US and outperforms individual embryologists. Using clinical data for 2182 embryos, we created a decision tree to integrate embryo quality and patient age to identify scenarios associated with pregnancy likelihood. Our analysis shows that the chance of pregnancy based on individual embryos varies from 13.8% (age ≥41 and poor-quality) to 66.3% (age <37 and good-quality) depending on automated blastocyst quality assessment and patient age. In conclusion, our AI-driven approach provides a reproducible way to assess embryo quality and uncovers new, potentially personalized strategies to select embryos. © 2019, The Author(s).","Deep neural networks; Obstetrics; Embryo quality; High quality; High volumes; Human embryo; Human intervention; Imaging fields; In-vitro; Time lapse images; Uncertainty; Vitro fertilization; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; automation; blastocyst; decision tree; deep learning; embryo; embryo transfer; high volume hospital; human; learning algorithm; live birth; multiple pregnancy; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; quality control; United States; Decision trees","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606146"

In current clinical practice, falls (and associated fall risk) are often self-reported after the “first fall”, delaying primary prevention of falls and development of targeted fall prevention interventions. Current methods for assessing falls risk can be subjective, inaccurate, have low inter-rater reliability, and do not address factors contributing to falls (poor balance, gait speed, transfers, turning). 8521 participants (72.7 ± 12.0 years, 5392 female) from six countries were assessed using a digital falls risk assessment protocol. Data consisted of wearable sensor data captured during the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test along with self-reported questionnaire data on falls risk factors, applied to previously trained and validated classifier models. We found that 25.8% of patients reported a fall in the previous 12 months, of the 74.6% of participants that had not reported a fall, 21.5% were found to have a high predicted risk of falls. Overall 26.2% of patients were predicted to be at high risk of falls. 29.8% of participants were found to have slow walking speed, while 19.8% had high gait variability and 17.5% had problems with transfers. We report an observational study of results obtained from a novel digital fall risk assessment protocol. This protocol is intended to support the early identification of older adults at risk of falls and inform the creation of appropriate personalized interventions to prevent falls. A population-based approach to management of falls using objective measures of falls risk and mobility impairment, may help reduce unnecessary outpatient and emergency department utilization by improving risk prediction and stratification, driving more patients towards clinical and community-based falls prevention activities. © 2019, The Author(s).","Accident prevention; Developing countries; Risk assessment; 'current; Assessment protocols; Clinical practices; Fall prevention; Fall risk; Health issues; Interrater reliability; Population health; Prevention of falls; Risks assessments; ADL disability; aged; Article; balance disorder; community care; dizziness; emergency ward; fall risk assessment; female; foot disease; frailty; health care utilization; high risk population; human; major clinical study; male; motor dysfunction; observational study; outpatient care; patient mobility; polypharmacy; population health; predictive value; primary medical care; priority journal; questionnaire; rehabilitation care; residential care; risk management; scoring system; secondary health care; unnecessary procedure; walking speed; Wearable sensors","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606269"

Menstrual cycle parameters, including menstruation, basal body temperature (BBT) and luteinising hormone (LH) tests as well as age and BMI were collected anonymously from real-world users of the Natural Cycles app. We analysed 612,613 ovulatory cycles with a mean length of 29.3 days from 124,648 users. The mean follicular phase length was 16.9 days (95% CI: 10–30) and mean luteal phase length was 12.4 days (95% CI: 7–17). Mean cycle length decreased by 0.18 days (95% CI: 0.17–0.18, R2 = 0.99) and mean follicular phase length decreased by 0.19 days (95% CI: 0.19–0.20, R2 = 0.99) per year of age from 25 to 45 years.

We present results from our iPhone study Autism & Beyond, built on ResearchKit’s open-source platform. The entire study—from an e-Consent process to stimuli presentation and data collection—was conducted within an iPhone-based app available in the Apple Store.

Digital interventions offer the means to potentially enhance user satisfaction with health coaching and improve efficiencies. We used a randomised controlled trial to test whether a digitally-enabled health coaching intervention that included an online dashboard and telephone health coaching improved user satisfaction and cost-efficiencies compared with a telephone only health coaching intervention. The primary outcome was satisfaction measured by Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). 103 participants with NDH were allocated to the telephone coaching only intervention and 106 participants with NDH were allocated to the digital and telephone coaching intervention. In an intention-to-treat analysis satisfaction was higher in participants allocated to the digital and telephone coaching intervention than those allocated to the telephone only intervention, but the difference was not significant. There were no significant differences between the groups on secondary outcomes (HbA1c, BMI, activation, depression, self-management, health status).

We hypothesized that machine learning algorithms could automatically analyze computed tomography (CT) of the head, prioritize radiology worklists and reduce time to diagnosis of ICH. 46,583 head CTs (~2 million images) acquired from 2007–2017 were collected from several facilities across Geisinger. A deep convolutional neural network was trained on 37,074 studies and subsequently evaluated on 9499 unseen studies. The predictive model was implemented prospectively for 3 months to re-prioritize “routine” head CT studies as “stat” on realtime radiology worklists if an ICH was detected. Time to diagnosis was compared between the re-prioritized “stat” and “routine” studies. A neuroradiologist blinded to the study reviewed false positive studies to determine whether the dictating radiologist overlooked ICH. The model achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.846 (0.837–0.856). During implementation, 94 of 347 “routine” studies were re-prioritized to “stat”, and 60/94 had ICH identified by the radiologist. Five new cases of ICH were identified, and median time to diagnosis was significantly reduced (p < 0.0001) from 512 to 19 min. In particular, one outpatient with vague symptoms on anti-coagulation was found to have an ICH which was treated promptly with reversal of anticoagulation, resulting in a good clinical outcome. Of the 34 false positives, the blinded over-reader identified four probable ICH cases overlooked in original interpretation. In conclusion, an artificial intelligence algorithm can prioritize radiology worklists to reduce time to diagnosis of new outpatient ICH by 96% and may also identify subtle ICH overlooked by radiologists. This demonstrates the positive impact of advanced machine learning in radiology workflow optimization. © 2018, The Author(s).","Computerized tomography; Deep neural networks; Learning algorithms; Radiation; Anti-coagulation; Clinical workflow; Computed tomography scan; Convolutional neural network; False positive; Intracranial hemorrhages; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Reduce time; Workflow integration; adult; Article; artificial neural network; brain hemorrhage; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; deep convolutional neural network; false positive result; female; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; neuroradiologist; outpatient; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; workflow; Radiology","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135599973"

For 1-month pre-intervention and post-intervention, their searches for health-promoting goods or services were recorded. Our results show that 48% of people who were exposed to the ads made future searches for weight loss information, compared with 32% of those in the control group—a 50% increase. The advertisements varied in efficacy. However, the effectiveness of the advertisements may be greatly improved by targeting individuals based on their lifestyle preferences and/or sociodemographic characteristics, which together explain 49% of the variation in response to the ads. These results demonstrate that online advertisements hold promise as a mechanism for changing population health behaviors. They also provide researchers powerful ways to measure and improve the effectiveness of online public health interventions.

Where, as in multiple sclerosis, the pathological process has a complex anatomical distribution, such changes are not easily detected by low-dimensional models in common use. This hinders our ability to detect treatment effects, both in the management of individual patients and in interventional trials. Here we compared the ability of conventional models to detect an imaging response to treatment against high-dimensional models incorporating a wide multiplicity of imaging factors. We used fully-automated image analysis to extract 144 regional, longitudinal trajectories of pre- and post- treatment changes in brain volume and disconnection in a cohort of 124 natalizumab-treated patients. Low- and high-dimensional models of the relationship between treatment and the trajectories of change were built and evaluated with machine learning, quantifying performance with receiver operating characteristic curves. Simulations of randomised controlled trials enrolling varying numbers of patients were used to quantify the impact of dimensionality on statistical efficiency. Compared to existing methods, high-dimensional models were superior in treatment response detection (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.890 [95% CI = 0.885–0.895] vs. 0.686 [95% CI = 0.679–0.693], P < 0.01]) and in statistical efficiency (achieved statistical power = 0.806 [95% CI = 0.698–0.872] vs. 0.508 [95% CI = 0.403–0.593] with number of patients enrolled = 50, at α = 0.01).

The deep learning system (DLS) recently showed promising diagnostic performance for diabetic retinopathy (DR). This study aims to use DLS as the grading tool, instead of human assessors, to determine the prevalence and the systemic cardiovascular risk factors for DR on fundus photographs, in patients with diabetes. This is a multi-ethnic (5 races), multi-site (8 datasets from Singapore, USA, Hong Kong, China and Australia), cross-sectional study involving 18,912 patients (n = 93,293 images). We compared these results and the time taken for DR assessment by DLS versus 17 human assessors – 10 retinal specialists/ophthalmologists and 7 professional graders). The estimation of DR prevalence between DLS and human assessors is comparable for any DR, referable DR and vision–threatening DR (VTDR) (Human assessors: 15.9, 6.5% and 4.1%; DLS: 16.1%, 6.4%, 3.7%). Both assessment methods identified similar risk factors (with comparable AUCs), including younger age, longer diabetes duration, increased HbA1c and systolic blood pressure, for any DR, referable DR and VTDR (p > 0.05). The total time taken for DLS to evaluate DR from 93,293 fundus photographs was ~1 month compared to 2 years for human assessors. In conclusion, the prevalence and systemic risk factors for DR in multi-ethnic population could be determined accurately using a DLS, in significantly less time than human assessors. This study highlights the potential use of AI for future epidemiology or clinical trials for DR grading in the global communities. © 2019, The Author(s).","Blood pressure; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Eye movements; Eye protection; Eye tracking; Photography; Risk assessment; Risk perception; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; Cardio-vascular risk factors; Condition; Diabetic retinopathy; Diagnostic performance; Epidemiological studies; Fundus photographs; Human assessors; Multi-site; Risk factors; Systemic risks; adult; Article; Australia; cardiovascular risk; China; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; cross-sectional study; deep learning; diabetic retinopathy; electric potential; ethnic difference; female; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; ophthalmologist; photography; prevalence; priority journal; retina image; Singapore; systolic blood pressure; United States; Grading","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606034"

However, a reduction in body movements may also occur in periods of intense cognitive activity, and the ubiquitous use of smartphones may capture these wakeful periods otherwise hidden in the standard measures of sleep. Here, we continuously captured the gross body movements using standard wrist-worn accelerometers to quantify sleep (actigraphy) and logged the timing of the day-to-day touchscreen events (‘tappigraphy’). Using these measures, we addressed how the gross body movements overlap with the cognitively engaging digital behaviour (from n = 79 individuals, accumulating ~1400 nights). We find that smartphone use was distributed across a broad spectrum of physical activity levels, but consistently peaked at rest. We estimated the putative sleep onset and wake-up times from the actigraphy data to find that these times were well correlated to the estimates from tappigraphy (R2 = 0.9 for sleep-onset time and wake-up time). However, actigraphy overestimated sleep as virtually all of the users used their phones during the putative sleep period. Interestingly, the probability of touches remained greater than zero for ~2 h after the putative sleep onset, and ~2 h before the putative wake-up time. Our findings suggest that touchscreen interactions are widely integrated into modern sleeping habits—surrounding both sleep onset and waking-up periods—yielding a new approach to measuring sleep.

In this commentary, we suggest that shifting from a perspective focused on “implementing” new digital tools in health care settings toward one focused on “service design” will help teams execute more successful digital technology adoption projects. We present value proposition design (VPD) as a service design strategy requiring that stakeholders are brutally honest in determining the value of a new digital tool for their everyday work. Incorporating a perspective focused on how the value proposition of a technology is understood by each team member, and implications for their work routines, will help project teams to better understand how services can be reinvented during technology adoption initiatives. We present the simple heuristic [Tool+Team+Routine] as a reminder of the central considerations that make up a service design initiative, and present an illustrative case scenario of designing the use of a digital care coordination platform in an actual digital technology adoption project. We conclude by outlining two important challenges that need to be addressed to advance service design approaches to technology adoption in health care. © 2018, The Author(s).","Behavioral research; Digital devices; Human resource management; Digital technologies; Digital tools; Health outcomes; Health services; Innovation design; Patient experiences; Service capacity; Services designs; Technology adoption; Value proposition; adoption; article; case report; clinical article; coordination; human; Health care","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135598352"

Particularly in psychiatry, objective, continuous quantitation using patients’ own devices may result in clinically useful markers that can be used to refine diagnostic processes, tailor treatment choices, improve condition monitoring for actionable outcomes, such as early signs of relapse, and develop new intervention models. If a principal goal for digital phenotyping is clinical improvement, research needs to attend now to factors that will help or hinder future clinical adoption. We identify four opportunities for research directed toward this goal: exploring intermediate outcomes and underlying disease mechanisms; focusing on purposes that are likely to be used in clinical practice; anticipating quality and safety barriers to adoption; and exploring the potential for digital personalized medicine arising from the integration of digital phenotyping and digital interventions. Clinical relevance also means explicitly addressing consumer needs, preferences, and acceptability as the ultimate users of digital phenotyping interventions. There is a risk that, without such considerations, the potential benefits of digital phenotyping are delayed or not realized because approaches that are feasible for application in healthcare, and the evidence required to support clinical commissioning, are not developed. Practical steps to accelerate this research agenda include the further development of digital phenotyping technology platforms focusing on scalability and equity, establishing shared data repositories and common data standards, and fostering multidisciplinary collaborations between clinical stakeholders (including patients), computer scientists, and researchers. © 2019, The Author(s).","Clinical research; Condition monitoring; Diagnosis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Safety engineering; Clinical practices; Diagnostic process; Intervention models; Personal electronic devices; Phenotyping; Quality and safeties; Research interests; Research needs; Safety barriers; Smart phones; bipolar disorder; clinical practice; computer scientist; consumer; drinking behavior; feasibility study; harm reduction; health care cost; health care organization; human; limit of quantitation; machine learning; mood disorder; personalized medicine; phenotype; primary medical care; priority journal; Review; risk factor; suicide; Patient treatment","Nature Publishing Group","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606001"

Photoplethysmography uses a noninvasive optical sensor incorporated in commercial smart watches to detect blood volume changes at the skin surface. In this study, we obtained photoplethysmography recordings and echocardiograms from 19 HCM patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (oHCM) and a control cohort of 64 healthy volunteers. Automated analysis showed a significant difference in oHCM patients for 38/42 morphometric pulse wave features, including measures of systolic ejection time, rate of rise during systole, and respiratory variation. We developed a machine learning classifier that achieved a C-statistic for oHCM detection of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99–1.0).

The intervention was optimised based on feedback on a prototype intervention through interviews (N = 96) with cancer survivors and focus groups with NHS staff and cancer charity workers (N = 31). Interviews with cancer survivors highlighted barriers to engagement, such as concerns about physical activity worsening fatigue. Focus groups highlighted concerns about support appointment length and how to support distressed participants. Feedback informed intervention modifications, to maximise acceptability, feasibility and likelihood of behaviour change. Our systematic method for understanding user views enabled us to anticipate and address important barriers to engagement.

The widespread growth of prescribing and consuming medications has increased the need for applications that support medication reconciliation. We show a deep-learning application that can help reduce avoidable errors with their attendant risk, i.e., correctly identifying prescription medication, which is currently a tedious and error-prone task. We demonstrate prescription-pill identification from mobile images in the NIH NLM Pill Image Recognition Challenge dataset. Our application recognizes the correct pill within the top-5 results at 94% accuracy, which compares favorably to the original competition winner at 83.3% for top-5 under comparable, though not identical configurations. The Institute of Medicine claims that better use of information technology can be an important step in reducing medication errors. Therefore, we believe that a more immediate impact of AI in healthcare will occur with a seamless integration of AI into clinical workflows, readily addressing the quadruple aim of healthcare. © 2019, The Author(s).","Computer aided instruction; Controlled drug delivery; Deep learning; Errors; Image recognition; Information use; Targeted drug delivery; 'current; Attendant risk; Causes of death; Clinical settings; Drug-allergy; Error prone tasks; Heart disease; Medical errors; Medication errors; Treatment plans; Article; deep learning; drug hypersensitivity; human; information technology; medical error; medication therapy management; priority journal; Diseases","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606248"

However, this highly desirable approach is beyond the capability of human vision. We developed a deep learning approach for automatically determining the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and CKD status. We exploited the transfer learning technique, integrating the powerful ResNet model pretrained on an ImageNet dataset in our neural network architecture, to predict kidney function based on 4,505 kidney ultrasound images labeled using eGFRs derived from serum creatinine concentrations. To further extract the information from ultrasound images, we leveraged kidney length annotations to remove the peripheral region of the kidneys and applied various data augmentation schemes to produce additional data with variations. Bootstrap aggregation was also applied to avoid overfitting and improve the model’s generalization. Moreover, the kidney function features obtained by our deep neural network were used to identify the CKD status defined by an eGFR of <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.741 indicated the strong relationship between artificial intelligence (AI)- and creatinine-based GFR estimations. Overall CKD status classification accuracy of our model was 85.6% —higher than that of experienced nephrologists (60.3%–80.1%). Our model is the first fundamental step toward realizing the potential of transforming kidney ultrasound imaging into an effective, real-time, distant screening tool. AI-GFR estimation offers the possibility of noninvasive assessment of kidney function, a key goal of AI-powered functional automation in clinical practice. © 2019, The Author(s).","Creatinine; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Network architecture; Noninvasive medical procedures; Porosity; Ultrasonic imaging; creatinine; Chronic kidney disease; Clinical practices; Function prediction; Glomerular filtration rate; Human vision; Kidney function; Learning approach; Transfer learning; Ultrasound images; Ultrasound imaging; aged; Article; artificial intelligence; automation; chronic kidney failure; controlled study; creatinine blood level; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; echography; estimated glomerular filtration rate; feature extraction; female; human; intermethod comparison; kidney function; kidney size; learning algorithm; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; nephrologist; priority journal; Correlation methods","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606247"

Wireless wearable sensors are a promising alternative for their portability and access to high-resolution data for customizable analytics.

While the duty hours metric measures hours worked, it does not capture differences in intensity of work completed during those hours, which may independently contribute to fatigue and burnout. Few such metrics exist. Digital data streams generated during the usual course of hospital operations can serve as a novel source of insight into workload intensity by providing high-resolution, minute-by-minute data at the individual level; however, study and use of these data streams for workload monitoring has been limited to date.

Mean step count differed by age (20–39 years: 4071 vs. 40–69 years: 2394, p < 0.01), diagnostic delay (<10 years: 3584 vs. ≥10 years: 2232, p < 0.05), disease duration (<10 years: 4219 vs. ≥10 years: 2462, p < 0.05), and ambulatory status (aided: 1883 vs. unaided: 3408, p < 0.05). Patient-reported “fatigue and pain” score was inversely correlated with step count (Pearson’s r = −0.42, p < 0.05) and peak 1-min activity (Pearson’s r = −0.49, p < 0.01).

In this study, we exploit social media on a larger scale by developing natural language processing (NLP) methods to automatically detect, among thousands of users, a cohort of mothers reporting that their child has a birth defect. We used 22,999 annotated tweets to train and evaluate supervised machine learning algorithms—feature-engineered and deep learning-based classifiers—that automatically distinguish tweets referring to the user’s pregnancy outcome from tweets that merely mention birth defects. Because 90% of the tweets merely mention birth defects, we experimented with under-sampling and over-sampling approaches to address this class imbalance. An SVM classifier achieved the best performance for the two positive classes: an F1-score of 0.65 for the “defect” class and 0.51 for the “possible defect” class. We deployed the classifier on 20,457 unlabeled tweets that mention birth defects, which helped identify 542 additional users for potential inclusion in our cohort. Contributions of this study include (1) NLP methods for automatically detecting tweets by users reporting their birth defect outcomes, (2) findings that an SVM classifier can outperform a deep neural network-based classifier for highly imbalanced social media data, (3) evidence that automatic classification can be used to identify additional users for potential inclusion in our cohort, and (4) a publicly available corpus for training and evaluating supervised machine learning algorithms. © 2019, The Author(s).","Classification (of information); Defects; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Obstetrics; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; Birth defects; Defect class; Language processing; Machine learning algorithms; Natural languages; Processing method; Scalings; Social media; Supervised machine learning; SVM classifiers; Article; Bayesian learning; classifier; cohort analysis; congenital malformation; deep learning; deep neural network; human; learning algorithm; long short term memory network; natural language processing; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; social media; supervised machine learning; support vector machine; Deep neural networks","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606378"

These technologies have generated a lot of “hype,” but their real-world effectiveness will depend on patients’ uptake. Our objective was to describe patients’ perceptions of the use of BMDs and AI in healthcare. We recruited adult patients with chronic conditions in France from the “Community of Patients for Research” (ComPaRe). Participants (1) answered quantitative and open-ended questions about the potential benefits and dangers of using of these new technologies and (2) participated in a case-vignette experiment to assess their readiness for using BMDs and AI in healthcare. Vignettes covered the use of AI to screen for skin cancer, remote monitoring of chronic conditions to predict exacerbations, smart clothes to guide physical therapy, and AI chatbots to answer emergency calls. A total of 1183 patients (51% response rate) were enrolled between May and June 2018. Overall, 20% considered that the benefits of technology (e.g., improving the reactivity in care and reducing the burden of treatment) greatly outweighed the dangers. Only 3% of participants felt that negative aspects (inadequate replacement of human intelligence, risks of hacking and misuse of private patient data) greatly outweighed potential benefits. We found that 35% of patients would refuse to integrate at least one existing or soon-to-be available intervention using BMDs and AI-based tools in their care. Accounting for patients’ perspectives will help make the most of technology without impairing the human aspects of care, generating a burden or intruding on patients’ lives. © 2019, The Author(s).","Hospital data processing; Personal computing; Wearable technology; Biometric monitoring; Chronic conditions; Measurement and analysis; Monitoring device; Patient data; Potential benefits; Real- time; Remote analysis; Remote measurement; Wearable devices; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; disease exacerbation; emergency care; female; health care; human; major clinical study; male; medical technology; mobile application; patient coding; perception; physiotherapy; priority journal; remote sensing; skin cancer; vignette; Patient treatment","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606015"

However, the potential of the more than 3.6 billion radiology examinations performed annually worldwide has largely gone unused in the effort to digitally transform health care. The Bionic Radiologist is a concept that combines humanity and digitalization for better health care integration of radiology. At a practical level, this concept will achieve critical goals: (1) testing decisions being made scientifically on the basis of disease probabilities and patient preferences; (2) image analysis done consistently at any time and at any site; and (3) treatment suggestions that are closely linked to imaging results and are seamlessly integrated with other information. The Bionic Radiologist will thus help avoiding missed care opportunities, will provide continuous learning in the work process, and will also allow more time for radiologists’ primary roles: interacting with patients and referring physicians. To achieve that potential, one has to cope with many implementation barriers at both the individual and institutional levels. These include: reluctance to delegate decision making, a possible decrease in image interpretation knowledge and the perception that patient safety and trust are at stake. To facilitate implementation of the Bionic Radiologist the following will be helpful: uncertainty quantifications for suggestions, shared decision making, changes in organizational culture and leadership style, maintained expertise through continuous learning systems for training, and role development of the involved experts. With the support of the Bionic Radiologist, disparities are reduced and the delivery of care is provided in a humane and personalized fashion. © 2019, The Author(s).","Bionics; Decision making; Image analysis; Learning systems; Patient treatment; Radiation; nicotinic acid; Continuous learning; Critical goal; Decisions makings; Image interpretation; Image-analysis; Implementation barriers; Patient preferences; Patient safety; Radiology examinations; Work process; bionic radiologist; digitalization; health care delivery; human; image analysis; learning; patient safety; priority journal; radiologist; radiology; Review; shared decision making; trust; Radiology","Nature Publishing Group","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606017"

Simple screening strategies have false positive rates greater than 95%. As part of the FH Foundation′s FIND FH initiative, we developed a classifier to identify potential FH patients using electronic health record (EHR) data at Stanford Health Care. We trained a random forest classifier using data from known patients (n = 197) and matched non-cases (n = 6590). Our classifier obtained a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.88 and sensitivity of 0.75 on a held-out test-set. We evaluated the accuracy of the classifier′s predictions by chart review of 100 patients at risk of FH not included in the original dataset. The classifier correctly flagged 84% of patients at the highest probability threshold, with decreasing performance as the threshold lowers. In external validation on 466 FH patients (236 with genetically proven FH) and 5000 matched non-cases from the Geisinger Healthcare System our FH classifier achieved a PPV of 0.85. Our EHR-derived FH classifier is effective in finding candidate patients for further FH screening.

Earlier starting age of therapy is a strong predictor of later success, but waitlists for therapies can be 18 months long. To address these complications, we developed Superpower Glass, a machine-learning-assisted software system that runs on Google Glass and an Android smartphone, designed for use during social interactions. This pilot exploratory study examines our prototype tool’s potential for social-affective learning for children with autism. We sent our tool home with 14 families and assessed changes from intake to conclusion through the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2), a facial affect recognition task (EGG), and qualitative parent reports. A repeated-measures one-way ANOVA demonstrated a decrease in SRS-2 total scores by an average 7.14 points (F(1,13) = 33.20, p = <.001, higher scores indicate higher ASD severity). EGG scores also increased by an average 9.55 correct responses (F(1,10) = 11.89, p = <.01). Parents reported increased eye contact and greater social acuity.

Data were analyzed using the Intel® Pharma Analytics Platform. Clinicians reviewed participants’ data in a dashboard during in-office visits at 2 weeks, 1, 3, and 6 months. Clinicians provided feedback in focus groups leading to dashboard updates. Between June and August 2017, 51 PD patients were recruited at four US sites, and 39 (76%) completed the 6-month study. Patients streamed 83,432 h of movement data from their smartwatches (91% of expected). Reporting of symptoms and medication intake using the app was lower than expected, 44% and 60%, respectively, but did not differ according to baseline characteristics. Clinicians’ feedback resulted in ten updates to the dashboard during the study period. Clinicians reported that medications and patient reported outcomes were generally discernable in the dashboard and complementary to clinical assessments. Movement, symptoms, and medication intake data were feasibly translated from the app into a clinician dashboard but there was substantial attrition rate over 6 months.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of routinely collected administrative data for 13,105,996 admissions across 136 hospitals in England from 2015 to 2016. Data from the 2016 NHS Clinical Digital Maturity Index were used to characterise organisational digital maturity. A multivariable regression model including 12 institutional covariates was utilised to examine the relationship between one measure of organisational digital maturity and five key clinical outcome measures. There was no significant relationship between organisational digital maturity and risk-adjusted 30-day mortality, 28-day readmission rates or complications of care. In multivariable analysis risk-adjusted long length of stay and harm-free care were significantly related to aspects of organisational digital maturity; digitally mature hospitals may not only deliver more harm-free care episodes but also may have a significantly increased risk of patients experiencing a long length of stay. Organisational digital maturity is to some extent related to selected clinical outcomes in secondary care in England. Digital maturity is, however, also strongly linked to other institutional factors that likely play a greater role in influencing clinical outcomes. There is a need to better understand how health IT impacts care delivery and supports other drivers of hospital quality. © 2019, The Author(s).","Health; Regression analysis; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Clinical outcome; England; Health informations; Healthcare systems; High quality; Length of stay; Long lengths; National health services; Organisational; Risk-adjusted; Article; clinical outcome; England; health care delivery; health care quality; health care system; hospital admission; hospital readmission; human; length of stay; major clinical study; medical informatics; mortality; national health service; organizational development; patient care; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; secondary health care; Hospitals","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091124124"

Alarm fatigue is well recognized but no solution has been widely successful. Physiologic patient monitors are responsible for the lion’s share of alarms at the bedside, most of which are either false or non-actionable. Algorithms on patient monitors lack precision because they fail to leverage multivariate relationship among variables monitored, to integrate rich patient clinical information from electronic health record system, and to utilize temporal patterns in data streams. Therefore, a solution to patient monitor alarm fatigue is to open the black-box of patient monitors to integrate physiologic data with clinical data from EHR under a four-element algorithm strategy to be described in this paper. This strategy will be presented in this paper in the context of its current status as described in our prior publications. © 2019, The Author(s).","Alarm systems; Physiology; Black boxes; Building element; Clinical information; Connected healthcares; Data stream; Electronic health; Fatigue problems; Health records; Monitoring algorithms; Temporal pattern; algorithm; electronic health record; fatigue; human; patient monitoring; priority journal; Review; Patient monitoring","Nature Publishing Group","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089605930"

Accurate stratification of absence risk can maximize the yield of preventative interventions. The wide multiplicity of potential causes, and the poor performance of systems based on simple, linear, low-dimensional models, suggests complex predictive models of attendance are needed. Here, we quantify the effect of using complex, non-linear, high-dimensional models enabled by machine learning. Models systematically varying in complexity based on logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, AdaBoost, or gradient boosting machines were trained and evaluated on an unselected set of 22,318 consecutive scheduled magnetic resonance imaging appointments at two UCL hospitals. High-dimensional Gradient Boosting Machine-based models achieved the best performance reported in the literature, exhibiting an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.852 and average precision of 0.511. Optimal predictive performance required 81 variables. Simulations showed net potential benefit across a wide range of attendance characteristics, peaking at £3.15 per appointment at current prevalence and call efficiency. Optimal attendance prediction requires more complex models than have hitherto been applied in the field, reflecting the complex interplay of patient, environmental, and operational causal factors. Far from an exotic luxury, high-dimensional models based on machine learning are likely essential to optimal scheduling amongst other operational aspects of hospital care. High predictive performance is achievable with data from a single institution, obviating the need for aggregating large-scale sensitive data across governance boundaries. © 2019, The Author(s).","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Support vector machines; Clinical management; Gradient boosting; High-dimensional models; Machine-learning; National health services; Performance of systems; Poor performance; Predictive performance; Simplest linear; United kingdom; adult; article; artificial intelligence; female; hospital care; human; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prediction; prevalence; quantitative analysis; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; simulation; support vector machine; Hospitals","Nature Research","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606060"

This system provides a signal from an ingested sensor contained in the dosage form to a patient-worn patch and transmits this signal via the patient’s mobile device. A previously developed hybrid Markov-von Mises model was used to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates for medication ingestion behavior parameters for individual patients. The individual parameter estimates were modeled to obtain distribution parameters of priors implemented in a Markov chain-Monte Carlo framework. Clinical and demographic covariates associated with model ingestion parameters were also assessed. We obtained individual estimates of overall observed ingestion percent (median:75.9%, range:18.2–98.3%, IQR:32.9%), rate of excess dosing events (median:0%, range:0–14.3%, IQR:3.0%) and observed ingestion duration. The modeling also provided estimates of the Markov-dependence probabilities of dosing success following a dosing success or failure. The ingestion-timing deviations were modeled with the von Mises distribution. A subset of 17 patients (22.1%) were identified as prompt correctors based on Markov-dependence probability of a dosing failure followed by a dosing success of unity. The prompt corrector sub-group had a better overall digital medicine ingestion parameter profile compared to those who were not prompt correctors. Our results demonstrate the potential utility of a Bayesian Hybrid Markov-von Mises model for characterizing digital medicine ingestion patterns in patients with SMI. © 2019, The Author(s).","Markov processes; Maximum likelihood estimation; Parameter estimation; Patient treatment; aripiprazole; Bayesian; Behavior parameters; Clinical study; Dosage forms; Hybrid model; Maximum-likelihood estimate; Mental illness; Parameters estimates; Performance; Von Mises; adult; Article; Bayes theorem; bayesian hybrid model; computer assisted therapy; critically ill patient; data compression; demography; digital medicine system; evaluation study; female; human; information processing; ingestion; major clinical study; male; Markov chain; mental disease; middle aged; Monte Carlo method; priority journal; signal detection; Diseases","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606061"

Here we develop a large-scale algorithm to automatically predict all 4577 standard veterinary diagnosis codes from free text. We train our algorithm on a curated dataset of over 100 K expert labeled veterinary notes and over one million unlabeled notes. Our algorithm is based on the adapted Transformer architecture and we demonstrate that large-scale language modeling on the unlabeled notes via pretraining and as an auxiliary objective during supervised learning greatly improves performance. We systematically evaluate the performance of the model and several baselines in challenging settings where algorithms trained on one hospital are evaluated in a different hospital with substantial domain shift. In addition, we show that hierarchical training can address severe data imbalances for fine-grained diagnosis with a few training cases, and we provide interpretation for what is learned by the deep network.

This offers clinicians the opportunity to more carefully tailor early interventions— whether treatment or preventative in nature—to each individual patient. Taking advantage of high performance computer capabilities, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can now achieve reasonable success in predicting risk in certain cancers and cardiovascular disease from available multidimensional clinical and biological data. In contrast, less progress has been made with the neurodevelopmental disorders, which include intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy and broader neurodevelopmental disorders. Much hope is pinned on the opportunity to quantify risk from patterns of genomic variation, including the functional characterization of genes and variants, but this ambition is confounded by phenotypic and etiologic heterogeneity, along with the rare and variable penetrant nature of the underlying risk variants identified so far. Structural and functional brain imaging and neuropsychological and neurophysiological markers may provide further dimensionality, but often require more development to achieve sensitivity for diagnosis. Herein, therefore, lies a precision medicine conundrum: can artificial intelligence offer a breakthrough in predicting risks and prognosis for neurodevelopmental disorders?

However, as researchers, technology developers, disease-focused groups, and others forge forward to take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in this domain, it is important to avoid hype and overpromising, and to ensure that this work is done rigorously and collaboratively. In June 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders hosted a workshop that brought together a wide range of experts and stakeholders. The workshop provided an opportunity to take stock of the rapidly-evolving landscape and discuss how to work together to address both scientific and practical challenges, so that the potential of digital technologies can be translated into meaningful contributions toward the health of individuals and society. Workshop presentations and discussions focused on four key challenges: transforming data into insight, navigating regulatory pathways, designing user-centered tools, and building partnerships across a complex ecosystem. This article highlights the many issues, challenges, and opportunities discussed by individual participants at the workshop. © 2019, The Author(s).","Wearable technology; Alzheimer; Brain disorders; Complex ecosystems; Digital technologies; National Academy of Science; Regulatory pathway; Smart phones; Social media datum; User-centered tools; brain disease; digital technology; human; priority journal; Review; technology; Metadata","Nature Publishing Group","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606116"

Using biosensor, biomarkers, and patient-reported outcomes in participants with stable ischemic heart disease, the PRE-MACE study is designed to measure cross-sectional correlations and establish the ability of remote monitoring to predict major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) biomarkers and incident MACE at baseline and 12-month follow-up. It will further assess the adherence and cost-effectiveness of remote monitoring and blood sampling over the initial months. Despite medication and lifestyle changes, patients with cardiovascular disease can experience MACE due to undertreatment, poor adherence, or failure to recognize clinical or biochemical changes that presage MACE. Identifying patients using remote monitoring to detect MACE forerunners has potential to improve outcomes, avoid MACE, and reduce resource utilization. Data collection will include: (1) continuous remote monitoring using wearable biosensors; (2) biomarker measurements using plasma and at-home micro-sampling blood collection; and (3) patient-reported outcomes to monitor perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life. Two hundred participants will be followed for 90 days with a subset (n = 80) monitored for 180 days. All participants will be followed up for MACE at 12 months.The PRE-MACE study will utilize remote monitoring with biosensors, biomarkers, and patient-reported outcomes to identify intermediate biomarkers of MACE in patients with stable ischemic heart disease.

This study examined the claims invoked through these app store descriptions, the extent to which scientific language is used to support such claims, and the corresponding evidence in the literature. Google Play and iTunes were searched for apps related to depression, self-harm, substance use, anxiety, and schizophrenia. The descriptions of the top-ranking, consumer-focused apps were coded to identify claims of acceptability and effectiveness, and forms of supporting statement. For apps which invoked ostensibly scientific principles, a literature search was conducted to assess their credibility. Seventy-three apps were coded, and the majority (64%) claimed effectiveness at diagnosing a mental health condition, or improving symptoms, mood or self-management. Scientific language was most frequently used to support these effectiveness claims (44%), although this included techniques not validated by literature searches (8/24 = 33%). Two apps described low-quality, primary evidence to support the use of the app. Only one app included a citation to published literature. A minority of apps (14%) described design or development involving lived experience, and none referenced certification or accreditation processes such as app libraries. Scientific language was the most frequently invoked form of support for use of mental health apps; however, high-quality evidence is not commonly described. Improved knowledge translation strategies may improve the adoption of other strategies, such as certification or lived experience co-design. © 2019, The Author(s).","Health; App stores; Consumer choice; Google plays; Health condition; Literature search; Mental health; Scientific language; Scientific principles; Substance use; Symptom management; accreditation; anxiety; Article; automutilation; certification; consumer; depression; evaluation study; human; mental health; mobile application; mood; priority journal; program acceptability; schizophrenia; science; self care; substance use; Libraries","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606352"

The emergence of flexible and stretchable electronics coupled with the ability to quantify biochemical analytes and physiological parameters have enabled the detection of key markers indicative of performance and stress, as reviewed in this paper. © 2019, The Author(s).","Flexible electronics; Physiological models; Physiology; Recovery; Sports; biological marker; biological marker; chloride; chloride; glucose; glucose; hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone; lactic acid; lactic acid; orexin; orexin; potassium; potassium; sodium; sodium; Analytes; Competitive edges; Medical needs; Medical personnel; Performance; Physiological parameters; Recovery protocols; Stretchable electronics; athlete; athlete; biological monitoring; biological monitoring; electrodermal response; electrodermal response; heart rate variability; heart rate variability; human; human; mental health; mental health; mental stress; mental stress; physiological process; physiological process; priority journal; priority journal; Review; Review; saliva; saliva; skin conductance; skin conductance; sport; sport; sweat; sweat; sweating; sweating; Wearable sensors","Nature Publishing Group","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606190"

Electronic health records are valuable sources of real-world evidence for assessing device safety and tracking device-related patient outcomes over time. However, distilling this evidence remains challenging, as information is fractured across clinical notes and structured records. Modern machine learning methods for machine reading promise to unlock increasingly complex information from text, but face barriers due to their reliance on large and expensive hand-labeled training sets. To address these challenges, we developed and validated state-of-the-art deep learning methods that identify patient outcomes from clinical notes without requiring hand-labeled training data. Using hip replacements—one of the most common implantable devices—as a test case, our methods accurately extracted implant details and reports of complications and pain from electronic health records with up to 96.3% precision, 98.5% recall, and 97.4% F1, improved classification performance by 12.8–53.9% over rule-based methods, and detected over six times as many complication events compared to using structured data alone. Using these additional events to assess complication-free survivorship of different implant systems, we found significant variation between implants, including for risk of revision surgery, which could not be detected using coded data alone. Patients with revision surgeries had more hip pain mentions in the post-hip replacement, pre-revision period compared to patients with no evidence of revision surgery (mean hip pain mentions 4.97 vs. 3.23; t = 5.14; p < 0.001). Some implant models were associated with higher or lower rates of hip pain mentions. Our methods complement existing surveillance mechanisms by requiring orders of magnitude less hand-labeled training data, offering a scalable solution for national medical device surveillance using electronic health records. © 2019, The Author(s).","Implants (surgical); Monitoring; Records management; Risk assessment; Clinical notes; Electronic health; Health care providers; Health records; Hip replacements; Labeled training data; Medical Devices; Real-world; Regulatory agencies; Revision surgery; Deep learning","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089605932"

Multidisciplinary pain treatment (MPT) programs comprising educational, physical, and psychological interventions have shown positive treatment effects on LBP. Nonetheless, such programs are costly and treatment opportunities are often limited to specialized medical centers. mHealth and other digital interventions may be a promising method to successfully support patient self-management in LBP. To address these issues, we investigated the clinical effects of a multidisciplinary mHealth back pain App (Kaia App) in a randomized controlled trial (registered at German Clinical Trials Register under DRKS00016329). One-hundred one adult patients with non-specific LBP from 6 weeks to 1 year were randomly assigned to an intervention group or a control group. In the intervention group, the Kaia App was provided for 3 months. Control treatment consisted of six individual physiotherapy sessions over 6 weeks and high-quality online education. The primary outcome, pain intensity, was assessed at 12-week follow-up on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS). Our per-protocol analysis showed no significant differences between the groups at baseline (Kaia App group: M = 5.10 (SD = 1.07) vs. control group: M = 5.41 (SD = 1.15). At 12-week follow-up the Kaia App group reported significantly lower pain intensity (M = 2.70 (SD = 1.51)) compared to the control group (M = 3.40 (SD = 1.63)).

Here, we report results from a survey of 487 pathologist-respondents practicing in 54 countries, conducted to examine perspectives on AI implementation in clinical practice. Despite limitations, including difficulty with quantifying response bias and verifying identity of respondents to this anonymous and voluntary survey, several interesting findings were uncovered. Overall, respondents carried generally positive attitudes towards AI, with nearly 75% reporting interest or excitement in AI as a diagnostic tool to facilitate improvements in workflow efficiency and quality assurance in pathology. Importantly, even within the more optimistic cohort, a significant number of respondents endorsed concerns about AI, including the potential for job displacement and replacement. Overall, around 80% of respondents predicted the introduction of AI technology in the pathology laboratory within the coming decade. Attempts to identify statistically significant demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, type/place of practice) predictive of attitudes towards AI using Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) testing revealed several associations.

Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data principles may aid toward Web-scale semantic processing and data integration in biomedicine.

This intuition breaks down in higher dimensions when multiple measurements are combined: fewer individuals are close to average for many measurements simultaneously than for any single measurement alone. This phenomenon is known as the curse of dimensionality. In medicine, diagnostic sophistication generally increases through the addition of more predictive factors. Disease classes themselves become more dissimilar as a result, increasing the difficulty of incorporating (i.e., averaging) multiple patients into a single class for guiding treatment of new patients. Failure to consider the curse of dimensionality will ultimately lead to inherent limits on the degree to which precision medicine can extend the advances of evidence-based medicine for selecting suitable treatments. One strategy to compensate for the curse of dimensionality involves incorporating predictive observation models into the patient workup. © 2019, The Author(s).","Patient treatment; Break down; Curse of dimensionality; Evidence-based medicine; Higher dimensions; Multiple measurements; Observation model; One-dimensional; Predictive factors; clinical observation; clinical outcome; diagnostic accuracy; evidence based medicine; human; Note; patient assessment; patient care; personalized medicine; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; anthropometry; autism; dementia; effect size; environmental factor; evidence based medicine; genetics; lifestyle; malignant neoplasm; medical decision making; pensioner; public health; risk factor; smoking; treatment outcome; Diagnosis","Nature Publishing Group","Note","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606322"

Our system was developed using 112 million pathologist-annotated image patches from 1226 slides, and evaluated on an independent validation dataset of 331 slides. Compared to a reference standard provided by genitourinary pathology experts, the mean accuracy among 29 general pathologists was 0.61 on the validation set. The DLS achieved a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy of 0.70 (p = 0.002) and trended towards better patient risk stratification in correlations to clinical follow-up data. Our approach could improve the accuracy of Gleason scoring and subsequent therapy decisions, particularly where specialist expertise is unavailable.

Actigraphy, an alternative, has been proven cheap and relatively accurate. However, the largest experiments conducted to date, have had only hundreds of participants. In this work, we processed the data of the recently published Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to have both PSG and actigraphy data synchronized. We propose the adoption of this publicly available large dataset, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than any other dataset, to systematically compare existing methods for the detection of sleep-wake stages, thus fostering the creation of new algorithms. We also implemented and compared state-of-the-art methods to score sleep-wake stages, which range from the widely used traditional algorithms to recent machine learning approaches. We identified among the traditional algorithms, two approaches that perform better than the algorithm implemented by the actigraphy device used in the MESA Sleep experiments. The performance, in regards to accuracy and F1 score of the machine learning algorithms, was also superior to the device’s native algorithm and comparable to human annotation. Future research in developing new sleep-wake scoring algorithms, in particular, machine learning approaches, will be highly facilitated by the cohort used here. We exemplify this potential by showing that two particular deep-learning architectures, CNN and LSTM, among the many recently created, can achieve accuracy scores significantly higher than other methods for the same tasks. © 2019, The Author(s).","Learning algorithms; Long short-term memory; Patient monitoring; Sleep research; Wakes; Actigraphy; Large datasets; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning techniques; Orders of magnitude; Performance; Polysomnography; Sleep studies; Sleep/wake; State-of-the-art methods; actimetry; adult; aged; Article; assessment of humans; benchmarking; clinical evaluation; clinical protocol; cohort analysis; controlled study; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; human; human experiment; male; multi-- ethnic study of atherosclerosis sleep study; night sleep; normal human; perceptron; polysomnography; priority journal; REM sleep; sleep medicine; sleep pattern; sleep quality; sleep time; sleep waking cycle; stage 1 sleep; Large dataset","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089605996"

Digital treatment has the potential to address these barriers, yet long term use of digital psychotherapy is poor. This paper presents data from a mixed-methods, online survey to document concerns patients with depression face when given the choice of in-person psychotherapy and digital psychotherapy. Participants were 164 adults living in the United States who had previously used or considered psychotherapy for depression. Rural-dwelling and racial/ethnic minority (Native American, African American, and Spanish-speaking) respondents were purposively sampled. Participants were asked their preferences for and opinions about four treatment modalities: self-guided digital, peer-supported digital, expert-guided digital, or in-person psychotherapy. Less than half (44.5%) of participants preferred in-person psychotherapy, 25.6% preferred self-guided digital treatment, 19.7% preferred expert-guided digital treatment, and 8.5% peer-supported digital treatment. Principal themes extracted from qualitative analysis centered on the efficacy of digital treatment, access to digital treatment, concerns about peer-supported care, confidentiality and privacy concerns, preference for in-person treatment, skepticism about self-guided therapy, and the impact of social anxiety on the use of video-chat based care. Future development of digital psychotherapy will need to address concerns regarding efficacy, privacy, data security, and methods to enhance motivation to use these treatments. © 2019, The Author(s).","African American; Ethnic minorities; Mixed method; Native Americans; Online surveys; Privacy concerns; Qualitative analysis; Social anxieties; Treatment modality; Use of video; adult; African American; American Indian; anxiety; article; computer security; confidentiality; controlled study; ethnic group; female; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; motivation; privacy; psychotherapy; qualitative analysis; speech; United States; videorecording; Surveys","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606161"

However, realizing the potential of digital phenotyping requires understanding of the smartphone as a scientific data collection tool. In this pilot study, we detail a procedure for estimating data quality for phone sensor samples and model the relationship between data quality and future symptom-related survey responses in a cohort with schizophrenia. We find that measures of empirical coverage of collected accelerometer and GPS data, as well as survey timing and survey completion metrics, are significantly associated with future survey scores for a variety of symptom domains. We also find evidence that specific measures of data quality are indicative of domain-specific future survey outcomes. These results suggest that for smartphone-based digital phenotyping, metadata is not independent of patient-reported survey scores, and is therefore potentially useful in predicting future clinical outcomes. This work raises important questions and considerations for future studies; we explore and discuss some of these implications. © 2018, The Author(s).","Data reduction; Digital devices; Diseases; Smartphones; Accelerometer data; Data collection tools; Data quality; GPS survey; Individual levels; Personal digital devices; Phenotyping; Pilot studies; Scientific data; Smart phones; Article; clinical article; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; human; information processing; metadata; phenotype; pilot study; priority journal; reliability; schizophrenia; validity; Surveys","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135598390"

This paper highlights the significant impact of social components on health outcomes in a novel way. Introducing the concept of sociomarkers, which are measurable indicators of social conditions in which a patient is embedded, we employed a machine learning approach that uses both biomarkers and sociomarkers to identify asthma patients at risk of a hospital revisit after an initial visit with an accuracy of 66%. The analysis has been performed over an integrated dataset consisting of individual-level patient information such as gender, race, insurance type, and age, along with ZIP code-level sociomarkers such as poverty level, blight prevalence, and housing quality. Using this uniquely integrated database, we then compare the traditional biomarker-based risk model and the sociomarker-based risk model. A biomarker-based predictive model yields an accuracy of 65% and the sociomarker-based model predicts with an accuracy of 61%. Without knowing specific symptom-related features, the sociomarker-based model can correctly predict two out of three patients at risk. We systematically show that sociomarkers play an important role in predicting health outcomes at the individual level in pediatric asthma cases. Additionally, by merging multiple data sources with detailed neighborhood-level data, we directly measure the importance of residential conditions for predicting individual health outcomes. © 2018, The Author(s).","Diseases; Forecasting; Hospitals; Housing; Pediatrics; Risk assessment; biological marker; Health outcomes; Housing quality; Individual levels; Integrated database; Machine learning approaches; Patient information; Predictive models; Risk modeling; Social components; Social conditions; Article; asthma; child; female; health insurance; housing; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; neighborhood; patient assessment; patient information; patient risk; pediatric patient; poverty; priority journal; race; school child; social status; Biomarkers","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092618060"

To investigate this, we extracted posts from Twitter (using relevant hashtags), the Lung Cancer Support Group on Facebook and the Macmillan.org.uk lung cancer discussion forum for a single month. Interaction Process Analysis revealed that all three platforms were used more for giving than seeking information, opinion or suggestions. However, interaction types (including sentiment) varied between platforms, reflecting their digital architectures, user-base and inclusion of a moderator. For example, a higher percentage of information-seeking and sentiment marked the Macmillan.org.uk, compared with Twitter and the Facebook Group. Further analysis of the messages using a four-dimensional typology of social support revealed that emotional and informational support types were most prevalent on the Macmillan.org.uk forum, closely followed by the Facebook Group. Contrary to expectations, Twitter posts showed the most companionship support, reflecting the use of hashtags as user-generated signals of community belonging and interests. Qualitative analysis revealed an unanticipated sub-category of spiritual support, which featured uniquely in the Lung Cancer Support Group on Facebook. There was little evidence of trolling or stigma, although some users remarked that lung cancer was unfairly resourced compared with other cancers. These findings provide new insights about how people affected by lung cancer use social media and begin to elucidate the value of different platforms as channels for patient engagement and support, or as potential research data sources. © 2019, The Author(s).","Biological organs; Diseases; Information use; Social networking (online); Condition; Discussion forum; Facebook; Hashtags; Interaction process; Lung Cancer; Process analysis; Social dynamics; Social media; Support groups; Article; empathy; family; grief; human; information seeking; Internet; intimacy; love; lung cancer; priority journal; qualitative analysis; religion; social interaction; social media; social support; stigma; trust; Binary alloys","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606318"

Compared with the baseline, there was no significant difference in the total activity across all trusts during the week of the WannaCry attack. Trusts had 1% more emergency admissions and 1% fewer A&E attendances per day during the WannaCry week compared with baseline. Hospitals directly infected with the ransomware, however, had significantly fewer emergency and elective admissions: a decrease of about 6% in total admissions per infected hospital per day was observed, with 4% fewer emergency admissions and 9% fewer elective admissions. No difference in mortality was noted.

This meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of standalone smartphone apps for mental health. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in February 2018 on randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of standalone apps for mental health in adults with heightened symptom severity, compared to a control group. A random-effects model was employed. When insufficient comparisons were available, data was presented in a narrative synthesis. Outcomes included assessments of mental health disorder symptom severity specifically targeted at by the app. In total, 5945 records were identified and 165 full-text articles were screened for inclusion by two independent researchers. Nineteen trials with 3681 participants were included in the analysis: depression (k = 6), anxiety (k = 4), substance use (k = 5), self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (k = 4), PTSD (k = 2), and sleep problems (k = 2). Effects on depression (Hedges’ g = 0.33, 95%CI 0.10–0.57, P = 0.005, NNT = 5.43, I2 = 59%) and on smoking behavior (g = 0.39, 95%CI 0.21–0.57, NNT = 4.59, P ≤ 0.001, I2 = 0%) were significant. No significant pooled effects were found for anxiety, suicidal ideation, self-injury, or alcohol use (g = −0.14 to 0.18). Effect sizes for single trials ranged from g = −0.05 to 0.14 for PTSD and g = 0.72 to 0.84 for insomnia.

However, the validity and expected distribution of such measurements are unclear, making it difficult for physicians to help patients interpret real-world, remote and on-demand HR measurements. Our goal was to validate HR-PPG, measured using a smartphone app, against HR-electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements and describe out-of-clinic, real-world, HR-PPG values according to age, demographics, body mass index, physical activity level, and disease. To validate the measurements, we obtained simultaneous HR-PPG and HR-ECG in 50 consecutive patients at our cardiology clinic. We then used data from participants enrolled in the Health eHeart cohort between 1 April 2014 and 30 April 2018 to derive real-world norms of HR-PPG according to demographics and medical conditions. HR-PPG and HR-ECG were highly correlated (Intraclass correlation = 0.90). A total of 66,788 Health eHeart Study participants contributed 3,144,332 HR-PPG measurements. The mean real-world HR was 79.1 bpm ± 14.5. The 95th percentile of real-world HR was ≤110 in individuals aged 18–45, ≤100 in those aged 45–60 and ≤95 bpm in individuals older than 60 years old. In multivariable linear regression, the number of medical conditions, female gender, increasing body mass index, and being Hispanic was associated with an increased HR, whereas increasing age was associated with a reduced HR. Our study provides the largest real-world norms for remotely obtained, real-world HR according to various strata and they may help physicians interpret and engage with patients presenting such data. © 2019, The Author(s).","Electrocardiograms; Heart; Population statistics; Body mass; Emerging technologies; Heart-rate; Mass index; Medical conditions; On demands; Rate measurements; Real-world; Smart devices; Smart phones; adult; aged; Article; asthma; atrial fibrillation; body mass; cardiovascular mortality; cerebrovascular accident; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; electrocardiography; essential hypertension; ethnicity; female; heart arrhythmia; heart atrium flutter; heart cycle; heart left bundle branch block; heart rate; heart rate measurement; heart ventricle extrasystole; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypertension; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; patient-reported outcome; photoelectric plethysmography; physical activity; priority journal; race; resting heart rate; sinus tachycardia; sleep disordered breathing; step count; supraventricular premature beat; very elderly; young adult; Smartphones","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606216"

Until now, there is still no definitive screening method to confront the possibility of a misdiagnosis. We evaluate the possibilities of machine learning as a clinical decision support to determine the suitability to corneal refractive surgery. A machine learning architecture was built with the aim of identifying candidates combining the large multi-instrument data from patients and clinical decisions of highly experienced experts. Five heterogeneous algorithms were used to predict candidates for surgery. Subsequently, an ensemble classifier was developed to improve the performance. Training (10,561 subjects) and internal validation (2640 subjects) were conducted using subjects who had visited between 2016 and 2017. External validation (5279 subjects) was performed using subjects who had visited in 2018. The best model, i.e., the ensemble classifier, had a high prediction performance with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.983 (95% CI, 0.977–0.987) and 0.972 (95% CI, 0.967–0.976) when tested in the internal and external validation set, respectively. The machine learning models were statistically superior to classic methods including the percentage of tissue ablated and the Randleman ectatic score. Our model was able to correctly reclassify a patient with postoperative ectasia as an ectasia-risk group. Machine learning algorithms using a wide range of preoperative information achieved a comparable performance to screen candidates for corneal refractive surgery. An automated machine learning analysis of preoperative data can provide a safe and reliable clinical decision for refractive surgery. © 2019, The Author(s).","Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Learning algorithms; Surgery; Best model; Clinical decision; Clinical decision support; Corneal refractive surgery; Ensemble-classifier; Learning architectures; Machine-learning; Performance; Prediction performance; Screening methods; adult; article; classifier; controlled study; decision support system; female; high risk population; human; major clinical study; male; prediction; preoperative evaluation; receiver operating characteristic; refractive surgery; validation process; Machine learning","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606293"

Efficient and accurate AI analytics require fastidious data science—the careful curating of knowledge representations in databases, decomposition of data matrices to reduce dimensionality, and preprocessing of datasets to mitigate the confounding effects of messy (i.e., missing, redundant, and outlier) data. Messier, bigger and more dynamic medical datasets create the potential for ML computing systems querying databases to draw erroneous data inferences, portending real-world human health consequences. High-dimensional medical datasets can be static or dynamic. For example, principal component analysis (PCA) used within R computing packages can speed & scale disease association analytics for deriving polygenic risk scores from static gene-expression microarrays. Robust PCA of k-dimensional subspace data accelerates image acquisition and reconstruction of dynamic 4-D magnetic resonance imaging studies, enhancing tracking of organ physiology, tissue relaxation parameters, and contrast agent effects. Unlike other data-dense business and scientific sectors, medical AI users must be aware that input data quality limitations can have health implications, potentially reducing analytic model accuracy for predicting clinical disease risks and patient outcomes.

Constructing predictive statistical models typically requires extraction of curated predictor variables from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive process that discards the vast majority of information in each patient’s record. We propose a representation of patients’ entire raw EHR records based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. We demonstrate that deep learning methods using this representation are capable of accurately predicting multiple medical events from multiple centers without site-specific data harmonization. We validated our approach using de-identified EHR data from two US academic medical centers with 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at least 24 h. In the sequential format we propose, this volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945 data points, including clinical notes. Deep learning models achieved high accuracy for tasks such as predicting: in-hospital mortality (area under the receiver operator curve [AUROC] across sites 0.93–0.94), 30-day unplanned readmission (AUROC 0.75–0.76), prolonged length of stay (AUROC 0.85–0.86), and all of a patient’s final discharge diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90). These models outperformed traditional, clinically-used predictive models in all cases.

Current rapid HIV tests are typically analogue risking incorrect interpretation, no facile electronic data capture, poor linkage to care and data loss for public health. Smartphone-connected diagnostic devices have potential to dramatically improve access to testing and patient retention with electronic data capture and wireless connectivity. We report a pilot clinical study of surface acoustic wave biosensors based on low-cost components found in smartphones to diagnose HIV in 133 patient samples. We engineered a small, portable, laboratory prototype and dual-channel biochips, with in-situ reference control coating and miniaturised configuration, requiring only 6 µL plasma. The dual-channel biochips were functionalized by ink-jet printing with capture coatings to detect either anti-p24 or anti-gp41 antibodies, and a reference control. Biochips were tested with 31 plasma samples from patients with HIV, and 102 healthy volunteers. SH-SAW biosensors showed excellent sensitivity, specificity, low sample volumes and rapid time to result, and were benchmarked to commercial rapid HIV tests. Testing for individual biomarkers found sensitivities of 100% (anti-gp41) and 64.5% (anti-p24) (combined sensitivity of 100%) and 100% specificity, within 5 min. All positive results were recorded within 60 s of sample addition with an electronic readout. Next steps will focus on a smartphone-connected device prototype and user-friendly app interface for larger scale evaluation and field studies, towards our ultimate goal of a new generation of affordable, connected point-of-care HIV tests. © 2018, The Author(s).","Acoustic surface wave devices; Acoustic waves; Coatings; Diagnosis; Ink jet printing; Smartphones; antigen p24; glycoprotein gp 41; 'current; Clinical study; Data loss; Diagnostic device; Dual channel; Electronic data; Reference control; SAW biosensors; Smart phones; Wireless connectivities; Article; blood sampling; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; pilot study; point of care testing; priority journal; proof of concept; sensitivity and specificity; Biochips","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606023"

Its iTunes app store user ratings and reviews were generally positive. Whether underreporting of elevated BP improves user experience is unknown. Participants enrolled at five clinics estimated their BP, measured their BP with IBP, then completed a user experience survey. Participants were grouped based on how their IBP BP measurements compared to their estimated BP (IBP Lower, IBP Similar, or IBP Higher). Logistic regressions compared odds of rating “agree” or “strongly agree” on survey questions by group. Most participants enjoyed using the app. In the adjusted model, IBP Higher had significantly lower proportions reporting enjoyment and motivation to check BP in the future than IBP Similar. All three groups were comparable in perceived accuracy of IBP and most participants perceived it to be accurate. However, user enjoyment and likelihood of future BP monitoring were negatively associated with higher-than-expected reported systolic BP. These data suggest reassuring app results from an inaccurate BP-measuring app may have improved user experience, which may have led to more positive user reviews and greater sales. Systematic underreporting of elevated BPs may have been a contributor to the app’s success. Further studies are needed to confirm whether falsely reassuring output from other mobile health apps improve user experience and drives uptake. © 2018, The Author(s).","Blood; Digital storage; mHealth; Surveys; App stores; Blood pressure measurement; Blood-pressure monitoring; Logistics regressions; Pressure measuring; Systolic blood pressure; User rating; User reviews; Users' experiences; accuracy; adult; Article; blood pressure measurement; female; health survey; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; validation study; Blood pressure","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606147"

A variety of methods existing for generating synthetic EHRs, but they are not capable of generating unstructured text, like emergency department (ED) chief complaints, history of present illness, or progress notes. Here, we use the encoder–decoder model, a deep learning algorithm that features in many contemporary machine translation systems, to generate synthetic chief complaints from discrete variables in EHRs, like age group, gender, and discharge diagnosis. After being trained end-to-end on authentic records, the model can generate realistic chief complaint text that appears to preserve the epidemiological information encoded in the original record-sentence pairs. As a side effect of the model’s optimization goal, these synthetic chief complaints are also free of relatively uncommon abbreviation and misspellings, and they include none of the personally identifiable information (PII) that was in the training data, suggesting that this model may be used to support the de-identification of text in EHRs. When combined with algorithms like generative adversarial networks (GANs), our model could be used to generate fully-synthetic EHRs, allowing healthcare providers to share faithful representations of multimodal medical data without compromising patient privacy. This is an important advance that we hope will facilitate the development of machine-learning methods for clinical decision support, disease surveillance, and other data-hungry applications in biomedical informatics. © 2018, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Decision support systems; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Generative adversarial networks; Health care; Medical informatics; Natural language processing systems; Records management; Biomedical informatics; Data Sharing; Electronic health; Emergency departments; Encoder-decoder; Health care providers; Health records; Methodological research; Natural language generation; Unstructured texts; adult; age; aged; Article; electronic health record; female; human; language; learning algorithm; male; middle aged; predictive value; priority journal; validity; very elderly; young adult; Learning algorithms","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606125"

Several projects have augmented mirrors for a range of smarter applications in automobiles and homes. The opportunity to apply smart mirror technology to healthcare to predict and to monitor aspects of health and disease is a natural but mostly underdeveloped idea. We envision that smart mirrors comprising a combination of intelligent hardware and software could identify subtle, yet clinically relevant changes in physique and appearance. Similarly, a smart mirror could record and evaluate body position and motion to identify posture and movement issues, as well as offer feedback for corrective actions. Successful development and implementation of smart mirrors for healthcare applications will require overcoming new challenges in engineering, machine learning, computer vision, and biomedical research. This paper examines the potential uses of smart mirrors in healthcare and explores how this technology might benefit users in various medical environments.

However, clinicians lack the time and resource to annotate patient records with standard medical diagnostic codes and most veterinary visits are captured in free-text notes. The lack of standard coding makes it challenging to use the clinical data to improve patient care. It is also a major impediment to cross-species translational research, which relies on the ability to accurately identify patient cohorts with specific diagnostic criteria in humans and animals. In order to reduce the coding burden for veterinary clinical practice and aid translational research, we have developed a deep learning algorithm, DeepTag, which automatically infers diagnostic codes from veterinary free-text notes. DeepTag is trained on a newly curated dataset of 112,558 veterinary notes manually annotated by experts. DeepTag extends multitask LSTM with an improved hierarchical objective that captures the semantic structures between diseases. To foster human-machine collaboration, DeepTag also learns to abstain in examples when it is uncertain and defers them to human experts, resulting in improved performance. DeepTag accurately infers disease codes from free-text even in challenging cross-hospital settings where the text comes from different clinical settings than the ones used for training. It enables automated disease annotation across a broad range of clinical diagnoses with minimal preprocessing. The technical framework in this work can be applied in other medical domains that currently lack medical coding resources. © 2018, The Author(s).","Clinical research; Codes (symbols); Long short-term memory; Semantics; Clinical data; Clinical notes; Clinical records; Free texts; Large-scales; Medical diagnostics; Patient care; Patient record; Standard coding; Translational Research; accuracy; Article; automation; coding; conceptual framework; human; learning algorithm; nonhuman; patient care; priority journal; semantics; translational research; veterinary medicine; Diagnosis","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606326"

These approaches are time and skill intensive and therefore costly to an extent that precludes their use in many important scenarios.

We sought to explore the cost and effectiveness thresholds VR therapy must meet to be cost-saving as an inpatient pain management program. The result is a framework for hospital administrators to evaluate the return on investment of implementing inpatient VR programs of varying effectiveness and cost. Utilizing decision analysis software, we compared adjuvant VR therapy for pain management vs. usual care among hospitalized patients. In the VR strategy, we analyzed potential cost-savings from reductions in opioid utilization and hospital length of stay (LOS), as well as increased reimbursements from higher patient satisfaction as measured by the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. The average overall hospitalization cost-savings per patient for the VR program vs. usual care was $5.39 (95% confidence interval –$11.00 to $156.17). In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis across 1000 hypothetical hospitals of varying size and staffing, VR remained cost-saving in 89.2% of trials. The VR program was cost-saving so long as it reduced LOS by ≥14.6%; the model was not sensitive to differences in opioid use or HCAHPS. We conclude that inpatient VR therapy may be cost-saving for a hospital system primarily if it reduces LOS. In isolation, cost-savings from reductions in opioid utilization and increased HCAHPS-related reimbursements are not sufficient to overcome the costs of VR. © 2018, The Author(s).","Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Economic analysis; Investments; Patient treatment; Sensitivity analysis; Virtual reality; opiate; % reductions; Cost saving; Economics analysis; Health care providers; Healthcare systems; IS costs; Length of stay; Opioids; Pain management; Virtual reality therapies; adverse event; analgesia; anxiety disorder; Article; cost control; dizziness; drug cost; drug utilization; headache; health care cost; hospital patient; human; length of stay; major clinical study; motion sickness; nausea; pain; patient satisfaction; priority journal; reimbursement; virtual reality exposure therapy; visual analog scale; Hospitals","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606384"

We computed the fraction of people who visited a particular restaurant and later searched for terms indicative of food poisoning to identify potentially unsafe restaurants. We used this information to focus restaurant inspections in two cities and demonstrated that FINDER improves the accuracy of health inspections; restaurants identified by FINDER are 3.1 times as likely to be deemed unsafe during the inspection as restaurants identified by existing methods. Additionally, FINDER enables us to ascertain previously intractable epidemiological information, for example, in 38% of cases the restaurant potentially causing food poisoning was not the last one visited, which may explain the lower precision of complaint-based inspections. We found that FINDER is able to reliably identify restaurants that have an active lapse in food safety, allowing for implementation of corrective actions that would prevent the potential spread of foodborne illness. © 2018, The Author(s).","Diseases; Signal detection; Complex problems; Food poisoning; Food-borne illness; ITS applications; Location data; Lower precision; Machine-learning; Real world setting; Real-time detection; Web searches; Article; controlled study; epidemiological data; food poisoning; food safety; human; machine learning; major clinical study; priority journal; restaurant; time; Inspection","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606142"

During database screening, studies were included if they involved people who were exposed to a mHealth intervention with social features, to promote PA. We conducted a narrative synthesis of included studies and a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Nineteen studies were included: 4 RCTs, 10 quasi-experimental, and 5 non-experimental studies. Most experimental studies had retention rates above 80%, except two.

The distance walked during a 6-min walk test (6MWT) correlates well with patient claudication symptoms, so we developed the VascTrac iPhone app as a platform for monitoring PAD using a digital 6MWT. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy of the built-in iPhone distance and step-counting algorithms during 6MWTs. One hundred and fourteen (114) participants with PAD performed a supervised 6MWT using the VascTrac app while simultaneously wearing an ActiGraph GT9X Activity Monitor. Steps and distance-walked during the 6MWT were manually measured and used to assess the bias in the iPhone CMPedometer algorithms. The iPhone CMPedometer step algorithm underestimated steps with a bias of −7.2% ± 13.8% (mean ± SD) and had a mean percent difference with the Actigraph (Actigraph-iPhone) of 5.7% ± 20.5%. The iPhone CMPedometer distance algorithm overestimated distance with a bias of 43% ± 42% due to overestimation in stride length. Our correction factor improved distance estimation to 8% ± 32%. The Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) correlated poorly with steps (R = 0.365) and distance (R = 0.413). Thus, in PAD patients, the iPhone’s built-in distance algorithm is unable to accurately measure distance, suggesting that custom algorithms are necessary for using iPhones as a platform for monitoring distance walked in PAD patients. Although the iPhone accurately measured steps, more research is necessary to establish step counting as a clinically meaningful metric for PAD. © 2018, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Diseases; mHealth; Actigraph; Activity tracking; Blood flow; Clinical validations; Distance algorithm; Peripheral artery disease; Smart phones; Step counting; Vascular disease; Walk tests; accuracy; aged; algorithm; ankle brachial index; Article; feasibility study; female; human; major clinical study; male; pedometry; peripheral occlusive artery disease; priority journal; six minute walk test; stride length; validation study; walking distance; Smartphones","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089605905"

There is concern that the electronic health record is eroding the patient-clinician relationship and distancing clinicians from their patients. New analytic technologies, on the contrary, by taking over repetitive and mundane tasks, can provide an avenue to make medical care more patient-centered by freeing clinicians’ time, and the time of the whole clinical care team, to engage with patients. Technology such as advanced speech recognition that optimizes clinicians’ workflow could revitalize the patient-clinician relationship and perhaps also improve clinician well-being. Digital phenotyping can gain invaluable additional data from patients using technology that is already used for personal reasons by the majority of patients. The digital transformation of healthcare has the potential to make healthcare more humane and personalized, however, several important steps are needed to avoid the pitfalls that have come with prior iterations of information technology in medicine such as a heightened emphasis on data security and transparency. Both patients and clinicians should be involved from the early stages of development of medical technologies to ensure that they are person-centric. Technologists and engineers developing healthcare technologies should have experiences with the delivery of healthcare and the lives of patients and clinicians. These steps are necessary to develop a common commitment to the design concept that technology and humane care are not mutually exclusive, and in fact, can be symbiotic. © 2018, The Author(s).","Biomedical engineering; Medical computing; Medicine; Metadata; Speech recognition; Clinical care; Computer technology; Digital transformation; Electronic health; Health professionals; Health records; Medical community; Phenotyping; Well being; Work-flows; adult; clinician; computer security; electronic health record; health care delivery; human; humanism; information technology; medical care; medical technology; phenotype; review; speech discrimination; wellbeing; workflow; Health care","Nature Publishing Group","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606134"

We assessed what characterizes those users who connected a wearable device to the program to estimate sleep diary variables, and whether connecting a wearable device affected insomnia symptom improvement, related well-being, and program interaction. In total, 3551 users (63% female, mean age 44.50 ± 14.78 years) of a dCBT program who completed a post-therapy survey, including 378 users (10.6%) who used a device, were selected. Within-subject, pre-therapy to post-therapy, the Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI, 7 Items) was used to assess insomnia. Two-item measures (depression, anxiety) and single item measures (perceived stress, life satisfaction, work productivity) of well-being were analyzed, in addition to program interaction. For all participants, insomnia symptoms significantly improved following dCBT (t(3504) = 83.33, p < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 1.45), as did depression and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, life satisfaction and work productivity. Those who did not connect a device reported better sleep and less affected work productivity (all p <.001) than those who did connect a device at baseline and post-treatment; nevertheless treatment effects were largely similar for the two groups. Those who connected a device interacted more with additional program components. In conclusion, improvements in insomnia after completing dCBT are similar in persons choosing to wear a wearable device to estimate sleep and persons completing a subjective sleep diary. Potentially, use of wearable devices can facilitate treatment for those who struggle to complete daily diaries. © 2018, The Author(s).","Productivity; Sleep research; Wearable technology; alcohol; caffeine; hypnotic agent; Cognitive-behavioral therapies; Condition indicators; Large-scales; Mean ages; Stress-life; Therapy devices; Wearable devices; Well being; Well projects; Work productivity; adult; anxiety; Article; cognitive behavioral therapy; controlled study; depression; digital cognitive behavioral therapy; drinking behavior; female; human; insomnia; life satisfaction; major clinical study; male; obesity; patient satisfaction; Perceived Stress Scale; polysomnography; priority journal; productivity; shift worker; sleep; sleep quality; smoking; wellbeing; Digital devices","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606079"

Their potential for improving self-management of chronic conditions is significant. Here, we propose a concept of “prescribable” mHealth apps, defined as apps that are currently available, proven effective, and preferably stand-alone, i.e., that do not require dedicated central servers and continuous monitoring by medical professionals. Our objectives were to conduct an overview of systematic reviews to identify such apps, assess the evidence of their effectiveness, and to determine the gaps and limitations in mHealth app research. We searched four databases from 2008 onwards and the Journal of Medical Internet Research for systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of stand-alone health apps. We identified 6 systematic reviews including 23 RCTs evaluating 22 available apps that mostly addressed diabetes, mental health and obesity. Most trials were pilots with small sample size and of short duration. Risk of bias of the included reviews and trials was high. Eleven of the 23 trials showed a meaningful effect on health or surrogate outcomes attributable to apps. In conclusion, we identified only a small number of currently available stand-alone apps that have been evaluated in RCTs. The overall low quality of the evidence of effectiveness greatly limits the prescribability of health apps. mHealth apps need to be evaluated by more robust RCTs that report between-group differences before becoming prescribable. Systematic reviews should incorporate sensitivity analysis of trials with high risk of bias to better summarize the evidence, and should adhere to the relevant reporting guideline. © 2018, The Author(s).","Health risks; mHealth; Sensitivity analysis; Central servers; Chronic conditions; Continuous monitoring; Internet research; Medical professionals; Randomized controlled trial; Self management; Server monitoring; Stand -alone; Systematic Review; body weight loss; clinical effectiveness; diabetes mellitus; human; obesity; physical activity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; Risk assessment","Nature Publishing Group","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606210"

We analyzed data on 67 women (mean age = 77.5 years) who participated in the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health (OPACH) study within the Women’s Health Initiative and in an accelerometer calibration substudy. Participants completed the short physical performance battery (SPPB), questions about falls in the past year, and a timed 400-m walk while wearing a hip triaxial accelerometer (30 Hz). Women with SPPB ≤ 9 and 1+reported falls (n = 19) were grouped as high fall risk; women with SPPB = 10–12 and 0 reported falls (n = 48) were grouped as low fall risk. Random Forests were trained to classify women into these groups, based upon traditional measures of gait and/or signal-based features extracted from accelerometer data. Eleven models investigated combined feature effects on classification accuracy, using 10-fold cross-validation. The models had an average 73.7% accuracy, 81.1% precision, and 0.706 AUC. The best performing model including triaxial data, cross-correlations, and traditional measures of gait had 78.9% accuracy, 84.4% precision, and 0.846 AUC. Mediolateral signal-based measures—coefficient of variance, cross-correlation with anteroposterior accelerations, and mean acceleration—ranked as the top 3 features. The classification accuracy is promising, given research on probabilistic models of falls indicates accuracies ≥80% are challenging to achieve. The results suggest accelerometer-based measures captured during walking are potentially useful in screening older women for fall risk.

For healthcare infrastructure, the answer is population measurement, monitoring people to compute status for clustering cohorts. In chronic care, most effective is measuring all the time, to track health status as it gradually changes. Passive monitors run in the background, without additional tasks to activate monitors, especially on mobile phones. At its core, a health system is a “sorting problem”. Each patient entering the system must be effectively sorted into treatment cohorts. Health systems have three primary problems: Case Finding (which persons have which diagnoses), Risk Stratification (which persons are which status), and Care Routing (which persons need which treatments). The issue is then which measures can be continuously monitored at appropriate periodicity. The solutions of population measurement measure vital signs with passive monitors. These are input to predictive analytics to detect clinical values for providing care within health systems. For chronic care, complex vitals must be measured for overall status, such as oxygen saturation or gait speed. This enables healthcare infrastructure to support stratification, with persons placed into current levels of health status. Practical considerations for health systems influence implementation of new infrastructure. Case finding is more likely to be useful in urban settings, with barriers to entry based upon lower incomes. Care routing is more likely to be useful in rural settings, with barriers to entry based upon isolated geographies. Viable healthcare at acceptable quality and affordable cost is now possible for the range of geographies and incomes. © 2018, The Author(s).","Diagnosis; Health risks; Patient treatment; Chronic care; Clinical value; Clusterings; Health status; Health systems; Healthcare infrastructure; Measurement monitoring; Risk stratification; Routings; Vital sign; Article; geography; health care access; health care cost; health care policy; health care quality; health care system; health status; human; measurement; population; priority journal; public health problem; Predictive analytics","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606279"

Digital scribes or intelligent documentation support systems, take advantage of advances in speech recognition, natural language processing and artificial intelligence, to automate the clinical documentation task currently conducted by humans. Whilst in their infancy, digital scribes are likely to evolve through three broad stages. Human led systems task clinicians with creating documentation, but provide tools to make the task simpler and more effective, for example with dictation support, semantic checking and templates. Mixed-initiative systems are delegated part of the documentation task, converting the conversations in a clinical encounter into summaries suitable for the electronic record. Computer-led systems are delegated full control of documentation and only request human interaction when exceptions are encountered. Intelligent clinical environments permit such augmented clinical encounters to occur in a fully digitised space where the environment becomes the computer. Data from clinical instruments can be automatically transmitted, interpreted using AI and entered directly into the record. Digital scribes raise many issues for clinical practice, including new patient safety risks. Automation bias may see clinicians automatically accept scribe documents without checking. The electronic record also shifts from a human created summary of events to potentially a full audio, video and sensor record of the clinical encounter. Digital scribes promisingly offer a gateway into the clinical workflow for more advanced support for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tasks. © 2018, The Author(s).","Computer control systems; Gateways (computer networks); Natural language processing systems; Records management; Speech recognition; Clinical documentation; Current generation; Electronic health; Electronic records; Health records; Language processing; Mixed-initiative systems; Natural languages; Simple++; Support systems; Article; artificial intelligence; automation; clinical practice; electronic health record; human; medical documentation; natural language processing; patient safety; patient satisfaction; priority journal; risk assessment; semantics; speech discrimination; workflow; Semantics","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074380326"

Taking advantage of the high prevalence of mobile phones, we deployed a national SMS-poll and collected data about individual-level health and health-seeking behavior throughout the outbreak from 6694 individuals from March to June 2015 in Liberia. Using propensity score matching to generate balanced subsamples, we compared outcomes in our survey to those from a recent household survey (the 2013 Liberian Demographic Health Survey). We found that the matched subgroups had similar patterns of delivery location in aggregate, and utilizing data on the date of birth, we were able to show that facility-based deliveries were significantly decreased during, compared to after the outbreak (p < 0.05) consistent with findings from retrospective studies using healthcare-based data. Directly assessing behaviors from individuals via SMS also enabled the measurement of public and private sector facility utilization separately, which has been a challenge in other studies in countries including Liberia which rely mainly on government sources of data. In doing so, our data suggest that public facility-based deliveries returned to baseline values after the outbreak. Thus, we demonstrate that with the appropriate methodological approach to account for different population denominators, data sourced via mobile tools such as SMS polling could serve as an important low-cost complement to existing data collection strategies especially in situations where higher-frequency data than can be feasibly obtained through surveys is useful. © 2018, The Author(s).","Diseases; Population statistics; Surveys; Emergency situation; Health surveys; Healthcare utilization; Household surveys; Individual levels; Measurements of; Population levels; Propensity score matching; Similar pattern; West Africa; adult; aged; Article; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; epidemic; government; health care; health care delivery; health care utilization; help seeking behavior; human; information processing; major clinical study; priority journal; propensity score; Cellular telephones","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606058"

However, these devices generally lack the form factor and mechanical flexibility necessary for use in ambulatory and home environments. Here, we report an ultrathin (~1 mm average thickness) and highly flexible wearable cardiac sensor (WiSP) designed to be minimal in cost (disposable), light weight (1.2 g), water resistant, and capable of wireless energy harvesting. Theoretical analyses of system-level bending mechanics show the advantages of WiSP’s flexible electronics, soft encapsulation layers and bioadhesives, enabling intimate skin coupling. A clinical feasibility study conducted in atrial fibrillation patients demonstrates that the WiSP device effectively measures cardiac signals matching the Holter monitor, and is more comfortable. WiSP’s physical attributes and performance results demonstrate its utility for monitoring cardiac signals during daily activity, exertion and sleep, with implications for home-based care. © 2018, The Author(s).","Flexible electronics; Heart; Patient monitoring; Wearable sensors; Ambulatory monitoring; Cardiac signals; Disposables; Form factors; Heart-rate monitoring; Mechanical flexibility; Monitoring device; Optical-; Physiological signals; Remote monitoring; adult; aged; ambulatory monitoring; Article; atrial fibrillation; clinical article; device comparison; electrocardiogram; equipment design; feasibility study; female; heart rate; Holter monitoring; human; male; priority journal; remote sensing; Energy harvesting","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606036"

However, these algorithms must be trained with annotated data from clinical experts who can recognize symptoms, and collecting such data are costly. Understanding how many sensors and how much labeled data are required is key to successfully deploying these models outside of the clinic. Here we recorded movement data using 6 flexible wearable sensors in 20 individuals with PD over the course of multiple clinical assessments conducted on 1 day and repeated 2 weeks later. Participants performed 13 common tasks, such as walking or typing, and a clinician rated the severity of symptoms (bradykinesia and tremor). We then trained convolutional neural networks and statistical ensembles to detect whether a segment of movement showed signs of bradykinesia or tremor based on data from tasks performed by other individuals. Our results show that a single wearable sensor on the back of the hand is sufficient for detecting bradykinesia and tremor in the upper extremities, whereas using sensors on both sides does not improve performance. Increasing the amount of training data by adding other individuals can lead to improved performance, but repeating assessments with the same individuals—even at different medication states—does not substantially improve detection across days. Our results suggest that PD symptoms can be detected during a variety of activities and are best modeled by a dataset incorporating many individuals. © 2018, The Author(s).","Chemical detection; Data acquisition; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Neural networks; Clinical assessments; Convolutional neural network; Data stream; Detection models; Labeled data; Machine learning algorithms; Movement datum; Neural network's ensemble; Statistical ensembles; Symptom detections; adult; aged; Article; bradykinesia; brain depth stimulation; clinical article; clinical assessment; comparative study; daily life activity; data analysis; diagnostic accuracy; disease severity; electric potential; electromyography; female; human; male; medical record; Parkinson disease; prevalence; priority journal; random forest; speech discrimination; task performance; tremor; walking; Wearable sensors","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606336"

This case report describes the technical aspects of integrating data from a popular smartphone platform to a commonly used EHR vendor and explores the challenges and potential of this approach for disease management. Consented subjects using the Asthma Health app (built on Apple’s ResearchKit platform) were able to share data on inhaler usage and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) with a local pulmonologist who ordered this data on Epic’s EHR. For users who had installed and activated Epic’s patient portal (MyChart) on their iPhone and enabled sharing of health data between apps via HealthKit, the pulmonologist could review PGHD and, if necessary, make recommendations. Four patients agreed to share data with their pulmonologist, though only two patients submitted more than one data point across the 4.5-month trial period. One of these patients submitted 101 PEFR readings across 65 days; another submitted 24 PEFR and inhaler usage readings across 66 days. PEFR for both patients fell within predefined physiologic parameters, except once where a low threshold notification was sent to the pulmonologist, who responded with a telephone discussion and new e-prescription to address symptoms. This research describes the technical considerations and implementation challenges of using commonly available frameworks for sharing PGHD, for the purpose of remote monitoring to support timely care interventions. © 2018, The Author(s).","Data integration; Diseases; mHealth; Patient monitoring; Patient treatment; Acute exacerbations; Case reports; Chronic illness; Disease management; Health data; Mobile app; Patient portal; Peak expiratory flows; Smart phones; Technical aspects; Article; asthma; clinical article; human; information processing; medical record; peak expiratory flow; priority journal; pulmonologist; remote sensing; Smartphones","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606236"

Real-time, objective activity data may allow for a more accurate assessment of PS and physical function, while reducing the subjectivity and bias associated with current assessments. Consenting patients with advanced cancer wore a wearble activity monitor for three consecutive visits in a prospective, single-cohort clinical trial. Provider-assessed PS (ECOG/Karnofsky) and NIH PROMIS® patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed at each visit. Associations between wearable activity monitor metrics (steps, distance, stairs) and PS, clinical outcomes (adverse events, hospitalizations, survival), and PROs were assessed using correlation statistics and in multivariable logistic regression models. Thirty-seven patients were evaluated (54% male, median 62 years). Patients averaged 3700 steps, 1.7 miles, and 3 flights of stairs per day. Highest correlations were observed between average daily steps and ECOG-PS and KPS (r = 0.63 and r = 0.69, respectively p < 0.01). Each 1000 steps/day increase was associated with reduced odds for adverse events (OR: 0.34, 95% CI 0.13, 0.94), hospitalizations (OR: 0.21 95% CI 0.56, 0.79), and hazard for death (HR: 0.48 95% CI 0.28–0.83). Significant correlations were also observed between activity metrics and PROs.

Digital therapeutics, such as computerized cognitive–emotional training interventions, represent a promising new strategy for treating MDD. Here we report a replication of efficacy of a digital cognitive–emotional training intervention designed to enhance cognitive control for emotional information-processing. In a randomized, double-blind, controlled study design, 51 participants with MDD in a current major depressive episode were randomly assigned to participate in a digital cognitive–emotional training regimen (Emotional Faces Memory Task (EFMT); n = 28) involving 18 sessions over 6 weeks, or an active control condition (CT; n = 23) involving computerized working memory training. MDD symptoms were assessed weekly using a clinician-rated measure (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; Ham-D); and neurocognition (working memory), at baseline and study outcome. Mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of all participants randomized revealed a significantly greater reduction in MDD symptom severity (Ham-D) from baseline to outcome in the EFMT group (8.65 points) compared to the CT group (4.77 points) (F(6,205) = 3.23, p =.005, d = 0.46). Ten of 28 EFMT participants achieved clinical response (≥50% reduction in symptoms) compared to 4 of 23 in CT. Both groups exhibited similar, small improvements in working memory. This replicated the preliminary efficacy of a digital cognitive–emotional training approach for the treatment of MDD. EFMT may be a feasible and effective intervention strategy for MDD, but future studies to elucidate its mechanism of action are warranted.

Dysgraphia, characterized as a handwriting learning disability, is usually associated with dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder (dyspraxia), or attention deficit disorder, which are all neuro-developmental disorders. Dysgraphia can seriously impair children in their everyday life and require therapeutic care. Early detection of handwriting difficulties is, therefore, of great importance in pediatrics. Since the beginning of the 20th century, numerous handwriting scales have been developed to assess the quality of handwriting. However, these tests usually involve an expert investigating visually sentences written by a subject on paper, and, therefore, they are subjective, expensive, and scale poorly. Moreover, they ignore potentially important characteristics of motor control such as writing dynamics, pen pressure, or pen tilt. However, with the increasing availability of digital tablets, features to measure these ignored characteristics are now potentially available at scale and very low cost. In this work, we developed a diagnostic tool requiring only a commodity tablet. To this end, we modeled data of 298 children, including 56 with dysgraphia. Children performed the BHK test on a digital tablet covered with a sheet of paper. We extracted 53 handwriting features describing various aspects of handwriting, and used the Random Forest classifier to diagnose dysgraphia. Our method achieved 96.6% sensibility and 99.2% specificity. Given the intra-rater and inter-rater levels of agreement in the BHK test, our technique has comparable accuracy for experts and can be deployed directly as a diagnostics tool. © 2018, The Author(s).","Diagnosis; 20th century; Attention deficit disorder; Developmental coordination disorders; Developmental disorders; Diagnostics tools; Dyspraxia; Human levels; Learning disabilities; Reading skills; Writing skills; algorithm; Article; automation; body position; child; clinical assessment; clinical feature; controlled study; dysgraphia; false negative result; false positive result; handwriting; human; machine learning; major clinical study; motor control; pressure; priority journal; random forest; Decision trees","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606251"

Brief interventions delivered by mobile phone could overcome this challenge. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a mobile phone text message intervention (YourCallTM) on hazardous drinkers admitted for an injury. The parallel two-group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial enrolled 598 injured patients aged 16–69 years identified as medium-risk drinkers at recruitment. The intervention group (n = 299) received 16 text messages incorporating brief intervention principles in the 4 weeks following discharge from hospital. Controls (n = 299) received usual care and one text message acknowledging participation in the trial. The primary outcome was the difference in hazardous alcohol use (assessed using AUDIT-C) between study groups at 3 months, with the maintenance of effect examined at 6 and 12 months’ follow-up. Data were analysed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Both groups had similar baseline features. Compared to controls, hazardous drinking was significantly lower in the intervention group at 3 months and maintained over the 12-month follow-up period (least squares mean difference in AUDIT-C scores: −0.322; 95% CI: −0.636, −0.008; p = 0.04).

Fields such as oncology have progressed toward data-driven clinical decision-making that combines subjective clinical assessment of symptoms and preferences with biological measures such as genetics, biomarkers, imaging, and integrative physiology to derive quantitative risk scores and decision support. In contrast, psychiatry has just begun to scratch the surface of measurement-based care with validated clinical questionnaires. An opportunity exists to improve modern psychiatric care with novel data streams from digital sensors combined with clinical observation and subjective self-report. The prospect of integrating this complex information with modern computational and analytical methods could advance the field, both in research and clinical practice. Here we discuss this possibility and propose some key priorities to enable these innovations toward improving clinical outcomes in the future. © 2018, The Author(s).","Clinical research; Decision support systems; Metadata; Risk assessment; Surveys; Clinical assessments; Clinical decision making; Data driven; Decision supports; Digital measurement; Measurement tools; Measurement-based; Quantitative risk; Risk decision; Risk score; clinical assessment tool; clinical decision making; clinical observation; clinical outcome; digital measurement tool; human; machine learning; mental health care; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; psychiatry; Review; self report; Decision making","Nature Publishing Group","Review","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606198"

Despite this, there are few published reports of drug safety profiles derived in this way. The aims of this study were to detect and quantify glucocorticoid-related adverse events using a computerised system for automated detection of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADR) from narrative text in Twitter, and to compare the frequency of specific ADR mentions within Twitter to the frequency and patterns of spontaneous ADR reporting to a national drug regulatory body. Of 159,297 tweets mentioning either prednisolone or prednisone between 1st October 2012 and 30th June 2015, 20,206 tweets were deemed to contain information resembling an ADR. The top AE MedDRA® Preferred Terms were ‘insomnia’ and ‘weight increased’, both recognised non-serious but common side effects. These were proportionally over-reported in Twitter when compared to spontaneous reports in the UK regulator’s ADR reporting scheme. Serious glucocorticoid related AEs were reported less frequently. Pharmacovigilance using Twitter data has the potential to be a valuable, supplementary source of drug safety information. In particular, it can illustrate which drug side effects patients discuss most commonly, potentially because of important impacts on quality of life. This information could help clinicians to inform patients about frequent and relevant non-serious side effects as well as more serious side effects. © 2018, The Author(s).","Hormones; prednisolone; prednisone; Adverse drug reactions; Adverse events; Computerized systems; Drug safety; Glucocorticoids; Safety information; Side effect; Social media websites; Twitter posts; Weight gain; abdominal pain; abnormal dreaming; anxiety disorder; Article; body weight gain; consciousness disorder; corticosteroid therapy; depression; drug effect; drug safety; face edema; fatigue; human; hyperhidrosis; increased appetite; insomnia; malaise; mental instability; priority journal; restlessness; skin discomfort; social media; somnolence; swelling; text messaging; United Kingdom; withdrawal syndrome; Social networking (online)","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089606197"

However, the need for human interpretation has limited echocardiography’s full potential for precision medicine. Deep learning is an emerging tool for analyzing images but has not yet been widely applied to echocardiograms, partly due to their complex multi-view format. The essential first step toward comprehensive computer-assisted echocardiographic interpretation is determining whether computers can learn to recognize these views. We trained a convolutional neural network to simultaneously classify 15 standard views (12 video, 3 still), based on labeled still images and videos from 267 transthoracic echocardiograms that captured a range of real-world clinical variation. Our model classified among 12 video views with 97.8% overall test accuracy without overfitting. Even on single low-resolution images, accuracy among 15 views was 91.7% vs. 70.2–84.0% for board-certified echocardiographers. Data visualization experiments showed that the model recognizes similarities among related views and classifies using clinically relevant image features.

Here, we recorded all touchscreen smartphone interactions at a sub-second precision and show that the unconstrained day-to-day behavior captured on the phone reflects in the simple sensorimotor computations measured in the laboratory. The behavioral diversity on the phone, the speed of interactions, the amount of social & non-social interactions, all uniquely influenced the trial-to-trial motor variability used to measure the amount of intrinsic neuronal noise. Surprisingly, both the motor performance and the early somatosensory cortical signals (assessed using EEG in passive conditions) became noisier with increased social interactions. Inter-individual differences in how people use the smartphone can help thus decompose the structure of low-level sensorimotor computations. © 2018, The Author(s).","Brain; Behavioral diversity; Condition; Inter-individual differences; Motor performance; Neuronal noise; Sensorimotors; Simple++; Smart phones; Social interactions; Somatosensory; adult; Article; behavior; comparative study; controlled study; electroencephalogram; event related potential; female; human; human experiment; male; motor control; motor performance; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; normal human; priority journal; reaction time; sensorimotor function; social behavior; social interaction; somatosensory cortex; tactile stimulation; text messaging; touch; Smartphones","Nature Publishing Group","Article","Final","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092236788"
